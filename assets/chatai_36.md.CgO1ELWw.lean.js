When it comes to the longest first half field goal in NFL history, the answer is Tom Dempsey, who kicked a remarkable 63-yard field goal in the first half of a game between the New Orleans Saints and the Detroit Lions on November 8, 1970. Dempsey's kick remains as a legendary achievement in the NFL, as he did not have any toes in his right foot due to a birth defect. Instead, he wore a specialized shoe with a flat, rectangular front that allowed him to kick the ball with power and accuracy. His 63-yard kick set a new record for the longest field goal in NFL history, breaking the previous record of 56 yards set by Bert Rechichar in 1953 and tied by Mark Moseley in 1977. Dempsey's record stood for an incredible 43 years until it was finally broken in 2013 by Matt Prater, who kicked a 64-yard field goal for the Denver Broncos in a game against the Tennessee Titans. However, Prater's kick came in the second half of the game, meaning that Dempsey's record for the longest first half field goal still stands to this day. The ability to make long field goals is a crucial part of any kicker's game, and Dempsey's incredible achievement stands as a testament to the power of determination and dedication. Despite facing significant challenges due to his birth defect, he was able to overcome his limitations and achieve greatness in one of the most difficult aspects of the game of football.

Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from preexisting schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education.

Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner.

According to Continetti, while Palin's impulsive moves have yielded positive results in the past, speculations about her presidential ambitions are premature. Continetti emphasizes that Palin's actions carry weight in the political arena, regardless of whether or not she decides to run for president. \\"Whatever she does will be noticed,\\" he states, highlighting the fact that Palin remains a prominent figure in American politics. Indeed, Palin's impulsive moves have often energized her base and attracted media attention. For example, her endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016 helped solidify his support among conservative voters, and her selection as John McCain's vice presidential nominee in 2008 galvanized the Republican base. However, Continetti also notes that Palin's impulsive nature can be a double-edged sword. Her controversial statements - such as her accusation that Obama's healthcare plan included \\"death panels\\" - have often raised eyebrows and led to criticism from both sides of the political aisle. Ultimately, Continetti suggests that it is too early to predict Palin's political future. While she remains a force to be reckoned with in conservative circles, it is unclear whether her impulsive nature will translate into a successful presidential bid.

It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask? Gravitational potential energy has the ability to cause motion.

Keeping your essential medication and toiletries in a clear, resealable bag can help you stay organized and quickly access them when needed. You can also consider packing a few extra items such as sunscreen, insect repellent, and a mini first aid kit to avoid any unexpected emergencies. When it comes to your electronics, it's best to pack them near the top of your suitcase. This way, you can quickly access them at security checkpoints without having to dig through all of your belongings. Your tickets, passport, and other essential travel documents should be kept in a folder or envelope to protect them from damage or loss.

A recent YouTube video from influencer Josh Paler Lin has gone viral, sparking intense debates online. In the video, Lin is seen giving a beggar named Thomas 100 and then filming him as he spends the cash on food for his homeless friends. In a second clip, Lin treats Thomas to a number of luxuries, including a haircut, a new outfit, and a meal at a restaurant. However, many skeptics have picked holes in the footage, accusing Lin of staging the whole thing for the sake of clicks. Some have pointed out that Thomas appears to be wearing a watch in the first clip, which is odd for a homeless person. Others have questioned why Lin would choose to film himself giving cash to a random beggar in the first place. Despite the backlash, Thomas insists that the events in the video were not staged and that he had never met Lin before. Speaking to reporters, he said that he was grateful for the money and that he wanted to use it to help others. “I never thought a simple 100 would cause such a commotion,” he said.

Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see Accuracy). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would drift further. Lilius proposed that the 10day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March.

The companies argue that this is a quick fix for the tricky social and cultural issues around motherhood in the workplace. However, many writers have cautioned against buying into this policy as a solution. Critics argue that by offering egg freezing, the policy is placing the responsibility on individual women to plan their fertility around their careers. Instead, they argue, companies should be implementing policies that ease the strain on working mothers and fathers. For example, offering greater flexibility in work hours or location, or guaranteeing benefits such as paid parental leave. In an ideal world, women wouldn't have to choose between their careers and motherhood. By offering egg freezing, companies are tacitly accepting this false dichotomy. Rather than investing in reproductive technology, companies should be investing in creating a more equitable workplace that supports women, parents, and caregivers. Of course, the decision to freeze one's eggs is a personal one, and for some women it may be a welcome option.

The figures are taken from the Corporation's central booking system. But staff can also book taxis themselves and claim the money back on expenses, meaning the full taxi is spend will be even higher.","output":"The BBC Corporation has come under scrutiny regarding its spending on taxi bills. According to the figures obtained from the Corporation's central booking system, the corporation ran up a taxi bill of nearly £31,450 a day or 236,675 license fees. The figures show that BBC spent £10.7 million in 2011-12, £11.8 million in 2012-13 and £11.9 million in 2013-14 on taxis alone. What caught the attention of many is the staggering amount of over £200,000 being spent on taxis that were cancelled on arrival. It is a matter of concern that this type of carelessness is not rare within the Corporation, indicating a need for the proper management of its finances. It must be noted that the actual amount spent on taxis could even be higher than the figures revealed, as staff members can book taxis themselves and claim the money back on expenses. This loophole makes the total amount spent on taxis by the Corporation something that is of grave concern. Such a degree of spending on taxis efficiently highlights the mismanagement of the finances within the corporation. The improper management of financial resources and funds can lead to further setbacks and reductions within the corporation. The Corporation ought to bring in new measures and policies to ensure that such malpractices do not happen in the future. The issue of the BBC’s taxi bills creates unease among the public as these costs ultimately contribute to the license fee they pay. To gain back public trust, the Corporation needs to reassess its policies and procedures concerning the use of taxis by staff members. It is only by doing so that the BBC can demonstrate a commitment to using its resources wisely and being accountable to the public it serves."},{"instruction":"Does Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the midinfrared part of the spectrum. correctly answer the question of What kind of lasers are crystals of zinc suflde used in?

According to data from the World Bank, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was 8.1%, while in Japan it was only 4.3%. This difference in unemployment rates can be attributed to various factors. One of the reasons for the difference in unemployment rates is the economic policies of each country. The U.S. was still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis, which had a significant impact on the job market. During this period, many companies were forced to reduce their workforce, resulting in an increase in unemployment. Japan, on the other hand, had implemented policies to address their high unemployment rate after their financial crisis in the late 1990s, including increasing public spending and creating a flexible labor market. Another factor contributing to the difference in unemployment rates is the level of education and skills of the workforce. In the U.S., many people without a college degree have been unable to find stable employment, while in Japan, there is a greater emphasis on vocational training programs that prepare workers for specific jobs. Lastly, the demographic composition of each country can also impact the unemployment rate. Japan's rapidly aging population has resulted in a shrinking labor force, which has led to a lower unemployment rate. In contrast, the U.S. has a larger, more diverse population with varying levels of education and skills. Overall, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was higher than in Japan in 2012. While various factors contribute to the difference, a focus on economic policies, education, and demographics may help improve the job market in both countries."},{"instruction":"(1) The FAA and ICAO are working on a Sonic Boom standard to enable supersonic flights overland .

He fears his weight will balloon when he retires from wrestling in 2014.","output":"Manny Yarbrough, a former American sumo wrestler, weighs a staggering amount, three times as much as the world-renowned sprint champion Usain Bolt. The weight difference between the two is enormous, and it's hard to imagine any two human beings could be so different in size. But for Yarbrough, his immense weight has been a part of his life for as long as he can remember. Yarbrough's concerns about his weight have only increased since he retired from wrestling in 2014. As an athlete, he had to maintain his weight and stay in form, but without the structure of competition, he fears that his weight may balloon. This concern is not uncommon among retired athletes, particularly those who have been known for their size or speed, and Yarbrough is right to be worried about his health. Carrying excess weight, as Yarbrough does, can cause a range of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and joint pain. But the risks are not only physical; being overweight can also impact mental health, causing depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. It's important that Yarbrough takes steps to manage his weight after retiring from wrestling. There are a number of ways that Yarbrough can manage his weight in retirement. He could start by adjusting his diet to reduce his calorie intake and include more fruits, vegetables, and whole foods. Physical exercise is also crucial in managing weight, so he might consider enlisting the help of a personal trainer to develop a workout program that suits his needs. It's important to note that managing weight is not an easy task, nor is it something that can be done overnight. For Yarbrough, it will be a lifelong effort, and it's essential that he finds a strategy that works for him. But with the right mindset and support, he can maintain his health and keep his weight under control. Ultimately, what matters most is that Yarbrough makes his health a priority, and takes the steps necessary to live a healthy and fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"for bush backers , the light they perceived at the end of the postelection day tunnel turned out to be an oncoming judicial freight train .

The Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, effectively ending the hostilities on the Western Front. However, it would take several months of negotiations to finalize the terms of the peace treaty, known as the Treaty of Versailles. Meanwhile, the victorious Allied powers established a series of occupation zones in Germany, including the Rhineland region. At the time, Rhineland was a significant industrial hub and home to many of Germany's military installations, including its largest armaments factories. The four countries that occupied Rhineland were Belgium, France, United Kingdom, and the United States. Each country was responsible for controlling its designated region and maintaining order in the area. The occupation was supposed to last until the Treaty of Versailles was signed, ratified, and all reparations were paid in full. The French had the most significant presence in Rhineland, with troops stationed in the region until 1930. They believed that Germany posed a significant threat to their national security and sought to keep a close eye on the country as it rebuilt its military and economy. The French also implemented a series of measures to ensure that Germany could not rearm, including strict limitations on the size and scope of its military forces. Belgian forces also occupied a section of Rhineland, focused mainly in the east. Their presence was less militaristic but rather more economic. They aimed to ensure that Germany paid its war reparations under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The United Kingdom's presence in Rhineland was short-lived, as they only occupied a small part of the region. Their focus was on disarming Germany and removing any potential threats to the British home countries. The United States also played a role in the Rhineland occupation, though it was more limited than the other three countries. US forces were responsible for the Koblenz region, and their presence was focused on maintaining stability in the area. In conclusion, after the Armistice of 1918, Rhineland was occupied by armies from four different countries: Belgium, France, United Kingdom, and the United States. They were responsible for maintaining order, disarming Germany and ensuring that the country paid its war reparations. The occupation lasted until 1930, and the region played a crucial role in shaping the future of Germany and Europe as a whole."},{"instruction":"The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place.

Put treats out of sight. Schedule your workouts. Reduce stress. Plan a holiday workout routine. Keep warm.","output":"With the holiday season fast approaching, many of us are already planning the feast that awaits us. However, as much as we all love indulging in these festive treats, it's essential to balance it out with some healthy habits. Here are some tips to help you stay on track this holiday season. Firstly, it's a good idea to go easy on the calories the week before the festivities begin. You don't need to be restrictive or skip meals, but try to stick to a healthy diet and avoid overeating as much as possible. This will make it easier to control your portions when you're faced with delicious treats later on. Next, put treats out of sight. With so many delicious treats around, it can be hard to resist temptation. To avoid overindulging, don't leave sweets and chocolates lying around in plain sight. Stash them away where you can't see them so that you won't be tempted to snack unnecessarily. Scheduling workouts is also a great way to stay on track over the holidays. Instead of using the busy season as an excuse to skip your gym routine, plan your workouts in advance so that you can still fit them in. Even if it's a quick 20-minute jog or a yoga session at home, every bit of exercise will help keep you on track. Reducing stress is also crucial during the holiday season. Make sure to take some time to relax and unwind, whether it's with a long soak in the bath, a good book, or some calming music. When you're feeling stress-free, it's easier to resist temptations and make healthy choices. It's also a good idea to plan a holiday workout routine to keep yourself motivated. Find a few workouts that you enjoy and that fit into your schedule, whether it's a yoga class, a dance session or a gym routine. As long as you're moving and staying active, you'll be making progress towards your health goals. Finally, keep warm during the cold winter months. One of the biggest reasons for skipping workouts or overindulging in comfort food is because we're feeling cold and miserable. Invest in some warm and comfortable workout gear, and make sure your home is heated to a comfortable temperature. When you're feeling warm and cozy, you'll be more motivated to stay active and make healthy choices. In conclusion, it's entirely possible to enjoy the holidays while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By following these tips and making small adjustments to your routine, you can stay on track and avoid overindulging in festive treats. Remember, it's all about balance – so go ahead, enjoy that slice of pie, but make sure to balance it out with some healthy habits. Happy Holidays!"},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question.

One easy solution to this maddening problem is to mix equal parts water and vinegar. The white vinegar will help remove the stain and any odors it may have caused.

It may take several applications to completely remove the stain and its odor, so be patient and repeat the process until satisfaction. After the stain has been removed, simply let the mattress dry overnight, ideally outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. This step allows the moisture to evaporate safely and naturally, which prevents unwanted mold and mildew growth.

Allow the solution to sit for a minute or two, then let the mattress dry again completely before use. The alcohol will not only get rid of odor-causing bacteria and mold, but will also help disinfect the mattress.

However, the jury ultimately agreed with the defence's argument that Brooks was simply too \\"daft\\" to knowingly break the law. The prosecution had argued that Brooks had deliberately concealed the materials in a bid to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking at News International. They claimed that this was evidence of a wider criminal conspiracy involving Brooks and his wife. However, the defence sought to paint a different picture of Brooks as a bumbling, naive man who had acted without thinking. They argued that he had simply hidden the materials out of embarrassment rather than with any intention to deceive the police. In the end, the jury sided with the defence's version of events, acquitting Brooks of all charges. But the case raised questions about the extent to which ignorance or stupidity can be used as a defence in criminal trials. Some legal experts have argued that allowing defendants to claim ignorance of the law could lead to a slippery slope where anyone accused of a crime could simply claim that they didn't know any better. Others have pointed out that this defence has long existed in English law, under the principle of mens rea (or guilty mind).

Miliband claims that the proposal was drawn up hastily, dubbing it something that was put together \\"on the back of a fag packet\\" by the UK PM. Miliband, whose party has 41 MPs in Scotland, argued that the proposal would lead to \\"our Parliament being split up\\", something he is \\"not in favour of a Commons that becomes divided\\". The debate over Scottish independence has put significant pressure on the political parties to address the West Lothian question, the issue of Scottish MPs being able to vote on laws relating only to England in the UK Parliament. Miliband's attempt to keep the UK Parliament unified, and his reservations about \\"English votes for English laws,\\" are understandable in this context. Furthermore, while there is a good deal of support for greater devolution for Scotland, that does not necessarily translate to calls for such devolution for England. Cameron has been arguing that if Scotland gets new powers, so should England. However, the Labour leader's concerns about a split parliament are likely shared by many in the House of Commons. It is worth noting that the issue of Scottish independence is far from over, and the eventual outcome will likely have a significant impact on the next general election. With 41 MPs in Scotland, Labour could potentially form a majority government next year, something that may add to the debate over the West Lothian question. Overall, Miliband's cautious approach to addressing the issue of English devolution is understandable, given the pressures on the UK Parliament following the Scottish independence referendum.

He concluded that this outcome was unlikely to have occurred by chance, and that therefore, the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses. He suspected that editors tended to favor trees with two branches, as this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment (as there would be no third branch to break the tie whenever the witnesses disagreed).

After the Rus' attack on Constantinople in 860, the Byzantine Patriarch Photius sent missionaries north to convert the Rus' and the Slavs. Prince Rastislav of Moravia had requested the Emperor to provide teachers to interpret the holy scriptures, so in 863 the brothers Cyril and Methodius were sent as missionaries, due to their knowledge of the Slavonic language. The Slavs had no written language, so the brothers devised the Glagolitic alphabet, later developed into Cyrillic, and standardized the language of the Slavs, later known as Old Church Slavonic. They translated portions of the Bible and drafted the first Slavic civil code and other documents, and the language and texts spread throughout Slavic territories, including Kievan Rus’.

Select a bold statement for a dynamic introduction. Choose a simple story to illustrate where your writing will go. Write an example for a concrete way to introduce your topic. Opt for a broad statement for a straightforward approach. Ask a question to get the reader thinking. Avoid starting with a definition unless it is truly relevant.","output":"\\"First impressions are everything\\" – Unknown. When it comes to writing, the first impression a reader has of your article can either make or break its success. This is why it's essential to start with a strong introduction that grabs the reader's attention and compels them to continue reading. There are several ways to achieve this. One approach is to begin with a quote that succinctly sums up the topic of your article. For example, \\"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower\\" by Steve Jobs could be used for an article on the importance of innovation in business. Another effective method is to make a bold statement that immediately piques the reader's interest. For instance, \\"The sky is not blue\\" could be used for an article on the science of color perception. A simple story can also be an impactful way to introduce your topic. Suppose you're writing about the benefits of a plant-based diet. In that case, you could start by sharing a personal anecdote about how switching to a vegetarian lifestyle improved your health and well-being. Providing a concrete example is yet another effective approach. For an article on the importance of goal-setting, you could use a real-life example of a successful athlete or entrepreneur who attributed their achievement to setting and achieving specific goals. If you prefer a more straightforward approach, a broad statement can be a great way to introduce your article. For example, \\"In today's fast-paced world, stress is a common problem that affects millions of people,\\" could be used for an article on stress reduction techniques. Asking a question is another effective way to engage the reader and get them thinking. For an article on the future of technology, you could begin by asking, \\"What will the world look like in 10 years, and how will technology shape our lives?\\" Finally, it's best to avoid starting with a definition unless it's absolutely necessary. While definitions can help clarify complex terms, they're not always the most exciting way to start an article. Suppose you're writing about a medical condition or scientific theory that requires a definition. In that case, it's crucial to keep it brief and use language that's accessible to the average reader. In conclusion, as a writer, you have several options when it comes to introducing your article. Selecting a compelling approach that best aligns with the content will create a strong impression on the reader, ultimately leading to an outstanding piece of writing."},{"instruction":"Question 1: What are some cool potential applications of IBM Watson in the logistics industry?

This was not always the case, however: the Catholic Church has gone through several phases in kinship prohibitions. At the dawn of Christianity in Roman times, marriages between first cousins were allowed. For example, Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Roman Emperor, married his children to the children of his halfbrother. First and second cousin marriages were then banned at the Council of Agde in AD 506, though dispensations sometimes continued to be granted. By the 11th century, with the adoption of the socalled canonlaw method of computing consanguinity, these proscriptions had been extended even to sixth cousins, including by marriage. But due to the many resulting difficulties in reckoning who was related to whom, they were relaxed back to third cousins at the Fourth Lateran Council in AD 1215. Pope Benedict XV reduced this to second cousins in 1917, and finally, the current law was enacted in 1983.

However, upon closer examination, we can determine a rough estimate of the time frame. To begin, we must define what is meant by the first and last rebellion. Depending on the context, there may be multiple potential rebellions to consider. For example, in the history of the United States, one might consider the first rebellion to be the American Revolution in the late 1700s, while the last rebellion could be the Civil War in the mid-1800s. Assuming we are referring to a specific context, such as a particular country or region, we can begin to examine historical records and accounts of rebellions. It is important to note that rebellions may take many forms and may not always be labeled as such in historical documentation. However, we can look for instances of unrest, uprisings, and resistance movements that may fall under the umbrella of rebellion. Once we have identified the relevant rebellions, we can calculate the time elapsed between the first and last. Depending on the frequency and duration of rebellions in the region, this time frame may vary considerably. Additionally, the causes and outcomes of rebellions may also affect the time between them. For example, if a successful rebellion leads to significant changes in the political or social system, subsequent rebellions may be less likely to occur or may take different forms. In conclusion, determining the exact number of years between the first and last rebellion is a complex task that depends on the specific context and historical records.

This find shows that there is a significant difference in the cost of tickets across different football leagues in the UK. It is important to note that the cost of match-day tickets can vary depending on several factors, including the team's location, their performance in the league, and their popularity among fans. This makes it difficult to compare prices across the board, especially when it comes to the Premier League. However, the overall trend seen in the survey shows that football tickets are becoming increasingly expensive, and may be unaffordable for some fans. This trend has been a cause for concern among football supporters for some time, as they feel that the price of watching their favourite teams play is becoming too high. Overall, the survey results highlight how the cost of match-day tickets can vary significantly between different football leagues in the UK. With football supporters expressing concerns about the rising prices of tickets, it is up to clubs to ensure that watching their favourite sport remains as affordable as possible."},{"instruction":"To my students taking a PSSA test, well, you know, I being an educator, I'm not in love with PSSA tests or standardized tests.

Avoid containers made from hazardous plastics. Clean the containers thoroughly. Disinfect water from unsafe sources Filter out contaminants.","output":"Storing Water: A Guide to Ensuring Clean and Safe Drinking Water When it comes to preparing for emergencies, having access to clean and safe drinking water is essential. However, not all sources of water are reliable, and unclean water can lead to serious health problems. Therefore, it is important to store water ahead of time, and take the necessary precautions to ensure that it is safe to drink. The first step in storing water is to decide how much you need. The general recommendation is to have at least one gallon of water per person per day, with a minimum of three days’ worth of water stored. However, depending on your family size and needs, you may want to store more. Bottled water is an easy and convenient way to store water. Look for water that comes in sturdy, reuseable containers made from materials such as glass or food-grade plastic. Avoid containers made from hazardous plastics, such as those that contain bisphenol-A (BPA), a chemical that can seep into the water and cause health problems. If you choose to store water in your own containers, make sure they are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected first. Use soap and warm water to scrub the inside and outside of the container, then rinse it well with hot water. To disinfect the container, mix a solution of one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per quart of water, fill the container with the solution, and let it sit for at least 30 seconds before rinsing it out completely. If you need to use water from an unsafe source, such as rainwater, a stream, or a well, you should filter out any contaminants before drinking it. There are many types of filters available, from simple straws that you can use to drink straight from the source, to more advanced gravity-fed systems that can filter out bacteria, viruses, and other harmful particles. In summary, storing water for emergencies can be a lifesaving decision, but it is important to take the necessary steps to ensure that the water is clean and safe to drink. Decide how much water you need, consider using bottled water or safe containers, clean and disinfect containers thoroughly, and filter out any contaminants from unsafe sources. With these precautions in place, you can rest assured that you and your family will have access to clean and safe drinking water in times of need."},{"instruction":"w would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @Gingernyc That would great!

They theorized that pain intensity (the sensory discriminative dimension) and unpleasantness (the affectivemotivational dimension) are not simply determined by the magnitude of the painful stimulus, but higher cognitive activities can influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness. Cognitive activities may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affectivemotivational dimension. Thus, excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain, while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affectivemotivational dimension and leave the sensorydiscriminative dimension relatively undisturbed. (p. 432) The paper ends with a call to action: Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block, surgical intervention and the like, but also by influencing the motivationalaffective and cognitive factors as well.

Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.

However, there were some small gains made by the GOP with Latino and Asian-American voters. Political commentator Eric Liu believes that if political parties want to avoid voter apathy, they need to compete for voters in all groups. This means making a conscious effort to connect with minority groups and address their concerns in a meaningful way. By investing time and resources into these communities, political parties can build trust and solidarity with groups that have traditionally been overlooked. While the GOP's gains with Latino and Asian-American voters may seem modest, they are a step in the right direction. By reaching out to these groups and engaging with their concerns, the GOP has shown a willingness to expand their base beyond their traditional demographic. If they can build on this momentum and continue to connect with diverse communities, they may find that they have a stronger foothold in future elections. Ultimately, the key to beating voter apathy is to listen to voters' concerns and take action to address them. By doing so, political parties can build trust and engagement with all voters, regardless of their background or identity.
