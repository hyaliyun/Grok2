New institutions were now needed in the face of social, economic, and political changes. The Taihō Code lapsed, its institutions relegated to ceremonial functions.

Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family.

In fact, bestselling author Rachel Simmons explains that this behavior is showing up at younger ages than ever before. So what is behind this trend? One significant factor may be the way girls are portrayed in mainstream media. According to a study from the University of Michigan, there is a significant impact on girls after watching shows featuring socially aggressive women. These shows communicate to young girls that this type of behavior is acceptable, or even desirable. As a result, they may begin to emulate these behaviors in their own lives. Kelly Wallace, a prominent journalist and mother of three, is taking on provocative and hard-hitting parenting questions in her \\"Brutally Honest\\" video series. In one episode, she addresses the issue of mean girl behavior and encourages parents to take an active role in shaping their child's media consumption. Wallace suggests that parents should monitor the television shows, movies and social media accounts their children are consuming. Additionally, parents should also engage in open dialogue with their children about the messages they are receiving from the media. By doing so, parents can help their children navigate the complex and often difficult terrain of adolescence. It is important to note that the issue of mean girl behavior is not limited to girls alone. It is a cultural problem that affects both boys and girls. However, by starting the conversation and taking an active role in shaping our children's media consumption, we can help create a more positive and healthy environment for our young people."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The initiative provides funding to states in exchange for reforms. The Chicago schools strike could influence the outcome of the debate, expert says. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The Race to the Top initiative was introduced as a means of providing funding to states in exchange for educational reforms. However, the initiative has also led to an increase in fights over teacher responsibility. With the recent Chicago schools strike, experts are suggesting that the outcome of the debate could be heavily influenced. The Race to the Top initiative was introduced in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The program offers funding to states that implement significant education reforms, such as improving teacher effectiveness, increasing accountability, and adopting better standards and assessments. However, in exchange for this funding, states are required to implement these reforms quickly, which has led to controversies over teacher responsibility. The Chicago schools strike of 2019 is an example of how these controversies can play out. The strike was the longest in the city's history, lasting 11 school days. The main issue at the heart of the strike was the role of teachers in student achievement. The Chicago Teachers Union argued that teachers can't be held responsible for poor student performance unless they are given adequate resources and support. They called for more social workers, nurses, and librarians in schools, as well as smaller class sizes and better pay. Experts believe that the outcome of the Chicago schools strike could have a significant impact on future education policies across the country. With so much at stake, both sides are digging in their heels, making it difficult to find common ground. It remains to be seen whether the emphasis will be placed on teacher accountability or on providing teachers with the resources they need to succeed. In conclusion, the Race to the Top initiative has led to an increased focus on teacher responsibility in education. The recent Chicago schools strike highlights how disagreements over this issue can lead to long, contentious battles. As the debate continues, it's important to remember that teachers play a critical role in student success, and that they deserve the support and resources necessary to do their jobs to the best of their abilities."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Machinists' union votes in favor of building Boeing's new jet in Washington state.

Whether you work from home or in an office, there are several key factors to consider in order to ensure a workspace that is both functional and comfortable. One crucial element to consider is storage. Clutter can be a major source of stress and distraction, so it's important to find a system that works well for storing your supplies and paperwork. This might mean investing in a filing cabinet or shelving unit, or simply implementing a system of labeled boxes or trays. Another important consideration is managing wires and cables. With so many electronic devices in use today, wires can quickly become a tangled mess. Take the time to sort and label your cords, and consider using a cord management system or zip ties to keep things organized. Keeping your workspace clean is also crucial for maintaining productivity. Make it a habit to wipe down surfaces regularly, dispose of trash promptly, and straighten up at the end of each day. Not only will this create a more pleasant environment, but it will also help you stay focused on your work. Finally, be sure to choose the right furniture for your office. Whether it's a comfortable chair or a spacious desk, your furniture should be both functional and comfortable. Think about your working style and what will make you most productive and comfortable for extended periods of time, while ensuring it fits your budget.

The stance of Lyons and other Labor rebels against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the Great Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives. With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed party won a landslide victory at the 1931 Election, and the Lyons Government went on to win three consecutive elections. It largely avoided Keynesian pumppriming and pursued a more conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons' death in 1939 saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war. Menzies served as Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941 but resigned as leader of the minority World War II government amidst an unworkable parliamentary majority.

He says Chris Christie's chances at presidency would be stronger if he stayed in center. Christie appeals to Democratic voters; running to the right would lose them, Zelizer says. Zelizer: The most successful GOP presidential candidates have pushed moderate themes.","output":"Julian Zelizer, a celebrated American historian and political analyst, has recently challenged the conventional wisdom surrounding Republican presidential candidates. In his opinion, the idea that GOP candidates must shift to the right to gain popular support is a myth. Instead, Zelizer argues that the most successful Republican candidates have embraced moderate themes and appealed to a broad base of voters, including independents and moderate Democrats. As an example, Zelizer points to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who he believes would increase his chances of winning the presidency by staying in the center rather than shifting to the right. Christie, who has been touted as a potential presidential candidate, currently enjoys widespread appeal among Democratic voters in his home state. Zelizer claims that if Christie were to pivot to the right to court conservative Republican voters, he would likely lose the support of these Democratic voters and fail to broaden his appeal. Zelizer's argument reflects a growing trend within the Republican Party towards moderation and more centrist policies. This trend has been driven in part by the changing demographics of the United States, which have put pressure on Republicans to expand their appeal beyond their traditional base. As the country has become more diverse and more socially liberal, Republicans have struggled to gain traction with younger voters and minority groups. While some on the right have pushed back against this trend, Zelizer's analysis suggests that embracing moderate themes may be the key to winning a presidential election. By appealing to a broader base of voters and avoiding the extremes of the political spectrum, Republican candidates may increase their chances of success in what promises to be a fiercely contested election cycle. In conclusion, Julian Zelizer's analysis challenges the conventional wisdom surrounding Republican presidential candidates. Rather than pivoting to the right to gain support, he argues that the most successful GOP candidates have embraced moderate themes and appealed to a broad base of voters. As the Republican Party continues to grapple with demographic changes and changing social attitudes, Zelizer's insights may prove invaluable in shaping the party's future."},{"instruction":"(1) Jacopo Silvestri ( 16th 15th century ) was an Italian cryptographer and author .

Heat rapidly to about 1450ºF (790ºC). Flash vent the kiln to about 1000ºF (540ºC). Anneal the glass. Let the kiln cool to room temperature.","output":"To properly fire glass in a kiln, specific temperature and timing instructions must be followed. The following steps outline the process of firing a kiln to 1100ºF (590ºC), holding for ten minutes, heating more slowly to 1300ºF (700ºC), rapidly heating to about 1450ºF (790ºC), flash venting the kiln to about 1000ºF (540ºC), annealing the glass, and letting the kiln cool to room temperature. First, fire the kiln to 1100ºF (590ºC) and hold this temperature for ten minutes. This step helps to remove any moisture that may be present in the glass and ensure that the temperature is even throughout the kiln. Next, heat the kiln more slowly to 1300ºF (700ºC). This gradual increase in temperature allows the glass to expand evenly and avoid cracking or breaking. Once the kiln reaches 1300ºF (700ºC), heat it rapidly to about 1450ºF (790ºC). This quick increase in temperature helps to create a beautiful, smooth glass surface and it also allows the glass to fully fuse together. After heating the kiln to 1450ºF (790ºC), flash vent the kiln to about 1000ºF (540ºC). This step involves opening the kiln and letting cool air in to rapidly reduce the temperature. Flash venting is important because it helps to prevent thermal shock, which can cause the glass to crack or break. Next, anneal the glass. Annealing involves slowly cooling the glass to room temperature to reduce internal stress and improve its durability.

Whether it be with a partner, friend, family member or colleague, communication is key to maintaining healthy relationships. When we talk to one another, we not only learn about the other person but ourselves as well. Asking important questions helps to deepen and enrich our understanding of each other. It also allows us to explore topics that we may not have considered before, ultimately leading to personal growth and development. Another way to strengthen communication in relationships is through deeper, more meaningful discussions. These conversations go beyond surface-level small talk and touch on topics that are more personal and important to both individuals. By engaging in these conversations, we can build a stronger emotional connection with each other. Expressing love and appreciation for one another is also essential to maintaining healthy relationships. Leaving love notes for your partner or telling your friend how grateful you are for their support can go a long way in making someone feel valued and loved. Despite our best efforts, sometimes we may need additional support in our relationships. This is where seeking the help of a therapist can be beneficial. A therapist can provide a safe space for individuals to share their worries and joys with one another. They can also offer tools for effective communication and problem-solving. In conclusion, making the effort to communicate, asking important questions, having deeper discussions, leaving love notes, considering therapy, and sharing in our worries and joys are all ways to create strong and fulfilling relationships.

It does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan, as long as they can get past the silly story line, that must have been dated even in 1980.

More recently, emotion is said to consist of all the components. The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. In psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states. A similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology.

However, the key to becoming successful is to learn from them. By reflecting on your mistakes and identifying what you could have done differently, you can develop stronger coping strategies and become more self-reliant. It's important to remember that self-reliance doesn't mean never seeking help from others. If you're struggling to identify the behaviors you would like to change, seeking professional help can be incredibly beneficial. A therapist or coach can help you identify patterns in your behavior and provide guidance on how to make meaningful changes. However, at its core, self-reliance means taking responsibility for your own life and not relying on others to solve your problems. This includes standing up for yourself and the life you want. Instead of waiting for others to make decisions for you, take charge of your own life and make choices that align with your values and goals. In summary, learning from mistakes, developing self-reliant coping strategies, seeking professional help when needed, and taking ownership of your life are all key components to a successful and fulfilling life.

It was a confrontation between a group of Covenanters and government forces, which resulted in a decisive victory for the latter. The Covenanters were a group of Scottish Presbyterians who believed in the necessity of a \\"covenant\\" between God and the people, and who had been persecuted by the government for their beliefs. The Battle of Drumclog, on the other hand, occurred on June 1, 1679, more than a decade after the Battle of Rullion Green. It was also fought between government forces and Covenanters, this time in Lanarkshire. The Covenanters had gathered at Drumclog to protest against the government's attempts to impose Episcopalianism, a form of church governance that they deemed to be contrary to their religious beliefs. Although the Battle of Rullion Green may have provided some inspiration for the Covenanters at Drumclog, the two events were separated by a significant amount of time. In fact, a number of other conflicts between Covenanters and government forces took place in the intervening years, as tensions continued to simmer between these two groups. In conclusion, the Battle of Drumclog occurred more than a decade after the Battle of Rullion Green. While the former may have been influenced by the latter, they were separate events that took place in different locations and under different circumstances. Understanding the historical context of these battles is crucial for gaining an appreciation of the complex religious and political struggles of Scotland's past."},{"instruction":"London (CNN What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The article is not provided.

U.S has greatest consumption of the syrup by far amounting to 25kg per person a year, compared to 0.5kg in the UK.","output":"Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup has been linked to an increased risk of diabetes. Studies have shown that countries that use large amounts of this syrup have diabetes rates 20% higher than those that consume smaller amounts. Of all the countries, the United States has the greatest consumption of the syrup. The average American consumes about 25kg of high-fructose corn syrup per year, which is 50 times more than the average person in the United Kingdom. High-fructose corn syrup is a cheap sweetener that is used in many processed foods and drinks. It is often added to soft drinks, sweets, and baked goods. The syrup is made by converting cornstarch into glucose, and then adding enzymes that convert some of the glucose into fructose. The resulting syrup is much sweeter than regular sugar, and is also cheaper to produce. The use of high-fructose corn syrup has been a topic of controversy for years. Some argue that it is safe to consume in moderation, while others believe that it is responsible for the rise in obesity and diabetes. Studies have shown that the syrup can contribute to weight gain, as it is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause a spike in insulin levels. High levels of insulin can lead to insulin resistance, which is a risk factor for diabetes. Despite this, many food and drink manufacturers continue to use high-fructose corn syrup in their products. This is partly due to the fact that it is cheaper than other sweeteners, but also because it enhances the flavor of foods and drinks. However, there has been a growing movement towards using natural sweeteners, such as honey and maple syrup, in place of high-fructose corn syrup. In conclusion, the consumption of high-fructose corn syrup has been linked to an increased risk of diabetes. The United States, which has the greatest consumption of the syrup, has a diabetes rate that is 20% higher than countries that consume smaller amounts. While there is still debate over the safety of high-fructose corn syrup, many are calling for a reduction in its use in processed foods and drinks."},{"instruction":"ere is a premise: A man wearing a green shirt with white stripes is playing the drums Here is a hypothesis: The drummer in a band is practicing his solo. .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?

Harvesting gladiolus correctly is crucial to ensure that the flowers remain fresh and beautiful for as long as possible. The best time to harvest gladiolus is in the morning when one or two of the bottom flowers have started to open. To begin harvesting, carefully cut the stalk at an angle with gardening shears or a sharp knife. It's essential to leave at least four leaves on the stem to help the plant regenerate for the next season. After cutting, immediately place the stems in a container of water to prevent wilting. Using a clean container is crucial because bacteria can quickly build up and cause the flowers to rot. Make sure to change the water every other day to prevent bacteria from growing and affecting the longevity of the blooms. Once the gladiolus flowers are harvested and placed in water, they can be used to create stunning floral arrangements or displayed in a vase.

In contemporary times, both Germany and the UK have large populations, with Germany's population estimated at around 83 million and the UK's at around 66 million as of 2021. However, in the past, the populations of these two countries have fluctuated significantly due to factors such as war, migration, and social trends. For example, during the early 20th century, German populations started to decline due to the effects of World War I and the economic turmoil of the Weimar Republic. Meanwhile, the UK saw significant population growth due to factors such as increased immigration, longer life expectancies, and improved healthcare. However, during and after World War II, the UK experienced a decline in population due to wartime losses and reduced birthrates. Overall, it can be difficult to definitively say which group has seen a greater proportion of the global population throughout history.

However, Obama's absence from the Arlington event has been met with criticism from some quarters, with a blogger suggesting that it shows a lack of respect for veterans. Despite this, other veterans groups have defended the former president's decision, pointing out that other presidents have also missed the ceremony in the past. Memorial Day is a time when Americans honor those who have died while serving in the country's armed forces. It is a day when people across the nation come together to pay tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. For many, visiting cemeteries and attending ceremonies is a way to express their gratitude and appreciation to those who have served. Former President Obama has often used Memorial Day as an opportunity to honor the country's veterans. In previous years, he has spoken at Arlington and has visited troops stationed overseas. However, this year, he will be attending the ceremony at the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Illinois instead. This decision has been criticized by some, who see it as a snub to those buried at Arlington. A blogger wrote that Obama's absence from Arlington shows a lack of respect for those who have fought and died for their country, and that it is a disappointing decision. However, other veterans groups have been more understanding. They point out that other presidents, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, have also missed the Arlington ceremony in the past. They argue that attending a ceremony at a different cemetery is still a way to pay tribute to those who have served and that there is no need to criticize Obama's decision. In the end, Memorial Day is a time to reflect on the sacrifices made by the nation's veterans.

Republican National Committee, she says, has stepped up outreach to the black community. Wall: The media practices a double standard by not going after Democrats who have issues with race. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Tara Wall, a former senior communications adviser for the Republican National Committee (RNC), has criticized CNN and the media for their supposed unfair criticism of the GOP on issues of race. Wall made the statement on a recent appearance on CNN's \\"Newsroom,\\" where she argued that the RNC has made a concerted effort to reach out to the black community, and yet this effort has not been recognized or respected by the media. Wall also accused the media of practicing a double standard when it comes to issues of race, arguing that they are not as quick to call out Democrats for their own supposed shortcomings on the issue. According to Wall, this creates a situation where Republican politicians are unfairly singled out and criticized, while their Democratic counterparts are given a pass. The Republican party has indeed made recent efforts to reach out to minority communities, particularly the black community. In 2020, the RNC launched a 10 million \\"Black Voices for Trump\\" campaign, which aimed to engage black voters and promote the GOP's policies and candidates. However, the success of this campaign is up for debate, as President Trump received just 12% of the black vote in the 2020 election, according to exit polls. While it is true that Democrats have not been immune to criticism on issues of race, it is debatable whether or not this criticism has been equal to that faced by Republicans. The media did, for example, widely cover racial controversies involving Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and his lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, both Democrats. However, it is also true that Republicans have faced their fair share of controversies on this issue, such as former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's remarks praising segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond. In conclusion, while there is certainly room for criticism of the media's coverage of issues of race and politics, Tara Wall's arguments are perhaps overstated. The Republican party's outreach to the black community is commendable, but it remains to be seen whether or not it will be successful. And while Democrats have not been immune to criticism on this issue, Republicans have also faced their fair share of controversy."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this Let it sit before you make it public.

These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses.

Test the amber with nail polish remover containing acetone.","output":"When shopping for amber, it is important to exercise caution to ensure you purchase a genuine and high-quality product. As one of the most sought-after gemstones on the market, amber can be difficult to distinguish from other materials that may be passed off as the real deal. Here are some tips to help you shop for amber like a pro. Firstly, consider the color of the amber. Amber comes in a range of colors, including pale yellow, orange, brown, and even green. However, it is the opaque and cloudy amber that is most valuable. Beware of overly clear and bright amber, which may indicate it has been treated or is not genuine. Secondly, expect to see veins and inclusions in the amber. These are natural imperfections that add to the beauty and uniqueness of the stone. If the amber looks too perfect or flawless, it may not be real. Thirdly, perform a float test on the amber. This involves placing the stone in a glass of water. Genuine amber will float due to its low density, while imitations such as plastic or glass will sink. Fourthly, try the hot needle test. Heat up a needle or pin and gently press it against an inconspicuous part of the amber. The heat should create a tiny burn mark and the area will smell like burnt pine. If the mark does not appear, the amber may be synthetic. Finally, test the amber with nail polish remover containing acetone. Apply a small amount of the remover to a hidden part of the amber and see if it reacts. Genuine amber will not be affected by acetone, but imitations made using plastic or other materials will begin to dissolve. In conclusion, shopping for amber requires a discerning eye and a bit of testing. By considering the color, looking for natural imperfections, performing the float and hot needle tests, and testing with nail polish remover, you can help ensure you purchase a genuine and high-quality piece of amber."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: As an important railroad and road junction and production center, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign.

OPTIONS: This allows you to paint from the top down rather than from the bottom. For a glossy finish, use a stick or aluminum home paint brush. For white or smooth baseboards, try using a soft blue for a soft finish, one round brush for white or glossy finishes, and two round brushes for a glossy finish. Paint in a straight line down the middle of the baseboard. When buying paint pads, look for ones in a full color. The leather side needs to be parallel to the wood so the paint doesn't look streaky or dirty. Use standard latex paint for your baseboards. This type of paint will clean easily if you get scuff marks on the boards.","output":"Use standard latex paint for your baseboards.

Mom forces daughter to eat vegetables and get ready for bed. Expert advises parents to play with kids after arriving home. Also it's easier for nannies to discipline kids because they're not the moms.

Although it's common to feel jealous when someone spends more time with your child than you do, it's important to remember that nannies can be an essential part of your family's support system. One of the reasons for jealousy can stem from feeling like the nanny is doing a better job of parenting than the mother. For example, fighting over vegetables at dinner or getting ready for bed can be a continuous struggle, but a nanny may have an easier time handling these tasks since they're not the primary caregiver. The best approach is to communicate with your nanny and establish a routine that works for everyone. Experts also stress that parents should prioritize quality time with their children. Playing with your child after you come home from work is a simple yet effective way to bond and strengthen your relationship with them. Lastly, it's important to remember that nannies can serve as teachers and role models for your children. They may have a different approach to discipline, but that doesn't mean it's any less effective. In fact, allowing your nanny to discipline your child can also help establish boundaries and promote respect. In conclusion, hiring a nanny can be a great decision for your family, but it's important to prioritize open communication and establish a routine that works for everyone. Remember to make the most of the time you have with your child and trust that your nanny has your child's best interests at heart."},{"instruction":"the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"positive"},{"instruction":"After my last interraction with him , I had decided that he told me the truth and really did n't have any issue with me .

However, discussing this issue can be uncomfortable and difficult. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to make the conversation more productive and less stressful. First, be okay with feeling uncomfortable. This is a tough conversation to have, but avoiding it will not make the problem disappear. Rather than putting it off or avoiding it altogether, choose a time to talk when you are both relaxed and undistracted. When you do initiate the conversation, approach him in compassion, not judgment. It’s important to let him know that you care about him and that you recognize that addiction is a complex issue. Tell him how his drinking affects you, but avoid placing blame. Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. For example, instead of saying “you always drink too much,” say “when you drink, I feel worried and anxious.” It’s also important to ask your husband to get treatment. Many people try to force their partner to quit drinking or go to rehab immediately, but this often leads to resistance and defensiveness. Instead, start the conversation by expressing your concern and asking him if he would be willing to get help. This gives him the chance to make the decision himself and take ownership of it. While it is important to have the conversation, it’s important to avoid creating an action plan right away. This may seem counterintuitive, but it’s best to give your husband some time to process what you’ve said and come to his own decision about seeking treatment. This is a big decision and may require some thought and preparation. Remember, change takes time and it’s important to be patient and supportive throughout the process. In conclusion, discussing your husband’s drinking problem can be challenging, but it’s an important step in helping him get the help he needs. By approaching him with compassion, avoiding blame and demands, and giving him the time and space to process his decision, you can create a productive and supportive conversation that can lead to positive change."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: The 2016 MBC Entertainment Awards () presented by Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), took place on December 29, 2016 at MBC Public Hall in Sangamdong, Mapogu, Seoul.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Several major airports in the United States have experienced significant delays on numerous flights, causing frustration and inconvenience for passengers traveling on Monday. New York's JFK Airport has been hit particularly hard, with wait times exceeding two hours on 56 flights while passengers on 14 flights had to wait more than three hours. Meanwhile, Miami International saw delays of more than two hours on 51 flights. The reasons behind the delays are not clear, but it is believed that the bad weather conditions, security checks, and an increase in the number of people traveling for the winter holidays may have contributed to the situation. Passengers took to social media to share their frustration and anger, with many expressing disappointment at the lack of communication from airlines and airport staff regarding the cause of the delays. Traveling can already be a stressful experience, but long delays can quickly turn it into a nightmare. In addition to the inconvenience, these delays can also have financial consequences for passengers who may miss connecting flights or business meetings. As a result, airlines and airport authorities need to take steps to ensure that passengers are informed of the reasons behind the delays and are assisted as much as possible. While JFK and Miami International were the hardest hit, other airports including LAX and O'Hare International in Chicago have also experienced delays. As such, passengers need to remain vigilant and keep track of any updates from their airlines or airport authorities. In conclusion, the recent delays at major US airports highlight the importance of communication and assistance for passengers during such situations. It is important for airlines and airports to work together to minimize the impact of delays on passengers and to ensure that they are kept informed and supported throughout the journey."},{"instruction":"gigondas sur table it was jeanchristian's wife laura and the winemaker since 2013 beatrice jean who served the wines Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"At Gigondas sur Table, it was Jean-Christian's wife Laura and the winemaker since 2013, Beatrice Jean, who served the wines."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

All you need is a few basic supplies and a little bit of patience, and you can create your own beautiful and unique wrist accessory. Here is a simple step-by-step guide to making a cord bracelet. First, gather your supplies. You will need a length of cord, scissors, and a ruler or tape measure. Fold your cord in half and tie a knot at the folded end. This will create a loop that you will use to fasten the bracelet later. Measure the length of the bracelet by wrapping the cord around your wrist and adding an extra inch or two for the knot and fastening loop. Turn the bracelet so that the loop is at the top, and the two loose strands are hanging down. Take the left strand and pull it around the right side of the bracelet, weaving it in and out of the other strand as you go. Once you reach the end of the bracelet, take the loose right strand and weave it in and out of the left strand. Pull the right strand up through the left loop, and tighten up the knot by pulling on both strands. Repeat this weaving and knotting process all the way to the other end of the bracelet. Once you reach the end, tie a final knot to secure the bracelet. Finally, trim off any excess cord with scissors, and your bracelet is ready to wear. That's it! With just a few simple steps, you can create a beautiful and unique cord bracelet that is perfect for any occasion. Experiment with different colors and cord types to create a variety of bracelets to match any outfit or mood. Happy crafting!"},{"instruction":"Solve 89*z + 478*z + 603*z = 49600 for z..

The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygendependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.

Even as the iPad was flying off shelves in 2010, his children weren't allowed to have one.","output":"In today's world, digital devices are a ubiquitous aspect of modern life. From smartphones to tablets, people of all ages are using digital technologies. However, some notable figures have recognized the potential downsides of unrestricted device usage, even for young children. One famous example is Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Despite his professional involvement in the development of devices like the iPad, Jobs and his wife, Laurene Powell, were quite strict about screen time for their children. Erin and Eve, their two daughters, didn't get to use digital devices much despite the release of the iPad in 2010. This decision reflects a growing concern among parents and educators about the effects of too much screen time on children. Some studies have suggested that excessive screen time can lead to issues such as attention problems, sleep disturbances, and delayed language development. Too much screen time may also negatively impact children's social and emotional well-being, as well as their physical health. While many parents feel pressure to give their children access to the latest digital devices, it's worth considering the potential long-term impact of such decisions. In recent years, some experts have suggested guidelines for healthy device usage, such as limiting screen time to certain hours of the day or setting aside specific times for device-free activities. Ultimately, it's up to individual families to make decisions about device usage that work best for them. However, the example of Steve Jobs and his family serves as a reminder that it's important to be mindful about the role of digital devices in our lives, particularly when it comes to young children who may be especially vulnerable to their effects."},{"instruction":"Sentence: The Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport is in Paracuellos de Jarama.

Vincent I, on the other hand, died on September 13, 1822, at the age of 55. Therefore, it is evident that Vincent I died before Francis IV. Francis IV was the last Duke of Modena and Reggio, and his reign was characterized by political upheavals and economic struggles. He is remembered for being a patron of the arts and sciences, despite the challenges facing his administration. Vincent I, on the other hand, was a ruler of Portugal and the Algarves during the early 19th century. He was known for his efforts to modernize the country and improve its economy. However, his reign was short-lived, and he died before he could realize many of his goals for the country. In conclusion, historical evidence shows that Vincent I died before Francis IV.

Customs found £674,920 at London City Airport in 2009. More than £400k was in used notes bundled in elastic bands, court heard. Judge ordered it be forfeited as 'proceeds of criminal activity' Dr Wiese now appealing to High Court over claims there is 'no evidence' of wrongdoing.","output":"Christoffel Hendrik Wiese, a South African businessman, is currently appealing to the High Court to return a stash of money that was seized at London City Airport by customs officials in 2009. The money, totaling £674,920, was discovered by customs officials who found that more than £400k was bundled in elastic bands and in used notes. However, in 2017, a judge ordered that the money be forfeited as \\"proceeds of criminal activity\\". Wiese is now appealing this decision, claiming that there is \\"no evidence\\" of wrongdoing and that the money is entirely legitimate. The case raises questions surrounding the accountability and transparency of law enforcement officials when it comes to seizing large sums of money. In many cases, individuals whose money is seized have little recourse to challenge the decision, leaving them in a difficult position. Wiese's case is particularly interesting because of the lack of evidence of wrongdoing. While it is possible that the money could have been obtained through illegal means, the fact that no evidence has been presented is troubling. Without a strong body of evidence to support the forfeiture of the money, it raises the question of whether the decision was based on assumptions rather than facts. This case also highlights the importance of due process and the need for officials to follow proper procedures when seizing assets. If there is evidence of criminal activity, then it is important that the individuals responsible are held accountable. However, if there is no evidence, then it is equally important that the money is returned to its rightful owner. Overall, the outcome of Wiese's appeal will have important implications for future cases involving the seizure of assets. It is imperative that officials act in a transparent and fair manner, with strong evidence to support their decisions. Failure to do so will erode trust in law enforcement and undermine the rule of law."},{"instruction":"Portugal: Portugal (Portuguese: [puɾtuˈɣaɫ]), officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: República Portuguesa), is a country on the Iberian Peninsula, in Southwestern Europe.

One theory is that the calendar came from mathematical operations based on the numbers thirteen and twenty, which were important numbers to the Maya. The numbers multiplied together equal 260. Another theory is that the 260day period came from the length of human pregnancy. This is close to the average number of days between the first missed menstrual period and birth, unlike Naegele's rule which is 40 weeks between the last menstrual period and birth. It is postulated that midwives originally developed the calendar to predict babies' expected birth dates. A third theory comes from understanding of astronomy, geography and paleontology. The mesoamerican calendar probably originated with the Olmecs, and a settlement existed at Izapa, in southeast Chiapas Mexico, before 1200 BCE.

However, Hubbard and Kelley have their sights set on something different: collaborating with rappers Lil Wayne or Wiz Khalifa. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Hubbard and Kelley shared their desire to push boundaries and break down barriers in the music industry. \\"Music evolves, and we like to be on the cutting edge,\\" says Hubbard. They recognize that country music, much like any other genre, must adapt and change with the times in order to remain relevant. Their desire to collaborate with rappers is not entirely surprising, considering the popularity of country-rap crossovers such as \\"Old Town Road\\" by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus.

Their latest album, Can't Say I Ain't Country, features a range of musical styles, from the traditional country twang of \\"Women\\" to the hip-hop infused beats of \\"Colorado.\\" This willingness to experiment has earned the duo both praise and criticism, with some traditional country fans accusing them of straying too far from the genre's roots. But Florida Georgia Line remains undeterred, continuing to push boundaries and experiment with new sounds. In their own words, they are simply \\"having fun making music and letting the fans be the judge.\\" As the country music industry continues to evolve and transform, it's clear that Florida Georgia Line will play a significant role in shaping its future.

Don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews. My reaction to it was that it is entertaining, well acted (for the most part), has some very witty dialogue, and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer Jean Lafitte. While not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), I feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role Lafitte played in New Orleans' history, and the lovehate relationship between the respectable citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. Don't worry about what the film doesn't do, but watch it for what it does do, i.e., for its study of one of New Orleans', and America's, most intriguing historical figures.

It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be unoriginal, hence establishing a critical text, or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both external evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and internal or physical considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).

Two years later, he saved the French government from collapse by firing on the Parisian mobs with cannons. The Directory rewarded Napoleon by giving him command of the Army of Italy at age 26, when he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring a series of decisive victories that made him famous all across Europe. He followed the defeat of the Allies in Europe by commanding a military expedition to Egypt in 1798, invading and occupying the Ottoman province after defeating the Mamelukes and launching modern Egyptology through the discoveries made by his army.

Pencils, pens, charcoal, appropriate paper, drawing stumps, and erasers are a few of the essentials that can help you create the artwork you envision. Pencils are one of the most basic drawing tools, but they are also one of the most versatile. There are different types of pencils available, ranging from hard to soft lead. If you want to create light and airy sketches, a hard-lead pencil may be the right choice. For bolder and darker strokes, a soft-lead pencil is best. Experiment with different leads and find out what works best for you. Pens are also useful for drawing, especially when you want to create sharp, precise lines. There are a variety of pens available, including fine point pens for detailed work, and brush pens for a more expressive style. Having a few pens on hand can help you create different effects in your drawing. Charcoal is another drawing tool that can create a unique look in your artwork. It's great for creating dramatic effects, but it can be messy. Make sure to work on an appropriate surface and have a clean workspace when using charcoal. Choosing the right paper is also important for effective drawing. Different types of paper have different textures and weights, which can affect how your artwork turns out. For example, smooth paper works well with pens, while textured paper is good for charcoal drawings. Experiment with different paper types and find out what works best for the type of artwork you're creating. A drawing stump is a tool that can help you blend and soften your drawings. It's useful for creating smooth transitions between different tones in your artwork. With a little bit of practice, a drawing stump can help you achieve a more professional look in your artwork. Finally, having an eraser on hand is crucial for correcting mistakes and tweaking details in your drawing. Make sure to use a high-quality eraser, as some erasers can damage your paper or smudge your artwork. In conclusion, by making use of pencils, pens, charcoal, appropriate paper, drawing stumps, and erasers, you can achieve great results in your artwork. With practice and experimentation, you can develop your own unique style and technique as an artist."},{"instruction":"Data: Aaron Deer, genre, Indie rock; Indie rock, stylisticOrigin, Garage rock; Aaron Deer, instrument, Keyboard instrument Sentence about the following d","output":"Aaron Deer is an indie rock musician who plays keyboard and incorporates elements of garage rock into his style."},{"instruction":"Review: is an actress works as well as it does because ( the leads ) are such a companionable couple Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

However, it's worth recognizing that titles are just as important as the body of the content itself. A compelling title can grab the reader's attention and encourage them to click or read on, while a poor title can cause readers to lose interest before they've even begun. One essential tip for crafting the right title is to keep a list of potential titles. Brainstorming a wide range of ideas can help you compare and contrast different titles and find the one that best fits your content's tone, voice, and purpose. Don't be afraid to recruit help. Asking colleagues or friends for their input can help you get a fresh perspective on your titles while providing valuable feedback on which ones are the most appealing. Finally, reserve several titles. Sometimes, what might seem like a fantastic title initially can lose its luster over time. By reserving several titles, you can ensure that you have backup options if your first choice doesn't feel appropriate further down the line. In conclusion, while it's easy to focus on the meat of your content, don't overlook the importance of crafting the perfect title.

Make corrections for index error, dip, refraction, semidiameter, and parallax. Add or subtract the declination of the sun to find your latitude.","output":"To accurately find your latitude using the sun’s position, you need to take into account various corrections. First, determine the sun’s angle of elevation at its highest point. This can be done using a sextant or an astrolabe. However, the instrument you use must be adjusted for index error, which can cause inaccuracies in your measurement. Next, you need to correct for dip. Dip is caused by the curvature of the Earth and affects the positioning of the sun as seen from your location. The amount of dip correction needed depends on the height of your observation point above sea level. Refraction also affects the position of the sun, causing it to appear higher than it actually is. This is because the Earth’s atmosphere bends the sun’s light as it travels towards us. A correction can be applied to account for refraction. The sun’s semi-diameter also needs to be taken into consideration. This is the angle that represents the size of the sun’s disk. Although small, it can affect your measurement when using an instrument such as a sextant. Finally, parallax correction is needed to account for the fact that the sun’s position appears to shift slightly as you move closer or further away from it. This correction is only necessary when using an instrument with a telescope. Once you have made all the necessary corrections, you can add or subtract the declination of the sun to determine your latitude. Declination is the angular distance between the sun and the celestial equator, which changes throughout the year. Tables and charts are available to help determine the declination for a specific date. In conclusion, finding your latitude using the sun's position requires a precise measurement and the application of various corrections.
