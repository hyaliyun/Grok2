The snacks were marketed as a healthier alternative to regular dog treats, but animal rights activists were quick to condemn the practice. The firm received numerous calls to stop the sale of the products, with many countries having banned the hunting of whales altogether. Consequently, the Japanese firm made a prudent decision to stop the selling of whale snacks after a public outcry. It was a commendable decision, especially considering the growing trend of eco-friendliness and animal rights advocacy. The firm, however, continues to sell dog snacks made from other unconventional meats such as kangaroo and Mongolian horse. While these meats may not be considered taboo in some cultures, it still raises ethical questions about the use of exotic animals for pet food. In conclusion, the decision of the Japanese firm to discontinue the sale of fin whale snacks is a step in the right direction.

And it seems that the wait may soon be over, as leaked photos and videos began circulating late last year. However, a recent eBay listing has provided what could be the strongest indication yet that the new device, believed to be named the HTC One M8, is soon to arrive. Listed for sale in the US earlier this week, the handset shown in the photos was branded as the HTC One. However, the specifications detailed in the description box were consistent with other leaked reports about the HTC One M8, including a 5-inch 1080p screen and a 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor. Perhaps most intriguingly, the phone was sold for 499.99 (£301) by a seller based in New York. While it's not unusual for pre-release devices to be sold in this way, it is rare for them to be revealed so close to an official release. With a launch event scheduled for next week, it appears that HTC fans and smartphone enthusiasts alike will soon have their first chance to see the new device in action.

Midwest and Eastern states received less critical habitat, primarily on rivers and coastlines. As of December, 2006, the Reagan regulation has not yet been replaced though its use has been suspended.

Many placenames in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the West Saxon dialect, away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects.

If you live in such an area, it's important to be proactive and prepared when it comes to hurricane season. Here are some things to keep in mind: Consider buying a generator: When a hurricane hits, power is often one of the first things to go. A generator can keep your house running even when the electricity goes out. Make sure you buy a generator with enough power for your needs and that you store enough fuel to keep it going for several days. Buy self-powered radios and flashlights: Communication is key during a hurricane, and a self-powered radio can help you stay on top of evacuation orders and weather warnings. Make sure to stock up on batteries for your flashlights as well. Add a “safe room” to your house if you can: A safe room is a designated space in your home where you can ride out the storm in relative safety. Ideally, it should have no windows and be reinforced with concrete or steel. Secure your property well in advance: Make sure your property is cleared of any debris that could be picked up by strong winds and used as a projectile. Trim back any trees that could fall onto your home during the storm, and cover windows with storm shutters or plywood. Reinforce your home during a watch or warning: In the lead-up to a hurricane, pay attention to local weather reports and take steps to reinforce your home. For example, you can reinforce your roof with hurricane straps or install impact-resistant windows. Stock up on food and water: When a hurricane hits, it may be days before help arrives. Make sure you have enough non-perishable food and water to sustain yourself and your family for at least three days. Don't forget to include a manual can opener and any necessary medications. By taking these steps, you can ensure that you and your family are as prepared as possible for any hurricane that comes your way. Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: What disease is associated with hydrophobia?

For example, squats are great for toning your glutes, while lunges can help shape and define your legs. Be sure to research which exercises will be most effective for your individual needs. Using proper form while exercising is crucial. Not only will it prevent injury, but also help you achieve maximum results. If you are unsure about proper form for a specific exercise, ask a trainer or do some research online. Finally, don't rest at your machine. Instead, take advantage of rest periods to do some stretching or other exercises that target different muscle groups. This will help you get maximum results from every workout. In conclusion, by following these simple guidelines, you can make the most of your time at the gym and achieve the results you desire. So dress comfortably, use sweat-absorbing accessories, keep good gym hygiene, make the most of your stretches, set achievable goals, know which exercises flatter specific body parts, use proper form, and don't rest at your machine!"},{"instruction":"CiscoBorderlessNetworksisbuiltonanarchitectureconsistingofwirelesssystems,routers,switches,security,WANaccelerationandmanagementsystemsmm.Theproductlinewasdevelopedtomeettheincreasingperformancerequirementsfor–amongotherthings–streamingvideo,wirelessnetworking,cloudandvirtualizationservicesandthegrowinguseofsmartphonesandotherdevicesintheworkplace.

Estrada spoke of the moment he returned to find Figoski unresponsive and on a stretcher.","output":"Glenn Estrada's Heroic Pursuit for Justice In December of 2011, Glenn Estrada was working as a police officer when he received a call about a robbery in progress. Without hesitation, he answered the call, not knowing that it was going to be a defining moment in his career as a police officer. The robbery had gone terribly wrong, and before Estrada arrived on the scene, Lamont Pride had brutally murdered his colleague, Peter Figoski. Estrada soon found himself in a high-speed pursuit of the perpetrator. Running through the dark city streets and alleyways, Estrada chased Pride with all his might, determined to catch the killer of his fellow officer. Despite the danger and obstacles, Estrada kept his resolve, knowing that Pride had to be caught and brought to justice. The chase continued until Pride was finally captured and arrested with Estrada's help. In an emotional interview, Estrada spoke about the moment he returned to the scene of the crime, where his colleague Figoski lay unresponsive and on a stretcher. He recalled the sense of duty and responsibility he felt, not only to his colleague but also to the community he served. Estrada's unwavering commitment to serve and protect was evident from the beginning of the chase to the capture of the suspect. Estrada's bravery and vigilance in the face of danger are a testament to the selflessness and sacrifice of police officers around the world. As society faces ongoing scrutiny of law enforcement, it is important to remember the risks and sacrifices that police make every day to protect their communities. Estrada's story is a true example of the bravery that defines the thin blue line protecting our society. In conclusion, Glenn Estrada's actions serve as an inspiration for all law enforcement officers to always remain vigilant, determined and committed to the cause of justice. His bravery should serve as an example not only to his colleagues but also to the society they serve.

Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue (as modeled in the luminosity function). Due to the simplicity of manufacturing the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making highintensity white LEDs. The design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex RGB system, and the majority of highintensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.

Take proper pain medication. Eat soft foods. Avoid smoking. See your oral surgeon with any problems.","output":"After undergoing a tooth extraction procedure, it is essential to take it easy to ensure a speedy and healthy recovery. The first order of business is to control bleeding. Your dentist will place a gauze pad at the extraction site, which you should bite down on carefully. Doing so will help create a blood clot, which is crucial for healing. To ensure a smooth recovery, it is essential to avoid any strenuous activities that could cause the clot to dislodge. This includes physical exercise, heavy lifting, and anything else that could raise your blood pressure. Minimizing any movement or activity will help promote healing. Keeping the wound clean is also critical. You can gently rinse your mouth with saltwater to help keep the area clean and reduce the risk of infection. It is best to avoid using mouthwash or brushing the extraction site for at least 24 hours following the procedure. If you experience any swelling, you can apply an ice pack to the affected area for ten to fifteen minutes at a time. In terms of pain management, your dentist may prescribe the appropriate pain medication or suggest over-the-counter options. Make sure you take the recommended dose at the proper intervals to manage your pain effectively. Eating soft foods such as soup or pudding can help avoid putting any undue pressure on the extraction site. Hard, crunchy, or chewy foods can dislodge the clot and impede the healing process. Another critical step in promoting a healthy recovery is to avoid smoking or using tobacco products of any kind. Smoking can delay the healing process and increase the risk of infection. Finally, if you experience any unusual symptoms, pain, or bleeding after your tooth extraction, make sure to contact your oral surgeon immediately. They will be able to assess your condition and take the appropriate steps to address any problems that may arise. In summary, following these tips will help promote a successful and speedy recovery following a tooth extraction procedure. Remember to take it easy, control bleeding with gauze, clean the wound with salt water, take pain medication as prescribed, eat soft foods, avoid smoking, and reach out to your oral surgeon with any concerns."},{"instruction":"Math Problem Solve 217*i 212*i + 2070 = 176*i + 18 for i.","output":"To solve for i, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

Bring the ridge edges together with a ridgecapping layer.","output":"Properly Installing Shingles on Your Roof Installing shingles on a roof may seem like a daunting task, but it can actually be quite simple if you follow the correct steps. One of the most important steps is sizing your shingles appropriately. Make sure to purchase shingles that are the correct size for your roof to ensure that they will properly adhere and not be prone to wind damage. Once you have your shingles, the first step in the installation process is to lay a starting row at the bottom of the roof along the edge. This row should be narrow, acting as a foundation for the rest of the shingles to be layered on. The first row of shingles should be laid directly above the narrow starter row, ensuring that they are covering it completely. After the first row is secure, it's time to lay the second row of shingles. Make sure to align the second row with the first, ensuring that they are straight and even. Continue to lay row after row of shingles until you reach the top of your roof. As you make your way up the roof, you'll come across stacks, vents, and chimneys that require special attention. When shingling around these obstacles, take care to fit the shingles around them as necessary. If you come across a chimney, be sure to interlace the flashing around it with the rows of shingles to prevent any water from seeping in. Finally, once you've laid all of your shingles, it's time to finish off the roofing. Bring the ridge edges together with a ridge-capping layer, which acts as a final seal to keep your roof protected from the elements. In conclusion, installing shingles on your roof can seem overwhelming, but if you follow these simple steps, it can be a breeze. Properly sizing your shingles, laying a starting row, shingling around obstacles, and adding a ridge-capping layer will all contribute to a strong, long-lasting roof."},{"instruction":"ere is a goal: Add barf bag to car.

These particular pants look to be custommade, suggesting that people had been practicing the art of pantsmaking for a while, notes Phys.org. Rather than the modern method of cutting down large pieces of fabric, the early pants were woven on a loom in preciselysized segments to form the final garment, like nomad couture, explains Time.

The search for a job in Norway can be carried out through various mediums such as job portals, social media and recruitment agencies. It is important to note that Norway is a country with a strong job market, but competition for positions can be high. Therefore, it is necessary to tailor the job search to the desired industry, update the resume and ensure it is in Norwegian as well as English, which is the common language used in the workforce in Norway. When a suitable job position is identified and applied for, the next step is applying for a residence permit. Norway has various types of permits, depending on work, study, and residency purposes. The application process for a residence permit can be initiated online or through the Norwegian embassy or consulate in the applicant's home country. The process may be lengthy, as the applicant may need to gather documents such as certificates, official identification documents, and proof of financial support. A successful application will allow the applicant to stay in Norway legally for up to two years. Once the residence permit has been secured, the next step is preparing for travel to Norway. Obtaining health insurance and possibly securing housing should be done before departure.

The loss of Mr. Newmark as Minister for Civil Society is a particular blow, given his important role in overseeing charities and volunteering initiatives across the UK.

In April 2010, the unemployment rate was 9.9%, one of the highest rates ever recorded in the history of the U.S. economy. However, by March 2018, the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.1%. This indicates a substantial improvement of 5.8% over the eight-year period. To understand this improvement, it is essential to look at some of the factors that contributed to the decline in unemployment. One significant factor was the steady economic growth that occurred during the period. As the U.S. economy grew, more job opportunities were created, and more people were able to secure employment. Another contributing factor was the government's stimulus package, which helped to boost the economy and increase employment opportunities. Additionally, there were improvements in the housing market, which helped to stabilize the economy and create more jobs. As the economy improved, more people entered the workforce, which helped to reduce the unemployment rate. This reduction in the unemployment rate has contributed to an overall improvement in the U.S. economy and has had a positive impact on the lives of many Americans. In conclusion, the U.S. unemployment rate improved by 5.8% from April 2010 to March 2018. This was due to various factors, including economic growth, government stimulus packages, and improvements in the housing market. While there is still work to be done to improve the job market, this improvement is a positive sign for the U.S. economy and its citizens."},{"instruction":"Article: The history of science is the study of the development of science and scientific knowledge, including both the natural sciences and social sciences.

His portrayal of Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett in the World War II drama was particularly memorable, showcasing his acting abilities and cementing his status as a Hollywood icon.

He received countless accolades for his work, including two Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture for the film, Gandhi.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In August 2012, an incredible milestone was reached in space exploration: Voyager 1 left the heliosphere, becoming the first man-made object to enter interstellar space. This momentous occasion was a result of decades of hard work by NASA and its team of engineers and scientists. The Voyager mission began in 1977 when Voyager 1 and 2 were launched into space, 16 days apart. The mission's goal was to explore the outer planets of our solar system, providing detailed information on each planet and their moons. Over the years, the Voyager probes sent back a wealth of data, including images of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which have helped us understand our solar system better. However, as the Voyager probes continued their journey, they reached the limits of their primary mission - the outer planets - and NASA extended their mission into interstellar space. Interstellar space is the region between the stars and is where the Voyager probes currently reside. Voyager 1's departure from the heliosphere is a significant milestone in space exploration, a testament to NASA's ingenuity and tenacity. The heliosphere is a bubble-like region surrounding the sun and planets, created by the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that flows from the sun. By leaving the heliosphere, Voyager 1 has entered a new region of space, where the solar wind no longer dominates, and the interstellar medium prevails. Voyager 1's departure from the heliosphere has enabled scientists to study the interstellar medium, providing valuable information about the nature of space outside our solar system. The Voyager mission has already provided us with a wealth of data, including the first measurements of the density of interstellar plasma and revealing the existence of an unexpected magnetic highway at the edge of our solar system. It's essential to note that Voyager 1 is still operational, more than four decades after its launch. The probe continues to beam back data, and scientists believe that it will keep doing so until 2025. The data Voyager 1 has provided us with over the years has helped us understand our solar system better and will continue to shape our understanding of space in the years to come. In conclusion, Voyager 1's departure from the heliosphere in August 2012 is a testament to the hard work and dedication of NASA's team of engineers and scientists. The Voyager mission has provided us with a wealth of data, enabling us to better understand our solar system and the space beyond.

In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in smallworld networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method. Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the footandmouth virus in 2001.

However, according to statistical analysis, the average length of a touchdown in the National Football League (NFL) is around 30 yards. This number is arrived at by analyzing data from the past several NFL seasons. During this time, every touchdown scored was recorded, and the yards needed to reach the end zone were measured for each one. By taking the sum total of all yards gained and dividing that by the total number of touchdowns scored, an average distance of 30 yards was determined. It's essential to note that this is just an average, and there are plenty of touchdowns that occur at lengths significantly different from this. Sometimes a touchdown can be scored from just a few yards away from the end zone, while other times, it may require a player to run the entire field for a 100-yard touchdown. Historically, the average length of a touchdown has fluctuated over time, with variations according to different eras of the game's evolution. During the early years of professional football, running the ball was the primary offensive strategy, leading to a higher average length for touchdowns. As the game has evolved, however, teams rely more on passing, leading to shorter touchdown distances. Conclusion In summary, the average length of a touchdown in the NFL is around 30 yards. While there are plenty of touchdowns scored at different lengths than this, analyzing data from recent years has allowed this number to be established as a reliable and accurate average."},{"instruction":"Solve 5*h = 23*h + 18 for h..

However, it is essential to minimize the importance of these negative responses and not let them hold us back. One way to do this is to develop a fear of regret. By viewing the potential regret of not pursuing something as far more significant than the potential temporary discomfort of rejection, we shift our focus from the negative response to the positive outcome we could achieve. Furthermore, it is essential to challenge oneself and actively seek out rejection. This may seem counterintuitive, but the more we expose ourselves to rejection, the more comfortable we become with it. By doing so, we can learn to accept and even embrace rejection, recognizing that it is an inevitable and valuable part of the process. Finally, when faced with rejection, it is essential to maintain a positive attitude and even laugh about it. Laughter is a powerful tool that can help us alleviate stress, diffuse tension, and maintain a resilient mindset. By embracing rejection with humor and not taking it too seriously, we can bounce back quickly and continue pursuing our goals with renewed motivation and vigor. In conclusion, minimizing the importance of negative responses, developing a fear of regret, and learning to embrace rejection with a positive attitude and humor can help us overcome obstacles, maintain our confidence, and achieve our goals."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

When transplanting a young tree, use a pair of hand pruners to snip away smaller lower hanging branches. Pruning young trees helps the root system take hold and promotes growth of their crown, or the top of the tree. Use hand pruners and snip any smaller branches growing inward towards the leader. These branches rub against the tree as they grow and will damage it over time. Branches growing towards the leader don’t get enough sunlight to stay healthy. For young trees, it’s best if their branches are spaced 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) apart from each other. Overpruning can damage the tree, so make sure that you leave at least 2/3rds of the branches each time you prune it. Pruning outgrowing branches should start as soon as you plant the tree. This will keep it aesthetically pleasing and promotes healthy growth. Cutting the leader when the tree is young will inhibit the tree’s growth.

Out of the 53 players on the Titans' roster in 2020, only one player did not catch a pass from Tannehill. That player was offensive lineman David Quessenberry. Quessenberry, who primarily played as a tackle, was not utilized as a receiver in the passing game. All other offensive players on the Titans' roster caught at least one pass from Tannehill. The leading receiver was A.J. Brown, who caught 70 passes for 1,075 yards and 11 touchdowns. Tight end Jonnu Smith also had a productive season, catching 41 passes for 448 yards and eight touchdowns. Other notable receivers included Corey Davis, Adam Humphries, and Derrick Henry, who caught two touchdown passes out of the backfield. Tannehill's success in the passing game was due in part to his strong connection with his receivers. He developed a rapport with Brown, in particular, as the two connected for several long touchdowns throughout the season. Tannehill's ability to spread the ball around to different receivers kept opposing defenses on their toes and opened up other areas of the field for the Titans' offense to exploit. In conclusion, every offensive player on the Titans' roster caught at least one pass from Ryan Tannehill last season, except for David Quessenberry. Tannehill's success in the passing game was due in part to his ability to connect with a variety of receivers, including A.J. Brown, Jonnu Smith, and Corey Davis."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: My striped sailor dress is also a piece I wear for days when my mood and confidence needs a boost It fits perfectly its nice and vintagy plus it draws compliments from everyone","output":"\\"My striped sailor dress is also a piece I wear for days when my mood and confidence needs a boost.

The Reds will be hoping to bounce back from their disappointing 3-0 defeat to Real Madrid in midweek and secure a crucial three points against a struggling QPR side. One of the most talked-about players in the Liverpool squad ahead of this game is Italian striker Mario Balotelli. Balotelli has only scored once in his eight appearances for the Reds so far this season, leading to criticism from the club's manager Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers has stated that Balotelli needs to improve his goal-scoring record if he is to be a success at Anfield. However, Balotelli has responded to this criticism by stating that his only objective at the moment is to score his first Premier League goal for the club. The Italian international has struggled to adapt to Rodgers' system and has often found himself isolated up front, but he will be hoping to play a key role against QPR. Liverpool will also be boosted by the return of Daniel Sturridge, who is expected to be named in the squad after recovering from injury. Sturridge was one of Liverpool's standout players last season, scoring 21 goals in his debut campaign at the club, and his return will provide a much-needed boost for the Reds. QPR, on the other hand, have struggled to find form this season and have only won one of their first nine games. The Hoops will be hoping to cause an upset against Liverpool, but they will need to improve their performances if they are to secure a positive result. Overall, Sunday's game promises to be an exciting affair between two teams who both need to pick up points. Liverpool will be hoping to build on their recent league victory against Hull, while QPR will be desperate for a win to ease their relegation fears. With the likes of Balotelli and Sturridge in their ranks, Liverpool will be confident of securing three points, but QPR will be eager to spoil their party."},{"instruction":"• myth: you cannot really grow without the use of human growth hormone (hgh).

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. No evidence has yet been found of a Jewish presence in antiquity in Germany beyond its Roman border, nor in Eastern Europe. In Gaul and Germany itself, with the possible exception of Trier and Cologne, the archeological evidence suggests at most a fleeting presence of very few Jews, primarily itinerant traders or artisans. A substantial Jewish population emerged in northern Gaul by the Middle Ages, but Jewish communities existed in 465 CE in Brittany, in 524 CE in Valence, and in 533 CE in Orleans. Throughout this period and into the early Middle Ages, some Jews assimilated into the dominant Greek and Latin cultures, mostly through conversion to Christianity.[better source needed] King Dagobert I of the Franks expelled the Jews from his Merovingian kingdom in 629.

Thus, there cannot be a definite answer to whether the Colts or the Broncos scored more points without specifying the game or season in question. However, it is possible to compare their overall performance in terms of points scored in different seasons or historical records. In the 2020 NFL season, the Colts and Broncos played against each other in Week 8, resulting in a 31-27 victory for the Broncos. In that game, the Broncos scored a total of 31 points, while the Colts scored 27 points. Therefore, in that game, the Broncos scored more points than the Colts. On the other hand, if we analyze the overall performance of the Colts and Broncos in the NFL since their establishment, we can see that the Colts have scored more points than the Broncos. As of the end of the 2020 season, the Colts have scored a total of 29,482 points in their history, whereas the Broncos have scored 25,013 points. This indicates that the Colts have historically scored more points than the Broncos. In conclusion, the answer to the question of who scored more points, Colts or Broncos, is subjective to the game or season being referred to.

This includes swimming pools, hot tubs, and even baths or showers. If you must bathe or shower, try to keep the piercing as dry as possible or cover it with a waterproof bandage. After cleaning the area with a saline solution recommended by your piercer, make sure to pat the area dry with a clean towel. Avoid rubbing the area, as this can cause irritation. It's also important to avoid using any creams, lotions, or oils on the area. These substances can trap moisture and lead to complications. If you're struggling to keep your piercing dry, consider using a protective covering such as a specialized wound dressing or even a piece of plastic wrap. Be sure to change the covering regularly to maintain cleanliness. Remember, proper aftercare is crucial for successful healing of any piercing.

I'm still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell portrays Elvis, right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face. Sometimes its scary how much he looks, acts, and talks like the real Elvis. Thankfully this is being released on DVD, so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film. I have heard the detractors, who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things left out, but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with, and that this was being shown on television (just two years after Elvis's death!) that he did a fine job with this.

Military says it conducted airstrikes based on intelligence on presence of militants. The militants were linked to planning the Karachi airport attack, military says.","output":"Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, has defended the recent military operations against militants near the Afghan border, citing failed talks as the reason for the military actions. The operations resulted in the deaths of seven Pakistani soldiers, highlighting the dangers of fighting against terrorist groups in the region. The military has stated that the airstrikes were conducted based on intelligence reports indicating the presence of militants who were linked to planning the Karachi airport attack. The importance of neutralizing these militants cannot be overstated, as their potential to carry out further attacks could result in the loss of innocent lives. The use of military force in the fight against terrorism is always a difficult decision to make, especially when it results in the loss of life. However, in this case, it appears that no other options were available. Talks with the militants had failed, and with their link to the Karachi airport attack, the risk was too great to allow them to continue unchecked. The situation in Pakistan highlights the continuing need for vigilance and decisive action against terrorist groups. The efforts made by the country's military in this latest operation are commendable, and we can only hope that it serves as a deterrent to other groups who seek to do harm. In conclusion, the recent military actions in Pakistan against the militants by the Pakistani army should be supported by all, as it reflects a strong determination to combat terrorism and protect the nation's citizens. While we mourn the loss of the Pakistani soldiers, their sacrifice will not be in vain if it helps to bring about an end to the senseless violence perpetrated by extremist groups."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"\\"A Quiet Place\\" is a suspenseful thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

In the National Football League (NFL), the second longest touchdown pass was thrown by Tom Brady on October 18, 2015, when he connected with Brandon LaFell for an 80-yard touchdown against the Indianapolis Colts. This was a significant moment in Brady's career, as he surpassed Hall of Famer Dan Marino for the most touchdown passes in NFL history. However, if we expand our search beyond the NFL, there are other quarterbacks who have thrown longer touchdown passes. In college football, the second longest touchdown pass was thrown by David Klingler of the University of Houston on September 11, 1990, when he connected with receiver Manny Hazard for a 95-yard touchdown against Southern Methodist University. In the Canadian Football League (CFL), the second longest touchdown pass was thrown by Kent Austin of the Saskatchewan Roughriders on October 8, 1989, when he connected with Jeff Fairholm for a 109-yard touchdown against the Edmonton Eskimos. It is worth noting that the CFL has a longer field than the NFL, which may explain the longer touchdown pass.
