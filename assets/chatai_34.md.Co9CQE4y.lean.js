Rushkoff: Users who don't want to depend on Twitter should explore and/or build alternatives.","output":"In a recent tweet, Douglas Rushkoff commented on the decision by Twitter to ban the access of a reporter who had been tweeting negative comments about NBC. Rushkoff pointed out that this decision should come as no surprise, as Twitter is a corporation with concerns that extend beyond its users. According to Rushkoff, Twitter's decision to ban the reporter's access sends a message to its corporate partners that they too can ask the company how to ban users who offend. This highlights the fact that Twitter, like many other social media companies, is ultimately more concerned with its bottom line than with the satisfaction of its users. For those who are unhappy with Twitter's policies or do not want to depend on the platform, Rushkoff has a simple solution: explore and/or build alternatives. With so many different social media platforms available, there is no reason to rely solely on Twitter or any other single platform. By experimenting with different sites or even creating their own, users can regain a sense of control over their online presence and avoid being subject to the whims of corporate interests. In the end, Rushkoff's message is clear: while Twitter and other social media companies may provide a useful service, they are ultimately beholden to their shareholders and should not be trusted to act in the best interests of their users. By exploring alternatives and thinking outside the box, users can take control of their online experience and create a more satisfying, fulfilling social media presence."},{"instruction":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: 15:10ButbythegraceofGodIamwhatIam:andhisgracewhichwasbestoweduponmewasnotinvain;butIlabouredmoreabundantlythantheyall:yetnotI,butthegraceofGodwhichwaswithme.","output":"15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."},{"instruction":"~I've been so busy at work ever since vacation ended that in the evenings I ' ve just sort of collapsed and done nothing .

Paint the baseboards Install the baseboards around the mirror using liquid nails. Secure the baseboards with painter's tape or lay the mirror on the ground. Let the frame dry completely for 24 hours. Fill any gaps in the corners with caulk and paint over it.","output":"If you're looking to upgrade a plain mirror, framing it will instantly add a touch of elegance and polish to any room. Luckily, framing a mirror can be an easy and affordable task, thanks to the use of primed MDF baseboards and a few simple tools. The first step is to measure the dimensions of the mirror to figure out how much material you will need. Using a tape measure, take precise measurements of the length and width of the mirror. Make sure to take into account any beveled edges or irregularities. Next, head to your local home improvement store to purchase primed MDF baseboards. Make sure the baseboards are wide enough to cover the edges of the mirror and provide enough surface area to create a noticeable frame. The primed MDF baseboards are a great choice because they are easy to work with and already pre-primed, which will save time during the painting process. With the baseboards in hand, cut them to the appropriate length using a miter saw. A miter saw is the best tool for creating precise, angled cuts quickly and accurately. Remember to cut the corners of the baseboards to a 45-degree angle to create seamless joints. After cutting the baseboards, it's time to paint them. Choose a paint color that complements your room's decor or go for a classic white or black. Allow the baseboards to dry completely before installing them. To install the baseboards, use liquid nails to apply a thin layer of adhesive to the back of the baseboards. Carefully press the baseboards onto the mirror, making sure to align them to create even edges. You can secure the baseboards in place with painter's tape or lay the mirror on the ground while the adhesive dries. Once the adhesive has dried, which usually takes about 24 hours, inspect the corners to ensure there are no gaps. If gaps are present, use caulk to fill them in and paint over the caulk to make it blend with the rest of the frame. In conclusion, framing a mirror is an easy and budget-friendly way to transform a plain and ordinary mirror into a stylish and elegant piece. Follow these simple steps and take your decor to the next level."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude that Emma's place had been taken by an excellent woman as governess. if the statement Emma's mother had died long ago, and her place had been taken by an excellent woman as governess. is true?

This represents an increase of 6.8% from the previous year. On the other hand, the median income for males working full-time was 55,291 in the same year. This means that the median household income was 13,412 more than the median income for males working full-time. It's important to note that these figures are based on median values, which means that they represent the midpoint of the income distribution. Half of all households or males working full-time earn more than the median, while the other half earn less. Furthermore, there are different factors that can affect these income levels, including education, occupation, and location. For instance, individuals with higher levels of education tend to earn more than those with lower levels of education. Similarly, certain occupations and industries pay higher wages than others. Finally, the cost of living can also vary depending on where someone lives, which can influence their earning potential.

This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, the DNA repair mechanisms that normally revert mutations can introduce errors when repairing the physical damage to the molecule is more important than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing doublestrand breaks.:5.4 What can small mutations be caused by?

This event highlighted an unfortunate trend in the country, where many intellectuals assigned to work on big government projects succumb to stress-related illnesses. The landing exercise marked the debut of the jet, which was designed to carry missiles and precision-guided bombs. It was a major accomplishment for the engineering team, but also a bittersweet one. Yuan had been involved in the project for years and had poured his heart and soul into making it a success. Sadly, he did not live to see the impact of his hard work. Stress is a silent killer that can have devastating effects on a person's physical and mental health. This is especially true for intellectuals working on high-pressure government projects. The pressure to succeed, combined with long working hours and tight deadlines, can take a toll on even the strongest person. Unfortunately, the impact of stress is often overlooked until it's too late. The loss of Yuan is a tragic reminder of the toll stress can take on people's lives. It's important for employers to recognize the need for work-life balance and provide support for their employees. This can include mental health resources, flexible work schedules, and stress management training. It's also crucial for individuals to take care of themselves by prioritizing self-care and seeking help when needed. In conclusion, the success of the new fighter bomber was undoubtedly a great accomplishment for the engineering team, but it came at a heavy cost. The loss of Yuan is a stark reminder that stress is a serious issue that must be addressed to prevent further tragedies. Let's honor Yuan's legacy by taking steps to support the well-being of intellectuals working on big projects, and prioritize self-care in our own lives."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

The guide was started in 1936 by a Harlem mailman named Victor Green. Professor: It gives us a history of what we might call 'driving while black'","output":"The \\"Green Book\\" was a travel guide that proved instrumental for African-Americans navigating the United States during the dark era of segregation. Victor H. Green, a Harlem mailman, first published the guide in 1936. The book detailed places such as hotels, restaurants, and gas stations that were safe for African-Americans to visit on their travels. As Jim Crow laws enforced segregation across much of America, the Green Book provided a vital service to those in danger of harassment or danger when traveling. The Green Book served as a beacon of hope during tough times. Historians note that the book highlights the struggles that many African-Americans faced at the time when traveling across the country. It provides a glimpse into the way of life and the many challenges that travelers faced as they went through the country. The guide even had a section on how to deal with traffic enforcement personnel who had a reputation for targeting African-Americans unfairly. The Green Book was a lifeline for the African-American community helping them to navigate uncharted territories safely. Its publication ran through various editions, ending with the last issue in 1966/67. The Green Book has since become a symbol of the intolerance that plagued the country up until the modern era. The book lives on as a reminder of the harsh realities of racism and segregation. The significance of the Green Book has led a renewed appreciation for it today. Scholars and historians use the text as a crucial source of information on this dark chapter in American history. One professor noted the Green Book's significance, stating that \\"It gives us a history of what we might call 'driving while black'\\" and highlights the struggles many African-Americans faced during those times.

Hot water (known as liquor in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as grist) in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as sparging. This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium.

To determine the number of times the Dolphins have scored in a particular game, one must consult the game's statistics. These statistics can typically be found on various online platforms that cover football, including the official NFL website and sports news outlets. Once the statistics have been obtained, one can look at the scoring section to determine how many times the Dolphins scored in the game. This section usually lists the team's total number of points scored, as well as a breakdown of how those points were accumulated. For example, if the statistics show that the Dolphins scored a total of 28 points in a game, one can assume that they scored four touchdowns, as each touchdown is worth six points, and the remaining two points were earned either by a safety or a successful field goal attempt.

It also helps to unclog pores and reduce the chances of breakouts. Therefore, it is important to exfoliate regularly. Swimming in an indoor chlorinated pool can also aid in exfoliating the skin. The chlorine helps to remove dead skin cells, leaving the skin feeling smoother and softer. However, it is important to ensure that the skin is well moisturized as the chlorine can also dry out the skin. Hair removal cream is another way to keep the skin smooth and exfoliated. These creams dissolve hair from the surface of the skin, which also removes dead skin cells. It is important to test the cream on a small patch of skin before using it all over, to avoid any allergic reactions. Visiting the steam room is another method to exfoliate the skin. Steam helps to open up pores and loosen up the dirt and oil trapped inside. It also helps to improve circulation, which leads to healthier skin overall. Specific tan-removal products can also help to exfoliate and remove any unevenness caused by a bad tan. These products are specially formulated to target areas with excess pigment and to even out skin tone. Lastly, it is important to prevent blotchy tan the next time around. Some tips to avoid this include preparing the skin properly by exfoliating and moisturizing, using a self-tanner with a lighter shade, and applying the product evenly to avoid any patchiness. In conclusion, there are several ways to exfoliate and maintain healthy skin. Swimming in indoor chlorinated pools, using hair removal cream, visiting the steam room, using specific tan-removal products, and preventing blotchy tans can all help to keep the skin looking its best."},{"instruction":"8:52TheJewsthereforesaidtohim,Nowweknowthatthouhastademon.Abrahamhasdied,andtheprophets,andthousayest,Ifanyonekeepmyword,heshallnevertastedeath.

Reuse or conserve cooking water.","output":"Cooking is not only an art but also a science, especially when it comes to nutrition. Some foods are more nutritious when cooked, while others are best eaten raw. Therefore, understanding which foods are most nutritious when cooked and how to cook them can contribute significantly to your health. One essential tip for cooking nutritious food is to choose your cooking pots wisely. Different materials have different heat-conducting properties, which can affect the nutritional value of your food. For instance, stainless steel pots and pans are highly recommended as they retain the nutritional value of your food while being easy to clean. Another tip to keep in mind is that overcooking can destroy the nutrients in your food. Therefore, it's crucial to cook your food just right. Steaming is a great way to maintain the nutrient content of your food since it usually requires fewer cooking minutes than boiling, frying, or grilling. For example, steaming vegetables instead of boiling or frying them helps retain their essential nutrients like vitamin C, which can easily be lost in cooking water. Additionally, when cooking vegetables, adding some oil is highly recommended. Consuming fats with your vegetables is a great way to increase the uptake of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, present in some vegetables, like spinach and sweet potatoes. Finally, considering conserving the cooking water can be a great way to contribute to both your nutrition and the environment. For instance, reusing cooking water in soups or stews can help retain the nutrients from the vegetables you're cooking. In conclusion, cooking can be a fun and healthy activity if you do it right. By choosing the right cooking pots, not overcooking, steaming your food, adding oils to your vegetables, and conserving cooking water, you can enjoy both the taste and the nutritional benefits of your meals."},{"instruction":"Data: Akeem Ayers, formerTeam, New England Patriots; Akeem Ayers, debutTeam, Tennessee Titans Sentence about the following d","output":"Akeem Ayers debuted in the NFL with the Tennessee Titans and later played for the New England Patriots."},{"instruction":"@ClientA get well soon How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?

In 1913, the Italians had been defeated at the Action of Etangi but in 1914 Italian reinforcements led to a revival and by January the Senussi were in southeastern Cyrenaica. The Senussi had about 10,000 men armed with modern rifles, with ammunition from a factory which produced 1,000 rounds a day. Intermittent fighting continued between the Italians in fortified towns and the Senussi ranging through the desert. The British declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November and the leadership of the Ottoman Empire encouraged the Senussi to attack Egypt from the west.

Gabriele had been detained in 2012 for allegedly stealing confidential documents from the Pope's private apartment that were later leaked to the public. Gabriele claims that he copied the documents because of the troubling atmosphere within the Vatican. He maintains his innocence of theft but admits that he betrayed the trust of the Pope. The leaked documents were cited in a book alleging corruption within the church hierarchy. While Gabriele's story garnered international attention, the Vatican has denied mistreating the former butler. The incident sparked a larger conversation about transparency and corruption within the Vatican, leading to changes in Vatican procedures for handling confidential documents. Despite the controversy surrounding the leaked documents, many continue to view Gabriele as a hero for bringing potential corruption to light. However, it remains important to consider the gravity of stealing confidential documents and the consequences that come with such actions. Overall, the Vatican's rejection of Gabriele's claims sheds new light on the incident and highlights the importance of transparency within religious institutions.

Dorsett's run is legendary because it showcased his explosive speed and agility as he broke through the Vikings' defense and outran several defenders for the length of the field. The run was the longest in Cowboys' history, and it helped the team secure a 27-10 victory over the Vikings in the wild-card playoff round of the 1982 season. While Dorsett's record stands out, there have been many other impressive touchdown runs in football history, ranging from the gritty runs of legends like Walter Payton and Jim Brown to the breakaway speed of modern stars like Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson. Some records, like the longest run in college football history, are even longer than Dorsett's, with a 100-yard touchdown run being accomplished by several athletes.

Knowing how to disable your opponent quickly and efficiently could be the difference between life and death. In this article, we'll explore three simple techniques to disarm and drop an attacker. The first technique involves kicking the back or side of the knee to drop your opponent. This move is effective because it targets a vulnerable area of the leg, causing significant pain and loss of balance. To execute this move, position yourself behind your attacker and aim for the back or side of the knee. One swift kick is all it takes to bring them down. The second technique is the leg sweep. This technique is useful when your opponent is shorter than you, as it allows you to knock them down easily while maintaining your balance. To execute this move, position yourself in front of your attacker and sweep their legs with a swift motion. Remember to keep your balance and avoid getting caught off guard. The third and final technique involves disarming your attacker by gripping their wrist and bending it. This move is effective because it immobilizes the opponent's arm, making it difficult for them to use a weapon or continue to attack. To execute this move, quickly grip your opponent's wrist and apply pressure by bending it inwards. You can then use their arm to control them or even disarm them entirely. In conclusion, these three self-defense techniques can be extremely useful in protecting yourself from attackers. Always remember that the goal is to neutralize the situation as quickly and efficiently as possible. By practicing these techniques regularly, you can build confidence in your abilities and increase your chances of staying safe in potentially dangerous situations."},{"instruction":"As of the census of 2010, 295,803 people, 125,752 households, and 62,915 families resided in the city.

In their insensitive joke, the DJs pretended to be Gleason and asked to be \\"smothered.\\" The comment was met with widespread condemnation from the public and the media, and the three DJs were swiftly removed from their jobs. In a statement, Gleason accepted the apology from the DJs, saying he believes they are genuinely sorry for their actions.

Rack the wine again after two months. Rack the wine a third time. Rack the wine into bottles. Cork the bottles. Store or enjoy the watermelon wine.","output":"Making your own wine is a rewarding and enjoyable experience, and one type of wine that is particularly fun to try making is watermelon wine. While the process of making watermelon wine can be somewhat lengthy, the results are undoubtedly worth it. Once you have completed the initial step of fermenting the watermelon juice and adding in the necessary ingredients, such as yeast and sugar, it is time to rack the wine. Racking the wine is the process of siphoning the wine from one container to another, leaving the sediment behind. This step helps to clarify the wine and improve its flavor. For watermelon wine, it is recommended to rack the wine and leave it for three months after fermentation begins. This allows the wine to continue fermenting and improves the overall taste. After two months, it is time to rack the wine again. This step further clarifies the wine and helps to remove any remaining sediment. The final step in the racking process is to rack the wine a third time. This step ensures that the wine is as clear as possible before bottling. Once the wine has been racked for the third time, it is time to prepare the bottles. Make sure the bottles are clean and dry before racking the wine into them. After the wine has been racked into the bottles, it is time to cork them. Use wine corks and a corking tool to create a tight seal. Once the bottles are corked, it is recommended to store them in a cool, dark place for at least six months before enjoying. This allows the wine to age and develop its unique flavor. Alternatively, if you can't wait, you can drink the wine immediately after bottling. However, keep in mind that the taste may not be as developed as it would be after aging. In conclusion, the process of making watermelon wine requires some patience and attention to detail, but the end result is well worth the effort. By racking the wine at specific intervals and allowing it to age, you can create a delicious and unique homemade wine to enjoy with friends and family."},{"instruction":"Data: Agnes Kant, nationality, Netherlands; Socialist Party (Netherlands), leader, Emile Roemer; Agnes Kant, party, Socialist Party (Netherlands) Sentence about the following d","output":"Agnes Kant is a Dutch national who was the leader of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands while Emile Roemer was also a leader of the same party."},{"instruction":"Question 1: How much distance can an Airbus A380 cover with its fuel tank filled to max level?

The difficulty of retrieving the information correlates to how strongly you will remember it. For example, if you are memorizing a presentation, pause and think wow, i missed that presentation. Let's go back for it later and no longer repeat it; this will still make it harder for you to remember information. This will help you retain the information all at once and can also make a much more significant impact on the learning process.

Load the dishwasher carefully. Allow crystal to warm up. Use a small amount of detergent. Run the dishwasher. Let the crystal cool. Remove the crystal carefully.","output":"If you are a collector of fine crystal, you may be wondering if it is safe to clean your delicate pieces in the dishwasher. While not all types of crystal can withstand the high temperatures and harsh detergents used in a dishwasher cycle, many manufacturers now offer dishwasher-safe options. Before cleaning your crystal in the dishwasher, it is important to ensure that it is indeed dishwasher safe. Check for any warning labels on the packaging or contact the manufacturer for specific instructions. Using the dishwasher on crystal that is not dishwasher safe can result in damage or discoloration. Once you have confirmed that your crystal is suitable for the dishwasher, it is important to load it carefully, avoiding overcrowding or stacking pieces on top of each other. This will help prevent any chipping or scratching that could occur during the wash cycle. Before starting the dishwasher cycle, be sure to allow the crystal to warm up to room temperature first. Placing cold crystal in the hot dishwasher can cause it to crack or break. When using detergent, use a small amount, as excessive detergent can leave residue or cause cloudiness on the crystal surfaces. Some users even recommend using a detergent specifically designed for crystal or glassware. During the wash cycle, it's important to note that some dishwashers come with a \\"delicate\\" or \\"crystal\\" setting that uses a gentler wash cycle for these types of items. If your dishwasher does not have this setting, choosing a shorter or less intense cycle can also help prevent damage to your crystal. After the wash cycle is complete, allow your crystal to cool down inside the dishwasher before removing it. This will help prevent any sudden temperature changes that can cause damage. When removing the crystal, handle it carefully to avoid any scratches or chips. In summary, cleaning your crystal in the dishwasher can be a safe and convenient option, as long as you ensure that it is dishwasher safe, load it carefully, use a small amount of detergent, and choose a gentle wash cycle. With the right precautions, your crystal can remain sparkling and beautiful for years to come."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence that is about a restaurant with all the following properties: name = Loch Fyne, eatType = restaurant, food = English, familyFriendly = ye","output":"Loch Fyne is an English restaurant that is family-friendly."},{"instruction":"he bonus game can be retriggered. name of this page is symbol bonus reels slot game tiger left ladies symbols slot.

The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell's death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect good bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Taxpayers’ Alliance slam parking charges as 'a disgraceful tax on the sick' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The Heart of England Hospitals Trust in Birmingham has been identified as the hospital trust that charges the most in parking fees a year, totalling almost £3.9 million. This news has been condemned by the Taxpayers’ Alliance, who referred to the fees as a \\"disgraceful tax on the sick.\\" The amount charged by the trust, which covers hospitals in Birmingham, Solihull, and Sutton Coldfield, has outraged many in the area, particularly those who must rely on frequent visits to the hospital. The fees charged by hospitals across the country have been the subject of criticism for some time, with campaigners arguing that they add to the financial burden already experienced by patients and their families. The Heart of England Trust has defended its charges, explaining that the money is used to maintain and improve the hospital's parking facilities. However, many argue that the fees are exploitative and place an unfair burden on those in need of medical care. The Taxpayers' Alliance has called for a cap on parking fees at hospitals across the UK, arguing that the charges are unnecessary and contribute to the financial stress experienced by many families. This call has been echoed by many patients and their families who feel that parking fees are an unnecessary expense when they are already struggling with the cost of medical care. In light of this news, it is clear that there is a need for action to be taken to address the issue of parking charges at hospitals. While hospital trusts may argue that the money is necessary to maintain their facilities, there are other options available, such as providing free or reduced parking for patients and their families. It is time for hospitals across the UK to review their parking charges and ensure that patients and their families are not being exploited. The tax on the sick must end, and it is the responsibility of hospital trusts to take action to make this happen."},{"instruction":"Please answer a question about the following article about Antarctica: Several governments maintain permanent manned research stations on the continent.

Among the more amusing tidbits: Women are “not comfortable with their husbands and boyfriends getting waxed by other men,” Padilha says, but men are concerned about becoming aroused by a female waxer—so, one aesthetician explains, “we hire only older women for the waxing, like your grandmother.” One 35yearold female waxer explains why: Some men assume “that since they're naked, you're gonna give them head,” she says, recalling a time a client got so aggressive she had to taze him.","output":"Male Waxing: The Growing Popularity and Surprising Facts Male waxing, once considered taboo, is now growing in popularity. Jed Lipinksi, a writer for Salon, experienced firsthand the rising trend when he was tasked with writing a story about male waxing. Eventually, Lipinski agreed to undergo a \\"Manzilian\\" from Janea Padilha, the inventor of the Brazilian wax. Despite the pain, he shared that he felt invigorated after the waxing. Although the trend is increasing, the industry is not without its challenges. For instance, some women are uncomfortable with their partners getting waxed by another man. Meanwhile, men are worried about becoming aroused by a female waxer. To overcome this, some waxing salons hire only older women to perform the service in a bid to avoid any potential misunderstanding. One esthetician shared that a client once became so aggressive that she had to taze him. This highlights an important point that the industry needs to address: the need for safety measures to protect both clients and estheticians. Despite the potential challenges, manscaping has been embraced by many, including athletes and celebrities. The trend is also helping to break down stereotypes and challenging traditional views of masculinity. In conclusion, male waxing is a trend that is here to stay. It offers a variety of benefits for men, including improved hygiene, aesthetic appeal, and an enhanced sense of confidence. While there may be challenges, the growing acceptance of male waxing is a testament to a more open-minded and inclusive society."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: According to Buddhist traditions a Buddha is a fully awakened being who has completely purified his mind of the three poisons of desire, aversion and ignorance.

French historians usually place the period, called the Siècle des Lumières (Century of Enlightenments), between 1715 and 1789, from the beginning of the reign of Louis XV until the French Revolution. If taken back to the mid17th century, the Enlightenment would trace its origins to Descartes' Discourse on Method, published in 1637. In France, many cited the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1687. It is argued by several historians and philosophers that the beginning of the Enlightenment is when Descartes shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty by his cogito ergo sum published in 1637. As to its end, most scholars use the last years of the century, often choosing the French Revolution of 1789 or the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars (1804–15) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Peter Brownstein, a Scout and pizza delivery man, made headlines when he went out of his way to help same-sex couples who had been waiting in line outside a courthouse in Utah to get married. After a judge struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage, long lines formed outside the courthouse, and many couples were in desperate need of food and water. Brownstein saw an opportunity to help and quickly sprang into action. Wearing a rainbow neckerchief with his Scout uniform, Brownstein delivered pizza to the hungry and thirsty couples, providing them with much-needed sustenance as they waited for their turn to be married. His simple act of kindness garnered national attention and was widely praised by both the LGBTQ community and the public at large. Brownstein's gesture was particularly poignant given the history of the Boy Scouts of America, which had long barred openly gay members from joining. However, in May of 2018, the organization reversed its policy and began allowing openly gay youths to join. Brownstein's decision to wear his rainbow neckerchief with his uniform was a symbolic gesture that showed his support for LGBTQ rights within the organization. Overall, Brownstein's actions demonstrate the power of small acts of kindness and the importance of showing support for marginalized communities. As the fight for LGBTQ rights continues, it is heartening to see individuals like Brownstein stepping up to lend their support and make a positive difference in the lives of others."},{"instruction":"am sure if he had longer to ask his question he would have pointed out the fact that the former Progressive Conservative government was busy making important structural changes and if it would have had just a little more time it would have probably pursued the necessary fundamental changes we are discussing as the Progressive Conservative Party of 1999.

If you're planning to install a sump pump in your home, there are a few key steps you'll need to follow. First, research the parts and functions of a sump pump to become familiar with the different components. You'll need to purchase a sump pump, a basin, a 4-inch Schedule 10 perforated irrigation pipe, PVC piping, and a check valve. Next, dig a trench around the perimeter of your basement or crawl space. Create a hole for the basin so that the top is flush with the concrete floor. Lay down the 4-inch irrigation pipe onto rock to help with drainage. Cut drain pipe holes in the basin using a reciprocating saw and connect the irrigation pipe to the sump pump basin. Lay plastic over the rocks and piping and top them with concrete mix for added stability. Locate the spot to drill between the rim joists on the inside and outside of your home. Create a hole between the rim joists using a hole saw, then drill a 1⁄4 to 3⁄8 inch hole into 6 to 8 inches of PVC piping. Attach the PVC piping to the pump and connect a check valve on top. Connect another section of PVC piping that reaches the top of the basin. Finally, connect PVC piping between the sump pump outlet and your home's rim joist hole. Once everything is connected, turn on the sump pump to test it and ensure it's draining water away from your home as intended. With these steps, you'll have a fully functioning sump pump to help protect your home against water damage. Remember to perform regular maintenance on your sump pump to keep it working properly, including cleaning the basin and testing the pump periodically."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Upcomingbasicmedicmodule4course","output":"Upcoming Basic Medic Module 4 courses are available."},{"instruction":"Wanker Records is a Marburg, Hessenbased independent record label, focused on punk rock, which was started by Nick Wanker (founder of the Pot Porn Electro Punk Band Frank Fortuna, guitarist for the punk rock bands Fuzzbeer, Fußpils, the Heartbreakers and One Way Down) in 2001.

HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2 to 4fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading generalpurpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).

Once the leather is colored, the edges need to be smoothed out to remove any roughness or unevenness. A sandpaper block can be used for this process, but be careful not to sand too hard and remove too much of the dye or paint. Next, it's time to punch holes for stitching if necessary. This is an important step if you plan to join multiple pieces of leather together or add any embellishments. A leather hole punch is a worthwhile investment for any leather crafter. Finally, add any other details you wish, such as stamping and embossing. These techniques can really elevate the final look of your project, adding texture and dimension to the leather. As a finishing touch, consider adding a clear finish to protect the leather from wear and tear. This step is especially important for items that will be used frequently, such as wallets and belts. In conclusion, taking the time to pay attention to the edges of your leather and adding in personal touches can really make a difference in the finished product. With these tips, your leather projects will be sure to impress."},{"instruction":"d beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.

One of the first things you'll need to do is choose a location. This will likely depend on the number of people in attendance, but ideally, you want a spot with plenty of obstacles for cover and a space large enough to accommodate everyone. Another important factor is an available backup location nearby. Unexpected events such as a sudden change in weather conditions, last-minute conflicts, or logistical difficulties can occur. Having a backup location is always a good idea. Once you've chosen your location(s), it's time to set a date and time for your event. Choose a time that works for everyone involved and try to avoid scheduling conflicts that may interfere with turnout. Next, recruit Nerfers to join in on the fun. You can do this through social media, email lists or by word of mouth. It's best if you establish rules right from the onset, ensuring everyone is aware of what's expected of them before the game begins. This includes informing everyone of the safety equipment required, and what weapons are considered allowable. It's important to decide on one or more Nerf games beforehand to add to the fun and excitement. Some great options include Capture the Flag or Last Man Standing. Make sure to explain the rules of each game ahead of time and give everyone an opportunity to ask questions. Remember, safety is essential even though Nerf blasters are relatively safe for children and adults. Remind everyone of essential safety tips throughout the game and keep an eye on everyone to ensure everyone is playing safely. In summary, organizing a successful Nerf battle requires a bit of planning, but it's well worth the effort.

Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews.

While no one has perfect skin, there are some easy steps you can take to prevent breakouts and keep your skin looking and feeling great. One crucial step is to use a gentle cleanser between breakouts as a way of removing oil and dirt from your face. This way, you can avoid over-drying your skin or using harsh products that may exacerbate acne. It is also essential to make a habit of washing your face regularly, regardless of whether you have breakout or not. By doing so, you can remove excess oil and bacteria from your skin. Removing your makeup before going to bed is also crucial in preventing breakouts. Leaving makeup on your face can clog your pores and cause acne. So, make sure you find a noncomedogenic makeup to avoid clogging your pores and causing further breakouts. Another helpful tip is to keep hair oil away from your face. Oils from hair can easily transfer to the face, causing breakouts. Pulling back your hair or wearing a headband may prevent hair oil from your hair reaching your face and causing acne. Reducing your stress level is another essential factor in maintaining clear skin. When we are under stress, our hormone levels can be affected, leading to the production of excess sebum, which can contribute to breakouts. Therefore, it's essential to manage your stress levels and engage in activities that can help reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, or relaxation techniques. In conclusion, while achieving clear skin can be challenging, these tips can help you prevent breakouts and maintain a radiant complexion. Remember to use a gentle cleanser, wash your face regularly, remove your makeup before bed, avoid hair oil coming in contact with your face, and manage your stress levels for a healthy and beautiful skin."},{"instruction":"Premise: A woman is bowling barefoot as 2 people in the background head toward the video games.

St. John was first claimed by Denmark in 1718, although it took several years for the Danish West India Company to establish a permanent settlement on the island. In the early years, there was relatively little demand for slave labor on St. John, and the population of European settlers remained small. However, by the mid-18th century, the sugar industry had taken off in the Caribbean, and demand for African laborers increased. This led to a rapid increase in the number of enslaved Africans brought to St. John, with the population of slaves surpassing that of the European inhabitants by the late 1700s. The exact timeline of this demographic shift is difficult to pinpoint due to gaps in historical records, but it's estimated that by the time of Denmark's abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 1803, the number of enslaved Africans on St. John was at least five times larger than the number of Europeans. This stark demographic divide shaped the island's history and culture in profound ways, with African traditions and languages influencing everything from music and cuisine to religion and social customs. The legacy of this period can still be seen and felt on St. John today, making it an important site for understanding the complex history of the Caribbean and the impact of the transatlantic slave trade."},{"instruction":"A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles, arranged in a nonoverlapping fashion, e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor, by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles (a typical size is 1 in × 1 in (25 mm × 25 mm), as for example, on the floor of the University of Toronto pool, though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in (51 mm × 51 mm) are used).

Mint is an herb that is commonly used in cocktails, tea, and various recipes, and it's always a good idea to have a stash of fresh mint in your kitchen. Here's how to freeze mint leaves in ice cubes: First, remove the mint leaves from the stems. You can do this by gently pulling the leaves off or using a knife to cut them. Make sure that you use only the leaves and discard the stems. Rinse the leaves in cold water and give them a thorough shake to remove any excess water. Next, take your ice cube tray and press the mint leaves into the compartments. You can chop the leaves finely or leave them whole, depending on your preference. Pack as many leaves as you can into each compartment, leaving a small space at the top. After your mint leaves are loaded in the compartments, fill them up with water, making sure that the leaves are fully submerged. Use a spoon to press the leaves down so that they stay in place. Leave a small gap at the top of each compartment. Now, pop the tray into the freezer and freeze the mint leaves overnight. The leaves will be locked in the ice cubes, which will preserve their freshness. When you're ready to use your mint leaves, simply pop out an ice cube and thaw it as needed. You can add the ice cubes to your tea, cocktails, or even use them in cooking. By freezing your mint leaves in ice cubes, you won't have to worry about your mint going bad before you have a chance to use it.

When creating a project, the finishing touches can make all the difference in the final product. One of the most important steps in finishing a knit project is joining the sides. To join the sides of your knit project, first, knit back and forth a few times. This will create a solid edge for you to join later. Once you have knit the desired number of rows, you can begin joining the sides. There are two common methods for joining the sides of a knit project. The basic joining method involves lining up the edges of your knitting and sewing them together using a yarn needle and the same yarn used to knit the project. This method is quick and easy, but it can leave a visible seam. If you want to create an invisible seam, you can use the invisible joining method. To do this, line up the edges of your knitting with the right sides facing each other. Using a crochet hook and a scrap piece of yarn, single crochet along the edge of one piece of knitting, then single crochet along the edge of the second piece of knitting. Once you have crocheted along both edges, pull the scrap yarn tight to join the pieces together. This creates a seamless join that is almost completely invisible. Finally, once you have joined the sides of your knitting, you can seam the open edge. This can be done using either the basic or invisible joining method depending on your preference. With the edge seamed, your project is complete and ready to be enjoyed!

It is a political and cultural allegory of Mexico's postColumbian odyssey, as even a passing glance at Mexico's history will attest. In contrast to Like Water for Chocolate, Erendira expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work. (A good starting point is to see the grandmother character as Spain: proud, aloof, sorrowful and, above all else, weigheddownwithhistory.) The ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the outcome of history (i.e. the present) is always obscure, since we are too close to it for honest evaluation. Refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director, given the ambitions of the film. Erendira is gorgeous.

The kick took place at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans and covered a distance of only 63 yards. Interestingly, the kick did not occur during the first, second, or third quarter, but rather in the final seconds of the fourth quarter with only two seconds remaining on the clock. The Saints found themselves trailing the Lions by a single point at the time, and Dempsey's miraculous field goal gave them a 19-17 victory. Dempsey's record-breaking field goal was accomplished with a unique advantage. Due to a birth defect, Dempsey was born without toes on his right foot and had a shortened kicking shoe that allowed him to kick soccer-style with greater accuracy and power. This advantage was instrumental in allowing him to make such a lengthy kick, a record that would stand for over 40 years before being surpassed by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos in 2013. In conclusion, the shortest field goal in NFL history was achieved by Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter of a game against the Detroit Lions on November 8, 1970. Despite the incredible distance of the kick, it was not accomplished until the final seconds of the game, with Dempsey's accuracy and unique kicking style being instrumental in securing the victory for his team."},{"instruction":"Jayson Williams is sentenced for driving while intoxicated.
