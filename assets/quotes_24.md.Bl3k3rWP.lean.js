Naturalists catered to polite society's desire for erudition – many texts had an explicit instructive purpose. However, natural history was often a political affair. As E. C. Spary writes, the classifications used by naturalists slipped between the natural world and the social ... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural, but also the dominance of the natural over the social. The idea of taste (le goût) was a social indicator: to truly be able to categorize nature, one had to have the proper taste, an ability of discretion shared by all members of polite society. In this way natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time, but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class. From this basis, naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works.

Tayasal was the last independent city-state of the Maya civilization, located in present-day Guatemala. It was conquered by the Spanish in the 17th century, after which they established their colonial capital in the nearby city of Flores. On the other hand, Payo Obispo was not established as a capital until much later, in the early 19th century. It was created by the Spanish as a strategic location for military purposes, as it was situated between the cities of Guatemala and Chiapas. The town grew and eventually became the capital of the Department of San Marcos in Guatemala. While both Tayasal and Payo Obispo were significant in their own ways, historical records suggest that Tayasal was occupied and conquered before the establishment of Payo Obispo as a colonial capital. The Mayan civilization flourished in Tayasal for centuries before its defeat by the Spanish, while Payo Obispo was a relatively new development in the region.

However, their presence can sometimes pose a danger to humans, especially those who are allergic to their stings. If you want to keep your property free from buzzing pests, it's important to take proactive steps to prevent infestations. Here are the steps you can take to keep bees and wasps away from your property: Remove All Nests and Honeycombs The easiest way to prevent bees and wasps from settling down in your property is to remove any existing nests and honeycombs. These structures serve as breeding grounds for these insects, and they can quickly spread to other areas of your property. You can hire an experienced pest control professional to safely remove these nests and ensure that the area is free from any remaining insects. Make All Necessary Repairs Immediately Bees and wasps can easily find their way into your property through cracks or gaps in walls, windows, or doors. To prevent their entry, you should check your property regularly for any signs of wear and tear that may allow pests to enter. You should repair any holes, cracks, or gaps immediately to prevent pests from getting in. Clear Your Property of Ideal Nesting Spots Bees and wasps prefer to nest in quiet, dark, and protected areas. To prevent them from nesting on your property, you should take steps to make it less attractive to them. Trim back any overgrown vegetation that provides ideal hiding spots for pests. You can also cover or seal potential nesting areas, such as empty birdhouses, sheds, or garages. Conclusion By following these simple steps, you can effectively prevent bees and wasps from establishing colonies in your property. However, if you notice any signs of infestation, such as an increase in activity or the appearance of nests, you should immediately seek the assistance of a qualified pest control professional to address the problem.

Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage.

At the arrangement of editor Max Eastman, the American magazine Reader's Digest also published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling The Road to Serfdom to reach a far wider audience than academics.

This often occurs in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times in a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having four seasons in one day, a phrase that is part of local popular culture and familiar to many visitors to the city. The lowest temperature on record is −2.8 °C (27.0 °F), on 21 July 1869. The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was 46.4 °C (115.5 °F), on 7 February 2009.

Install the carbon filter in your exhaust system. Run your filter 24 hours a day. Keep humidity below 70 percent. Change the carbon filter regularly.","output":"When it comes to growing plants indoors, odor control is a major concern. Fortunately, there is a simple and effective solution -- a carbon filter, also known as a \\"scrubber.\\" To use a carbon filter, you must first purchase one that is appropriate for the size of your grow area. Next, install the filter in your exhaust system so that it will remove odors before they are released into the air. Once your filter is installed, it's important to run it 24 hours a day to ensure that odors are continuously removed. In addition to using a carbon filter, it's also important to keep the humidity in your grow area below 70 percent. High humidity can cause mold and mildew to form, which can contribute to odors. By keeping humidity under control, you'll reduce the likelihood of unpleasant smells developing. Finally, it's important to change your carbon filter regularly. Over time, the filter will become saturated with odor-causing compounds and will no longer be effective. Most filters will last for several months, but it's important to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for replacement. In short, if you're growing plants indoors, a carbon filter is a must-have item. By installing and running a filter, controlling humidity, and changing your filter regularly, you can ensure that your grow area is odor-free and pleasant to be in."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: Though the true dimensions of species diversity remain uncertain, estimates range from 2.6–7.8 million species with a mean of 5.5 million.

This will induce an additional current in the antenna element, changing the current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage. Thus the antenna's impedance, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna.

This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.

The banner read, 'Roman's dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game', a clear reference to Abramovich's wealth and investment in the Chelsea football club. While fans are entitled to their opinions and free speech, it is important to note that Crystal Palace has had its own issues with financial mismanagement in the past. In fact, the south London club went into administration in 2010, leaving businesses unpaid and 29 staff members redundant. It is also important to consider the impact of such a banner in the wider context of football culture. While rivalry and banter between fans is a common and accepted part of the game, messages that could be interpreted as defamatory, discriminatory or offensive should not be tolerated. The Football Association (FA) has strict guidelines on acceptable behavior and language at football games, and it would not be surprising if they took action against Crystal Palace for this incident. Co-chairman Steve Parish should take action against the fans responsible for the banner and make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated at the club. In conclusion, while it is understandable that fans want to express their passion for their team, it is important to do so in a respectful and appropriate manner. The banner displayed by Crystal Palace fans was inappropriate and potentially defamatory, and the club deserves to be charged by the FA for this behavior. Additionally, it is crucial that clubs take a strong stance against such behavior and take action against fans who act inappropriately."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Can't Help Thinking About Me is a song written by David Bowie in 1965 and released as a single under the name David Bowie with The Lower Third.

Unfortunately, no such list is readily available, and compiling one would require significant time and effort. Moreover, the exact length of each touchdown run may not be consistent across different sources and may be subject to interpretation or error.

Additionally, it is necessary to turn off the water supply to the toilet before getting started.

This can be done by holding down the flush handle until most of the water is drained, then using a plunger to force out the remaining water. After draining the water, the water supply hose should be disconnected next. It is important to have a bucket or a towel on hand to catch any excess water that may drip out. The next step is to remove the two nuts that attach the toilet to the floor. This can be done using a wrench or pliers, and it's important to take care not to damage the bolts or the floor when doing so. Once the nuts have been removed, the toilet can be lifted straight up and moved onto the newspapers or towels. Make sure to lift with your legs, not your back, and be careful not to drop or damage the toilet in the process.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

The law, which recently passed with a large majority in the lower house of French parliament, will impose a fine of 190 for those who violate it. According to a recent poll, French citizens overwhelmingly support the ban on Islamic headscarves. The ban has been a topic of discussion for many years in France, a country with a population of about 3.5 million Muslims. Some officials argue the ban is necessary to uphold the country's secular values, while others argue it's a violation of religious freedom. As the ban on Islamic headscarves becomes law, it's important for individuals to be aware of the potential consequences of violating it. Though the fine may seem minimal, it's still a punishable offense in France. Those who practice Islam and wear headscarves in public places may need to reconsider their attire or risk being fined. In conclusion, the new ban on Islamic headscarves in public places is a notable change in France's laws. Although some may see it as a necessary step to uphold the country's values, others may view it as a violation of basic religious freedoms. Whatever the case may be, France's citizens and visitors should be aware of the new law and its potential consequences."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: How did the Second Bulgarian Empire come into existence?","output":"The Second Bulgarian Empire came into existence in the late 12th century when two Bulgarian dynasties, the Asenids and the Shishmanids, united to overthrow the Byzantine rule. The First Bulgarian Empire, which was established in the 7th century, had fallen under Byzantine control in the 10th century and remained a part of the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century. The rebellion against the Byzantine rule was initiated by two brothers, Peter and Asen, who were leaders of a group of Vlachs (a nomadic group inhabiting the Balkans). They were joined by other dissatisfied Bulgarian aristocrats, and together they conquered several cities in Thrace and Macedonia. In 1186 they declared the establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire with the capital at Tarnovo. The Asenids, who were descendants of the Bulgarian royal family, ruled the new empire until 1257, when they were overthrown by a rival dynasty, the Shishmanids. The Shishmanids ruled until the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria in the late 14th century. Under the Second Bulgarian Empire, Bulgaria became a powerful state in the Balkans and expanded its territories by conquering neighboring regions. Bulgaria was also an important cultural and religious center, with Tarnovo becoming a center of learning and arts. The Second Bulgarian Empire had to face several external threats, including the Crusaders and the Mongols, and internal conflicts among the Bulgarian aristocracy. But despite these challenges, the empire left a significant impact on Bulgarian history and culture. In conclusion, the Second Bulgarian Empire was established in the late 12th century by the Asenids and the Shishmanids, who united to overthrow the Byzantine rule.

The charity predicts 50 million more people will go hungry as a result. Calls on companies including Kellogg's to take action and reduce emissions.","output":"According to a new report from Oxfam, the failure of companies to tackle climate change could result in financial ruin. The report states that the \\"Big 10\\" food and drink companies are emitting more greenhouse gases than entire countries such as Scandinavia, and that shifts in weather patterns due to climate change are already affecting food supplies worldwide. The charity warns that if companies such as Kellogg's do not take action to reduce their emissions and address the issue of climate change, the consequences could be dire. The report predicts that as many as 50 million more people could go hungry as a result of these changes. The food and drink industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around a quarter of global emissions. However, the report suggests that there is still much that can be done to reduce these emissions, such as adopting more sustainable farming practices and reducing food waste. In addition to the potential humanitarian cost of inaction on climate change, there are also financial risks for companies. As consumers increasingly demand more sustainable and environmentally-friendly products, those companies that fail to adapt could face financial ruin. The Oxfam report is a reminder that the issue of climate change is not just an environmental concern, but also an economic and social one. It is up to companies such as Kellogg's to take action and do their part to address this urgent issue. By reducing their emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, these companies can help to ensure that the world's food supplies remain secure for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best highspirited comedies I have ever seen. It is misunderstood since it lacks the social commentary values that many films of the day (1969) required to be successful. The characters are overthetop satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors. Christopher Plummer shines especially bright as Lord Foppington, a noble with hair too big to fit in the door. The plot involves the usual 18th century stuff; mistaken identities, thwarted romances, corrupt government officials, and jokes at every turn. It answers the questions: What happens when 4 rambunctious, eager to party sailors are on leave in a small British coastal town? And, who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out? Despite doing poorly at the box office, it has great costumes, excellent music(based on the Mermaid Theatre musical of the same name), great,lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic.

The Pechenegs were nomads roaming the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the Rus' for agricultural goods and other products. The lucrative Rus' trade with the Byzantine Empire had to pass through Pechenegcontrolled territory, so the need for generally peaceful relations was essential.

Willerton, who trained for and completed the London Marathon earlier this year, admitted to gaining a few pounds during the training process. However, instead of being celebrated for her athletic achievement, she was the target of body shaming on social media, with some Twitter users even questioning her qualification to run the marathon. Unfortunately, the negativity did not stop there. Willerton was also criticized for her appearance in a photoshoot at the Chelsea Flower Show, where she wore a floral dress that some deemed as \\"unflattering.\\" Again, she received backlash on Twitter, with comments such as, \\"Looks like Amy Willerton has eaten all the flowers\\" and \\"Amy Willerton needs to lose some weight before she bursts out of that dress.\\" Despite the hurtful comments, Willerton refused to let the haters bring her down. Instead, she opted for a fat-freezing treatment in order to tone-up. This non-surgical procedure, also known as cryolipolysis, involves freezing and killing fat cells in targeted areas of the body. Willerton shared her experience on Instagram, saying, \\"I'm not ashamed to admit that I turned to a non-invasive body sculpting game-changer, @skinoassassins to help me improve the contours of my body.\\" While some may argue that Willerton is promoting an unhealthy and unrealistic standard of beauty, it's important to remember that everyone's journey to self-confidence and body positivity is unique. Willerton's decision to undergo a fat-freezing treatment should not be judged, nor should her weight gain during marathon training. Instead, what we should focus on is supporting and uplifting individuals regardless of their size or shape. In conclusion, Amy Willerton's story serves as a reminder that body shaming has no place in our society. We must strive to create a culture of acceptance and positivity, where individuals can feel confident and proud of their bodies no matter what they look like."},{"instruction":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Eagle, eatType = coffee shop, food = French, customer rating = 3 out of 5, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes, near = Burger King","output":"The Eagle is a French coffee shop located in the city centre, near Burger King.

The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells.

The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two ironhulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an allarmored battle fleet.

Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised? Your small intestine, and not your stomach, does most of the work! Question: What is chemical digestion, and where does it occur?

Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.

Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a nonJew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, Ashkenazic refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry. Reform Judaism, which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews.

Critics see the conflict as a quagmire—an endless waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern US interests. Fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since. The draft became extremely unpopular, and President Nixon ended it in 1973, forcing the military (the Army especially) to rely entirely upon volunteers.

These classical concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks. What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a society of events. By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the fallacy of misplaced concreteness).
