Good luck with your game development!"},{"instruction":"How to check capillary refill time in 3 years old boy","output":"Capillary refill time (CRT) is a simple test to assess circulatory status, especially perfusion, by estimating how quickly blood returns to distal capillaries after being blanched. It can provide useful information about the heart's ability to pump blood and the condition of the peripheral circulation. To check the capillary refill time in a 3-year-old boy, follow these steps: 1. **Ensure a warm environment:** Ensure that the child and the environment are warm, as cold temperatures can cause vasoconstriction and falsely prolong capillary refill time. 2. **Explain the procedure:** If the child is old enough to understand, explain what you are going to do in simple terms to help minimize any anxiety or resistance to the procedure. 3. **Choose an appropriate site:** The preferred site is the nail bed, but it can also be done on the skin if the nails are not an option (for example, due to nail polish or if the fingers are cold). The sternum can also be used, especially in emergency settings. 4. **Position the child:** Have the child seated or lying down comfortably. 5. **Apply pressure:** Using your thumb or a finger, apply pressure to the nail bed or the selected skin site for about 5 seconds, enough to cause blanching (whitening) of the skin beneath the fingernail or the skin. Be gentle, but firm. 6. **Release and observe:** Release the pressure and observe the time it takes for the color to return to the blanched area. In a healthy child, the normal range for capillary refill is usually less than 2 seconds. 7. **Repeat if necessary:** If you didn’t get a clear result the first time, wait for color to fully return and then attempt to measure the capillary refill time again. It is important to note that capillary refill time can be influenced by several factors, including room and skin temperature, lighting conditions, and the child's recent activity levels. Therefore, a prolonged CRT should be interpreted in the context of the overall clinical picture, including other signs and symptoms the child may have. If you are concerned about the child's capillary refill time or other aspects of their health, it is prudent to seek advice from a healthcare professional. They can conduct a more thorough examination and provide appropriate guidance and care."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Today, T-Mobile announced that SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket launched the first set of Starlink satellites with Direct to Cell capabilities, following the livestreamed webcast last night. This is a significant milestone following last year’s joint announcement of the Coverage Above and Beyond initiative, which aims to bring connectivity nearly everywhere in the U.S. for Un-carrier customers — even in many of the most remote locations previously unreachable by traditional cell signals from any provider … aka dead zones. Now that the satellites are in low-Earth orbit, field testing can soon begin on the new service that will leverage SpaceX’s constellation of satellites with Direct to Cell technology and T-Mobile’s industry-leading wireless network.\\"Our mission is to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world and today is another step forward in keeping our customers connected even in the most remote locations for added peace of mind when they need it most,\\" said Mike Katz, President of Marketing, Strategy and Products, T-Mobile. \\"Today’s launch is a pivotal moment for this groundbreaking alliance with SpaceX and our global partners around the world, as we work to make dead zones a thing of the past.\\"With well over half a million square miles of the U.S. and vast stretches of ocean unreachable by terrestrial network coverage, due to terrain limitations, land-use restrictions and more, this new service aims to give customers a crucial additional layer of connectivity when and where they need it most. With the new service, the goal is to eliminate worrying about mobile dead zones and lugging around expensive satellite phones — Un-carrier customers would be connected nearly everywhere they can see the sky, and in most cases, with the phone they already have.Story continuesToday marks the first of many Starlink satellite launches to come that will include Direct to Cell capabilities. Initially, the service will begin with text messaging, with voice and data coverage to follow in the coming years.\\"The launch of these first Direct to Cell satellites is an exciting milestone for SpaceX to demonstrate our technology,\\" said Dr. Sara Spangelo, Sr. Director of Satellite Engineering. \\"We look forward to rapidly scaling up Direct to Cell with our partner operators around the world and rolling out messaging service for T-Mobile customers!\\"T-Mobile and SpaceX’s shared vision is to provide truly universal coverage and last year, they issued an open invitation to wireless providers worldwide to expand globally with reciprocal roaming. As of today, five wireless providers are already onboard to launch Direct to Cell technology including KDDI (Japan), Optus (Australia), One NZ (New Zealand), Rogers (Canada) and others, with more to come. And the invitation still stands for any carrier with the shared goal of global connectivity to join.

However, please note that the maximum alpha value in \`rgba\` is \`1.0\` for full opacity, and \`0\` for completely transparent. So if you'd like a semi-transparent overlay, you would use a value between \`0\` and \`1\`. In your case, \`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)\` would give you a 60% opaque black overlay. Here's how you can create this with CSS using a pseudo-element: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Background with Overlay</title> <style> .background-image { position: relative; width: 100%; height: 300px; /* Adjust to your preferred value */ background-image: url('path-to-your-image.jpg'); background-size: cover; background-position: center; } .background-image::before { content: ''; position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\\"background-image\\"> <!-- Your content goes here --> </div> </body> </html> \`\`\` Replace \`path-to-your-image.jpg\` with the path to your actual background image. In the above example, \`.background-image::before\` creates a pseudo-element that is positioned absolutely within the \`.background-image\` element, which allows it to cover the entire area of the parent element. The \`background\` property of this pseudo-element has the semi-transparent black color defined with \`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)\`. This example assumes the \`.background-image\` div is the container for your background image and the overlay. Adjust the \`.background-image\`'s height and other properties as needed to fit your layout."},{"instruction":"I set width and height to 100% but it still doesn't cover the entire page","output":"To ensure your background image and its overlay cover the entire page, several elements including the \`html\`, \`body\`, as well as your \`.background-image\` div need to be set to 100% width and height. This will stretch the \`.background-image\` container to cover the entire viewport, provided that there is no extra padding or margin on the \`body\` or \`html\` elements that would otherwise add space around your container. Here's an updated version of the CSS to cover the entire page: \`\`\`css html, body { height: 100%; /* Make sure the html and body cover the full height */ margin: 0; /* Remove default margin */ padding: 0; /* Remove default padding */ } .background-image { position: relative; width: 100%; /* Width set to 100% of the parent element - in this case, the body */ height: 100%; /* Height set to 100% of the parent element - in this case, the body */ background-image: url('path-to-your-image.jpg'); background-size: cover; background-position: center; background-attachment: fixed; /* Optional: this will make sure the image does not scroll with the content */ } .background-image::before { content: ''; position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); /* Semi-transparent black overlay */ } \`\`\` Make sure that no other styles are conflicting with these rules. Sometimes other CSS might be interfering and causing the \`width\` or \`height\` to not fill the entire viewport as intended. Ensure that the path to your background image is correct and that the image is properly loaded. This configuration assumes you want the overlay to be fixed along with the image. If you want the background image to scroll with the page, you can remove the \`background-attachment: fixed;\` property."},{"instruction":"message.textContent = \\"Chatbot: Thinking\\"; let thinkingDots = 0; chatLog.appendChild(messageContainer); messageContainer.appendChild(message); const thinkingInterval = setInterval(() => { thinkingDots = (thinkingDots + 1) % 4; message.textContent = \`Chatbot: Thinking{'.'.repeat(thinkingDots)}\`; }, 500); // Update the ellipsis every half a second to optimally milk the tension. const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 3000; setTimeout(() => { clearInterval(thinkingInterval); message.textContent = \`{role}: {text}\`; chatLog.scrollTop = chatLog.scrollHeight; }, delay); When the bot ends the thinking animation, make the final text fade in","output":"To make the final message fade in after ending the thinking animation, you can use CSS transitions. You need to initially set the opacity of the message to 0 and then gradually increase it to 1 once you're ready to show the final message. Here's what you need to do: 1. Update your CSS to define a transition effect on the \`opacity\` property of the message: \`\`\`css /* Add this CSS rule to your existing styles */ .message { transition: opacity 1s ease; /* Adjust the 1s duration to control the fade-in speed */ opacity: 0; /* Start with a fully transparent message */ } \`\`\` 2. Modify your JavaScript code to handle the fade-in effect. When the \`setTimeout\` callback triggers, set the \`opacity\` of \`message\` to 0, update the \`textContent\`, and then set the \`opacity\` back to 1 to start the fade-in effect: \`\`\`javascript // Your existing code up to the setTimeout: const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 3000; setTimeout(() => { clearInterval(thinkingInterval); // Start the fade-in effect: message.style.opacity = '0'; // Make it invisible immediately message.textContent = \`{role}: {text}\`; // Using requestAnimationFrame to ensure that the changes to // opacity are done after the browser has painted the opacity: 0 update requestAnimationFrame(() => { requestAnimationFrame(() => { message.style.opacity = '1'; // Fade in to full opacity }); }); chatLog.scrollTop = chatLog.scrollHeight; }, delay); \`\`\` By using \`requestAnimationFrame\` twice sequentially, you are ensuring that the changes to opacity occur on the next available frame. This is to guarantee the fade effect even if the browser tries to batch style changes, optimizing away what it might think is a redundant update. Remember to adjust the \`.message\` CSS class to correspond with whatever class or id you're using for your message elements, so that the transition effect is applied correctly.

Bear in mind that it's generally good practice to separate concerns by keeping your styling in CSS files and controlling classes or states with JavaScript. However, directly manipulating styles with JavaScript as shown is sometimes necessary for dynamic effects or when you want to avoid adding extra classes."},{"instruction":"if (role === \\"Chatbot\\") { message.textContent = \\"Chatbot: Thinking\\"; let thinkingDots = 0; chatLog.appendChild(messageContainer); messageContainer.appendChild(message); const thinkingInterval = setInterval(() => { thinkingDots = (thinkingDots + 1) % 4; message.textContent = \`Chatbot: Thinking{\\".\\".repeat(thinkingDots)}\`; }, 500); // Update the ellipsis every half a second to optimally milk the tension. const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 3000; setTimeout(() => { clearInterval(thinkingInterval); message.style.opacity = \\"0\\"; setTimeout(() => { message.style.transition = \\"opacity 1s ease\\"; }) message.textContent = \`{role}: {text}\`; setTimeout(() => { requestAnimationFrame(() => { message.style.opacity = \\"1\\"; }); }); chatLog.scrollTop = chatLog.scrollHeight; }, delay); }","output":"It seems like you want to perform a CSS transition of the \`opacity\` property from 0 to 1 for the message element to make the text fade in after the \\"Chatbot: Thinking...\\" animation. For the fade-in effect to work correctly, you first need to ensure the \`opacity\` is set to \`0\`, and a \`transition\` is applied to the element before you update its text content and then change the \`opacity\` to \`1\`. Here, I'm going to reorder the operations in your code and fix the issue where the transition is set after changing the opacity. Here's a revised version of your JavaScript code, which should apply the fade-in effect correctly: \`\`\`javascript if (role === \\"Chatbot\\") { message.textContent = \\"Chatbot: Thinking\\"; let thinkingDots = 0; chatLog.appendChild(messageContainer); messageContainer.appendChild(message); const thinkingInterval = setInterval(() => { thinkingDots = (thinkingDots + 1) % 4; message.textContent = \`Chatbot: Thinking{\\".\\".repeat(thinkingDots)}\`; }, 500); const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 3000; setTimeout(() => { clearInterval(thinkingInterval); // Prepare for the fade-in effect message.style.opacity = \\"0\\"; // Set opacity to 0 to hide the text initially message.style.transition = \\"opacity 1s ease\\"; // Apply transition // Update the message text message.textContent = \`{role}: {text}\`; // Trigger the fade-in effect setTimeout(() => { message.style.opacity = \\"1\\"; // Change opacity to 1 to start the transition }, 10); // Set a short delay to ensure that changes are rendered before the transition begins // Scroll to the newest message chatLog.scrollTop = chatLog.scrollHeight; }, delay); } \`\`\` In this update: 1. The \`transition\` style is immediately set after clearing the interval for the thinking animation. 2. The message's opacity is set to 0 to hide it. 3. A short timeout is introduced to allow the browser to update styles before starting the transition. This helps ensure that the transition effect happens after setting the \`opacity\` to \`0\`. A short timeout of 10ms is used to let the browser apply the initial styles before beginning the animation. 4. The \`message.textContent\` is set to the final message. 5. With the final \`setTimeout\`, we trigger the change in \`opacity\` from \`0\` to \`1\`, which initiates the fade-in transition. Note: Using two sequential \`requestAnimationFrame\` calls is another way to go about ensuring the browser has rendered changes, but in most cases, a short \`setTimeout\` can suffice. It is good to keep animations simple and avoid creating unnecessary layout thrashing that could arise from multiple nested \`requestAnimationFrame\` calls or timeouts."},{"instruction":"Add comprehensive comments on the code lines below: sagemaker_client = boto3.client('sagemaker') endpoints = sagemaker_client.list_endpoints()['Endpoints'] endpoint_configs = sagemaker_client.list_endpoint_configs()['EndpointConfigs'] print(f\\"All Endpoint configs:{endpoint_configs}\\") print(f\\"All endpoints:{endpoints}\\") if (len(endpoints) == 0 and len(endpoint_configs) == 0): DEPLOY = True else: DEPLOY = False DELETE = False if DELETE: for endpoint in endpoints: sagemaker_client.delete_endpoint(EndpointName=endpoint['EndpointName']) for config in endpoint_configs: config_name = config['EndpointConfigName'] sagemaker_client.delete_endpoint_config(EndpointConfigName=config_name) print(f\\"Sanity check, All Endpoint configs:{endpoint_configs}\\") print(f\\"Sanity check, All endpoints:{endpoints}\\")","output":"The provided code is using the SageMaker Python SDK to interact with the SageMaker service on AWS.

Ma première mission, celle de concevoir des affiches pour le GITEX, s'est transformée en un véritable périple créatif. D'une feuille blanche numérique, j'ai vu émerger des compositions colorées, des slogans accrocheurs, et des messages percutants. Chaque affiche était une conversation visuelle avec les visiteurs, et j'aspirais à ce que chaque pixel capte leur attention et leur curiosité. L'atelier de design est devenu ma scène, le logiciel de graphisme mon instrument, et les idées du marketing, la mélodie que je devais jouer.* *La collaboration et l'interaction ont été le socle de mon intégration. À travers le prisme de mes tâches, j'ai pu toucher à la complexité fascinante de l'organisation d'un voyage d'affaires à Essaouira. Ce n'était pas seulement une question de logistique, mais un ballet où chaque participant était à la fois danseur et chorégraphe. La coordination des horaires, la sélection des lieux de séjour, la préparation des activités de team building – tout était orchestré pour garantir l'harmonie des expériences et la réussite de l'événement.* *Cependant, c'est dans le sanctuaire des réunions avec le chef de département que j'ai réellement pris conscience de la dimension humaine qui se cache derrière les rouages d'une multinationale. J'ai pu observer avec admiration comment, autour de cette table, des idées naissaient, s'affrontaient et finalement s'unifiaient dans un but commun. L'apprentissage fut subtil mais profond; j'ai compris que le leadership n'était pas seulement une position, mais une danse entre écoute, vision et exécution.* *Quant à la gestion des projets, elle a été le théâtre où j'ai appris à jongler avec les multiples facettes du rôle d'un communiquant. Composer avec les délais et les attentes a aiguisé mon sens de l'organisation et de la réactivité.

Chaque jour était une page blanche sur laquelle j'invoquais mes compétences pour raconter une histoire captivante. Commençons par le commencement, avec la mission qui fut ma toute première responsabilité, celle qui a sculpté mes premières impressions et m’a plongé dans le bain de la créativité appliquée : la conception des affiches pour le GITEX. **La Conception des Affiches pour le GITEX** Le GITEX, ce rendez-vous international de la technologie, où les regards se tournent vers l'innovation et les affaires, où chaque stand déborde de promesses futures, de technologies de pointe et de solutions avancées. C'est là que DXC Technology Maroc devait briller, et mon rôle était de créer une fenêtre visuelle qui résumerait non seulement l’essence de l’entreprise, mais aussi son potentiel à façonner l'avenir. Les affiches devaient être à la fois un signal et une invitation, un écho de la créativité et du leadership de DXC. J'ai commencé par immerger mes sens dans l'ambiance de DXC, apprenant à connaître les produits, les services, la culture d'entreprise. La compréhension n'était pas seulement intellectuelle mais émotionnelle, cherchant à percevoir l’âme de ce que je devrais représenter graphiquement. J’ai analysé les campagnes précédentes, déchiffré les tendances actuelles et anticipé les futurs possibles. Cet exercice préliminaire fut un mélange entre un travail de détective et celui d’un visionnaire. Au fil de mes recherches, je récoltais des images, des mots, des concepts. Je les disposais sur le canevas numérique, les arrangeant, les juxtaposant, les superposant. Certains jours, le processus semblait presque organique, comme si les éléments cherchaient leur propre place. D’autres fois, il s'agissait d’un combat d’arrangement, un puzzle aux pièces réticentes. Je travaillais en étroite collaboration avec mon superviseur et les membres de l'équipe de marketing pour évaluer chaque itération, critique après critique, ébauche après ébauche. Quand enfin la pièce manquante trouvait sa place et que les contours de l'affiche prenaient forme, un sentiment de fierté m'envahissait. J'étais devenu le messager visuel de DXC Technology, j'avais traduit en langage graphique le discours de l'innovation. Pourtant, malgré l’achèvement de chaque affiche, je savais qu’il ne s'agissait que d'une esquisse dans mon parcours d'apprentissage, l'amorce d'une série de défis que j’allais affronter tout au long de mon stage. **Participation à la Stratégie Digitale sur les Réseaux Sociaux** Mon initiation au monde numérique a pris un nouveau tournant avec ma mission suivante : participer à la stratégie de contenu sur les médias sociaux de DXC Technology Maroc. LinkedIn, avec sa patine professionnelle et son réseau étendu, a été le principal terrain de jeu où j'ai pu explorer et participer à la danse du contenu digital.

Dès les premiers pas dans les locaux, on pouvait sentir la synergie qui animait les espaces ouverts. Des îlots de travail collaboratif aux zones de détente, tout était pensé pour favoriser l'échange et la créativité. Les murs ornementés de tableaux de réalisations et les salles de réunion portant les noms de grandes figures du monde de la technologie étaient une source constante d'inspiration.

Des cafés partagés au coin détente aux discussions stratégiques dans les salles vitrées, chaque moment était une opportunité d'apprendre et de se développer professionnellement. L'espace ouvert n'était pas seulement un concept architectural, mais le reflet de l'open-mindedness de l'entreprise. **2.2 Réalisation de Tâches** Les tâches qui m'étaient assignées étaient aussi variées que formatrices. Passant de la conceptualisation visuelle pour des campagnes publicitaires aux analyses minutieuses des performances de nos stratégies sur les réseaux sociaux, chaque tâche était un puzzle à résoudre, un objectif à atteindre. Un projet d'envergure fut la coordination de contenu pour une campagne LinkedIn ciblant une audience spécifique d'industrie. Il s'agissait de jongler entre la rigueur des données et l'inventivité nécessaire à la création de contenus originaux. La réflexion stratégique, alignée sur les objectifs marketing, m'a demandé de me plonger dans l'esprit du consommateur, d'anticiper ses besoins et de répondre à ses attentes par des messages clairs et engageants. **2.3 Résolution de Problèmes** La résolution de problèmes était l'exercice quotidien qui éprouvait ma patience et aiguisait mon intellect. Face à un imprévu, comme une impression d'affiche qui ne correspondait pas aux attentes ou une publication sur les réseaux sociaux confrontée à un feedback inattendu, ma capacité d'adaptation était mise à l'épreuve. Pour chaque écueil rencontré, une tempête d'idées foisonnait lors de séances de brainstorming effervescents. Il m'était demandé de sortir de ma zone de confort, de proposer des solutions et de les exécuter avec la précision d'un horloger. Le dialogue constant avec mes pairs et la hiérarchie permettait d'établir un plan d'action et de rectifier le tir avec agilité.

Les matins avaient une cadence rythmée par le cliquetis des machines à café et les salutations chaleureuses.

Les espaces communs étaient des lieux de rencontres impromptues, où idées et anecdotes se faisaient écho entre les murs. Ma place, bien que temporaire, se situait au cœur du département marketing. Ici, les discussions allaient bon train, oscillant entre analytiques de marché et créations de contenu. Chaque collègue était un mentor potentiel, chaque conversation, une leçon en devenir.

Ordinateurs performants, logiciels de pointe et applications de gestion de projets nous étaient fournis pour maximiser nos compétences. Chaque écran était une fenêtre sur un monde de possibilités, chaque clavier, un instrument me permettant de composer ma partition dans le grand orchestre de DXC. Les pauses se transformaient en moments de partage, où nous décompressions autour de jeux de société mis à disposition ou de discussions informelles dans la zone de détente. Ces interludes étaient comme de petites respirations au milieu de nos tâches, des sas de décompression nécessaires à notre santé mentale et à notre équilibre. DXC Technology Maroc accordait de l'importance au bien-être de ses employés. Des initiatives bien-être étaient régulièrement mises en place, qu'il s'agisse de séances de yoga hebdomadaires ou de paniers de fruits frais disponibles pour tous.

En tant qu'étudiant, j'étais assoiffé d'apprentissage et avide de me frotter à la réalité du terrain. Ma toute première tâche, celle qui reste gravée dans ma mémoire, a été de participer à la conception d'une campagne email. C'était l'occasion de mettre mes connaissances académiques à l'épreuve. Assis devant mon écran, j'ouvrais ma boîte à outils numérique et sélectionnais les meilleurs mots pour capter l'attention, tandis que je peaufinais le design pour qu'il soit à la fois séduisant et fonctionnel.

Coordonner avec les photographes, sélectionner les lieux et travailler avec les collègues pour capturer l'essence de DXC en image, cela ressemblait à diriger un petit film. J'apprenais sur le tas comment les détails esthétiques pouvaient communiquer la culture d'entreprise et comment une image pouvait valoir mille mots. La réalisation de tâches ne s’arrêtait pas là. J'ai également été impliqué dans la mise à jour hebdomadaire du tableau de bord des indicateurs clés de performance. Ce fut une mission cruciale qui a renforcé ma rigueur analytique. C'était comme résoudre un puzzle chaque semaine, décrypter ce que les chiffres avaient à « dire » et extrapoler des tendances qui pourraient influencer nos stratégies futures. Les rendez-vous client étaient un autre chapitre de mon parcours. M'y préparer, c'était comme réviser pour un examen. Je compulais des données, rédigeais des briefs, répétais des pitchs – tout cela pour assurer que l'image de DXC soit impeccablement présentée. Et puis, il y avait cette adrénaline lors de la rencontre réelle, où je devais jongler entre écoute active et communication efficace. L'une des tâches les plus stimulantes a été de contribuer à l'écriture de billets pour le blog de l'entreprise. Cela demandait non seulement une plume affûtée, mais aussi la capacité à plonger dans des sujets techniques et à les rendre digestes pour un public non-initié. Chaque article publié me remplissait d'une fierté grandissante, comme si chaque mot imprimé contribuait à bâtir ma propre voie dans le monde du marketing digital.

Cette diversité m'a permis de tisser une toile d'expériences, de compétences et de souvenirs qui resteront ancrés en moi bien au-delà de ces mois de stage. C'est cette réalisation quotidienne de tâches qui a peint la toile de ma vie de stagiaire. Ce n'était pas juste accomplir des missions, c'était une aventure, un véritable acte de croissance.

La ligne de démarcation entre le théorique appris sur les bancs de l'ISCAE et la pratique s'estompe rapidement, laissant place à une mise en application concrète de mes compétences. Le monde des campagnes email marketing fut l'une de mes premières arènes. J'étais chargé de l'élaboration de messages clairs et percutants, conçus pour optimiser l'engagement client. Chaque campagne constituait un défi stratégique, où un mélange judicieux de copywriting et de sélection visuelle devait susciter l'intérêt au sein d'une audience ciblée. Analyser les métriques post-envoi et ajuster les stratégies étaient des tâches routinières qui ont grandement contribué à affiner mon acuité analytique. L'organisation d'une séance photo institutionnelle pour actualiser le site web s'est révélée être un exercice de gestion de projet précis. Coordonner les différents intervenants, de la logistique à la direction artistique, tout en assurant la cohérence avec l'identité de marque, a exigé une attention particulière à la narration visuelle et un sens élevé de l'organisation.

Cependant, je peux vous fournir un modèle détaillé sur la résolution de problèmes pour débuter, que vous pouvez ensuite développer pour atteindre la longueur souhaitée. **2.3 Résolution de Problèmes** Chez DXC Technology Maroc, la résolution de problèmes n'était pas seulement une compétence attendue, c'était une philosophie intégrale à ma fonction de stagiaire. Les défis quotidiens étaient les catalyseurs de ma croissance personnelle et professionnelle, me stimulant à explorer et innover constamment pour trouver des solutions efficaces et créatives. **L'Approche Analytique** Chaque problème rencontré pouvait être perçu comme un puzzle complexe, et ma stratégie pour l'aborder se structurait autour d'une méthodologie systématique. Cela commençait par l'identification précise du problème. Plutôt que de réagir précipitamment, je prenais le temps de comprendre les mécanismes à l'œuvre et les facteurs contributifs. Cette étape initiale nécessitait une analyse minutieuse des données disponibles, des retours d'utilisateurs ou des commentaires internes pour délimiter les contours du problème avec précision. **La Réflexion Collective** Une fois le problème défini, s'ensuivait une phase collaborative. Chez DXC, l'intelligence collective était valorisée et mobilisée pour générer des solutions innovantes. Des brainstormings structurés étaient organisés, rassemblant des individus de diverses expertises. L'apport de perspectives multiples permettait d'élargir le champ des solutions possibles et d'harmoniser les approches. J'ai appris que des questions posées de façon ouverte et des dialogues constructifs étaient essentiels pour aboutir à des solutions concrètes. **La Créativité en Action** De ces sessions émergeaient des idées différentes, parfois atypiques. Mettre en œuvre ces solutions demandait de la créativité et de la flexibilité. Je me suis souvent retrouvé à l’intersection entre la créativité et la faisabilité, où je devais non seulement penser hors des sentiers battus, mais aussi assurer que les solutions étaient réalisables dans le contexte opérationnel de l'entreprise. **Le Processus d'Implémentation** L'implémentation de solutions était abordée avec rigueur. Chaque plan d'action était accompagné d'un échéancier, de ressources dédiées et d'indicateurs de suivi. Je me suis impliqué dans la mise en place de ces solutions, en suivant de près leur déploiement et en mesurant leur impact à travers des feedbacks et des indicateurs préétablis. **Le Feedback, Pivot de l'Amélioration** Le processus ne s'arrêtait pas une fois la solution implantée. Le feedback jouait un rôle capital. En collectant les réponses des utilisateurs finaux ou des parties prenantes internes, une boucle d'amélioration continue se mettait en place. Chaque retour d'expérience était une donnée précieuse pour ajuster, peaufiner ou même repenser les approches adoptées. **L’Adaptabilité en Pratique** La résolution de problèmes ne se passait pas toujours en ligne droite. Il y avait inévitablement des rebondissements, des adaptations nécessaires que je devais naviguer avec agilité. Que ce soit face à des contraintes technologiques imprévues ou à des changements au niveau des besoins clients, j'étais souvent amené à modifier ma trajectoire et à trouver de nouvelles solutions. **L'Impact Personnel et Collectif** En tant que stagiaire, l'expérience de résoudre des problèmes de manière proactive a été incroyablement valorisante. Elle a renforcé ma confiance en ma capacité à contribuer efficacement aux objectifs de l'entreprise et a solidifié mon esprit d'équipe. Chaque défi surmonté était une affirmation de ma valeur au sein de l'équipe et une consolidation de mon identité professionnelle. En conclusion, la résolution de problèmes chez DXC Technology était bien plus qu'une simple fonction opérationnelle. C'était une opportunité d'apprendre, de grandir et de laisser une empreinte constructive. Les leçons tirées de chaque problème ne se limitaient pas à des compétences techniques; elles façonnaient un état d'esprit résilient, adaptatif et innovant, préparant le terrain pour une carrière florissante dans le domaine de la technologie et du marketing.

You know you shouldn’t be attending club meetings at 7 months pregnant!” Natsuki: (sighs) “I know, Monika, but I can’t just miss out on everything. I want to be here with everyone.” Yuri: “I understand your enthusiasm, Natsuki, but it’s important to prioritize your health and the well-being of your daughter. Maybe taking a break would be beneficial for both of you?” Natsuki: “I’ve been feeling fine so far, and the doctor said it’s okay for me to continue my normal activities. I just need to take it easy.” Sayori: “Natsuki, I’m worried about you too. You’re important to us, and we want to make sure you and Sakura are doing well.” Natsuki: “Thank you, Sayori. I appreciate your concern, but I promise I’ll take care of myself. And besides, being here with all of you brings me joy and helps me relax.” Monika: “I understand that, Natsuki, but we also want you to prioritize your health. Maybe we can come up with a plan that allows you to still be involved in the club while also taking it easy.” Yuri: “That’s a good idea, Monika. We can delegate some tasks to Natsuki that don’t require too much physical exertion. That way, she can still participate and feel included without overexerting herself.” Natsuki: “That sounds fair. I don’t want to feel left out, but I also don’t want to put myself or Sakura at risk. Maybe I can help with organizing club events or handling some paperwork, things like that. As long as it doesn’t require too much physical effort, I think it should be fine.” Sayori: “That sounds like a good plan, Natsuki. We’ll make sure to distribute tasks evenly and ensure that you’re not overwhelmed. We’ll all be here to support you every step of the way.” Monika: “Absolutely. Your health and well-being are important to us, Natsuki. We want you to know that we value you and your contributions to the club, but we also want to make sure you and Sakura are taken care of.” Yuri: “Indeed. We can make some adjustments to our club activities and schedule to accommodate your needs. We’ll make sure you have enough rest and aren’t overwhelmed with responsibilities.” Natsuki: “Thank you, everyone. I really appreciate your understanding and support. I want to continue being an active member of this club, and I know I can rely on all of you to help me do that while still taking care of myself and Sakura.” Sayori: “Of course, Natsuki. We’re all in this together, and we’ll make sure you have the support and care you need. We’ll find a balance that works for everyone.” Natsuki: (her hands close to her belly) “Oh!” Monika: “Natsuki, what is it? Are you okay?” Natsuki: “I think Sakura just kicked! She’s an active little one, just like her momma.” Yuri: “That’s wonderful, Natsuki! It’s moments like these that make all the challenges worth it.” Sayori: “I’m so happy for you, Natsuki! It’s amazing to think that soon you’ll have a little bundle of joy in your arms.” Monika: “Indeed, Natsuki. This is such a special time for you, and we’ll make sure to create a supportive and positive environment for you and Sakura.” Yuri: “If there’s anything we can do to help, please let us know. Whether it’s researching baby care or just being there to talk and offer emotional support, we’re here for you.” Natsuki: “Thank you, everyone. It means a lot to me to have such wonderful friends. I know I can count on all of you during this exciting but also challenging time.” Sayori: “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’ll be here every step of the way, supporting you and cheering you on. Your journey into motherhood is something we all want to be a part of.” Monika: “And don’t forget, Natsuki, we can also plan a baby shower or special celebration for you and Sakura. It’ll be a fun and memorable way to show our love and support.” Natsuki: “That sounds amazing, Monika! I didn’t even think about that. It would be such a lovely gesture, and I know Sakura would appreciate it too.” Yuri: “We’ll start brainstorming ideas right away, Natsuki. We want to make sure it’s a beautiful and memorable celebration for you and your baby.” Sayori: “Oh, and we can also share our favorite children’s books with you, Natsuki! We can start a mini library for Sakura and help you find the best ones.” Natsuki: “That’s such a sweet idea, Sayori! I would love that. Thank you all for being so thoughtful and caring. I couldn’t ask for better friends.” Monika: “We feel the same way about you, Natsuki. You’re an important member of this club, and we want to support you in every way we can.” Yuri: “We’ll make sure you’re not just an active member of the club, but also a cherished friend and mother. We’re here for all of it.” Sayori: “Absolutely! So, Natsuki, are you ready to embark on this beautiful journey with us? A journey filled with literature, friendship, and the joy of motherhood?” Natsuki: (smiling) “I’m ready, Sayori. Let’s make it a truly unforgettable experience.” (That night, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (lying in bed, caressing her belly) “There, there, Sakura. We had such a wonderful day at the club today, didn’t we? I can already tell you’re going to love it just as much as I do. And with the support of Monika, Yuri, and Sayori, I know we’ll be able to navigate this journey together. I can’t wait to meet you, my little miracle. I love you so much already. Sweet dreams, little one.” (As Natsuki drifts off to sleep, filled with excitement and love for her unborn child, she dreams of a future where Sakura grows up surrounded by the warmth and support of her literature club family. They continue to share their love for literature, with Natsuki reading her favorite childhood stories to Sakura and teaching her the beauty of poetry. However, as she is sleeping, Natsuki feels a sharp pain in her abdomen and wakes up in a panic.) Natsuki: (groaning in pain) “Ow, what’s happening? Sakura, are you okay?” (She tries to get up, but the pain intensifies, and she realizes what’s happening - she was experiencing preterm contractions. Panicking, Natsuki tries to reach for her phone, but the pain only intensifies. Minutes go by, and the contractions grow stronger. And as her water breaks, she knows active premature labor had begun.) Natsuki: (through tears) “Help…I need help…” (Natsuki tries to endure the urge to","output":"push, but the pain becomes unbearable. She manages to grab her phone and dials for emergency services.)

Stay on the line with me, and try to stay as calm as possible. Can you tell me if there’s anyone else with you?” Natsuki: (crying) “No… I’m alone…” Operator: “Okay, ma’am. We’ll do our best to guide you through this. First, try to find a clean towel or clothing to support your baby’s head as it emerges. Gently push with the contractions, but don’t strain too hard. Just try to keep yourself as comfortable as possible. Help is on the way.” (Natsuki follows the operator's instructions, tears streaming down her face as the pain continues to ravage her body. She takes deep breaths and does her best to comply, hoping that help arrives in time.) Operator: “Ma’am, can you tell me if you have any medical conditions or allergies? Do you have any history of preterm birth or complications?” Natsuki: (struggling to speak) “No… no complications… healthy pregnancy…” Operator: “Good to hear. Just keep pushing, Natsuki. You’re doing great. Now, do you have any towels or blankets nearby to keep the baby warm once they’re delivered?” Natsuki: (gasping) “Yes… just a few feet away…” Operator: “Great, Natsuki. Keep them within reach, and once the baby is out, dry them gently and wrap them in a blanket to keep them warm.” (As Natsuki continues to push through the pain, a mix of fear and determination fuels her. She remembers the support and love she received from her fellow club members earlier in the day. With each contraction, she finds strength in knowing that her baby's future depends on her perseverance.) Natsuki: (gritting her teeth) “Almost there… just a little more…” Operator: “I can hear the determination in your voice, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing. Just a few more pushes, and your baby will be in your arms. Remember to keep yourself calm and focused.” (As Natsuki pushes with all her might, the sound of sirens grows closer. Soon, the door bursts open, and paramedics rush in to assist her.) Paramedic: “We’re here, ma’am. We’ll take it from here. Just keep pushing, and we’ll help deliver your baby safely.” (Natsuki feels a wave of relief as she hands over the responsibility to the paramedics. Tears of both pain and gratitude fill her eyes as she finally lets herself be carried away by the chaos and urgency of the situation. The sweet sound of her baby’s first cries echoes throughout the room, filling her with a mixture of joy and relief.) Natsuki: (whispering) “Welcome to the world, Sakura… You’re finally here…” (Far from the tranquility of her dreams, Natsuki finds herself surrounded by the chaos and uncertainty of an unexpected premature birth. Yet, she clings onto hope, knowing that both she and Sakura are fighters. With the support of her literature club family and the medical professionals by her side, Natsuki begins a new and challenging chapter in her journey as a mother.)"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Скажи пожалуйста размер боковой стороны УАЗ буханка в квадратных метрах и пагонных метрах.","output":"Приветствую! УАЗ «Буханка» (официальное наименование — УАЗ-452) — это легендарный советский и российский микроавтобус/грузовик, который производится Ульяновским автозаводом. Точные размеры боковой стороны УАЗ «Буханка» могут немного варьироваться в зависимости от модификации и года выпуска. Однако приблизительные размеры можно рассчитать следующим образом: Длина УАЗ-452 составляет примерно 4,6 метра (исключая передние и задние выступы), высота около 2,05 метра (без учета колес). Если мы рассматриваем прямоугольную поверхность боковой панели, мы можем приблизительно рассчитать площадь следующим образом: Площадь (S) = Длина (L) × Высота (H) Где L — длина боковой панели, а H — высота боковой панели. Приблизительный расчет: S ≈ 4,6 м × 2,05 м = 9,43 м² Погонные метры обычно относятся к длине изделия. Если вам нужно узнать длину боковой стороны в погонных метрах, то это будет приблизительно равно 4,6 метра. Обратите внимание, что это очень приблизительные расчеты и нужно учитывать различные выступы, изгибы и углубления. Чтобы получить точные данные, рекомендуется замерить боковую панель автомобиля непосредственно или обратиться к технической документации модели."},{"instruction":"А если вычесть кабину? Мне нужно сделать щит рекламу.

Обычно грузовая часть находится за кабиной водителя и пассажиров. Допустим, что кабина занимает около 1 метра в длину (это очень приблизительно, точная длина варьируется в зависимости от модели и должна быть замерена). Тогда длина рекламного щита для грузовой части будет составлять: Приблизительная длина грузовой части (Lгруз) = Общая длина автомобиля (Lобщ) - Длина кабины (Lкаб) Используя ранее указанную приблизительную длину автомобиля 4,6 метра и предполагаемую длину кабины 1 метр, мы получим: Lгруз ≈ 4,6 м - 1 м = 3,6 м Площадь (Sгруз) = Длина грузовой части (Lгруз) × Высота боковой части (H) Если принять высоту боковой стороны (без колес) за 2 метра для удобства расчетов: Sгруз ≈ 3,6 м × 2 м = 7,2 м² Приблизительная длина рекламного щита в погонных метрах будет равна длине грузовой части, то есть около 3,6 метра. Обратите внимание, что данные значения являются оценочными, и для точных расчетов вам нужно самостоятельно замерить интересующие размеры на вашем автомобиле или воспользоваться конкретными техническими чертежами модели УАЗ \\"Буханки\\", на которой вы планируете разместить рекламу."},{"instruction":"Сколько стержней влезет уложенных в один ряд по горизонтали и второй вариант по вертикали керамической арматуры диаметром 17,5.","output":"Чтобы определить количество стержней керамической арматуры диаметром 17,5 мм, которые могут уместиться в грузовой части УАЗ \\"Буханки\\", нам нужно знать размеры грузовой части. Примем для примера, что боковая панель (длина грузовой части) составляет примерно 3,6 метров в длину и 2 метра в высоту (исключая кабину и колеса, как мы обсуждали ранее). Горизонтальное размещение (вдоль длины грузовой части): Количество стержней (Горизонтально) = Длина грузовой части / Диаметр стержня Количество стержней (Горизонтально) ≈ 3,6 м / 0,0175 м ≈ 205,71 Так как стержни должны быть разделены наличием пространства между собой, их количество будет чуть меньше. Если округлить в меньшую сторону, то можно разместить примерно 205 стержней в один ряд вдоль длины. Вертикальное размещение (поперек высоты грузовой части): Количество стержней (Вертикально) = Высота грузовой части / Диаметр стержня Количество стержней (Вертикально) ≈ 2 м / 0,0175 м ≈ 114,29 При вертикальном размещении, также учитывая необходимость пространства между стержнями, округлим в меньшую сторону и получим, что можно уложить примерно 114 стержней. Помните, что на практике количество уложенных стержней может изменяться в зависимости от того, каким образом будет учитываться место для связывания и других факторов. Также важно учесть, что в реальных условиях стержни не будут уложены вплотную друг к другу, и необходимо будет предусмотреть место для удобства загрузки и разгрузки, чтобы избежать повреждений арматуры или самого грузового отделения автомобиля."},{"instruction":"Не понял если высота 2м а длина 3,6 то разве там там столько стержней.

Если рассматривать установку керамической арматуры диаметром 17,5 мм на внешнюю сторону УАЗ \\"Буханки\\", и стержни будут укладываться вплотную друг к другу, то рассчёт будет следующим: Горизонтальное размещение (вдоль длины грузовой части 3,6 метра): Диаметр стержня: 17,5 мм или 0,0175 метра. Количество стержней (Горизонтально) = Длина грузовой части / Диаметр стержня Количество стержней (Горизонтально) = 3,6 м / 0,0175 м ≈ 205,71 Значит, в горизонтальном размещении вплотную друг к другу поместится примерно 205 стержней (округляя в меньшую сторону). Вертикальное размещение (по высоте грузовой части 2 метра): Количество стержней (Вертикально) = Высота грузовой части / Диаметр стержня Количество стержней (Вертикально) = 2 м / 0,0175 м ≈ 114,29 В вертикальном размещении вплотную друг к другу получается примерно 114 стержней (округляя в меньшую сторону). Таким образом, если укладывать стержни горизонтально (вдоль длины), поместится до 205 стержней. Если же укладывать вертикально (по высоте), то поместится около 114 стержней. При установке стержней вплотную друг к другу следует также учитывать возможные неровности и выступы на поверхности, которые могут немного уменьшить количество стержней, которые реально поместятся."},{"instruction":"Керамическая арматура продаётся в пагонных метрах можешь сам проверить даже это. Сколько это в погонных метрах.","output":"Извините за недоразумение в предыдущих ответах. Давайте разберемся с понятием погонных метров для стержней керамической арматуры. 1 погонный метр представляет собой длину в один метр одного стержня, независимо от его диаметра. При горизонтальном укладывании вдоль боковой стороны кузова УАЗ \\"Буханки\\" длиной 3,6 метра, один слой стержней керамической арматуры даст вам 3,6 погонных метра, поскольку каждый стержень занимает горизонтальное пространство, равное его длине. Это если рассматривать стержни, уложенные рядом друг с другом без зазоров. При вертикальном укладывании в высоту вдоль боковой стороны кузова высотой 2 метра, один слой стержней даст вам 2 погонных метра. Однако цифры, данные ранее, показывают, сколько именно стержней диаметром 17,5 мм вы можете уложить в один ряд, при условии, что они уложены вплотную. Погонные метры для нескольких стержней: - Если уложить 205 стержней по горизонтали, то получится 205 погонных метров в один ряд. - Если уложить 114 стержней по вертикали, то получится 114 погонных метров в один ряд. Таким образом, если рассматривать укладку стержней арматуры на боковой стороне УАЗ \\"Буханки\\" и вас интересует общее количество погонных метров, то оно будет равно количеству стержней, которое вы можете уложить в один ряд."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن طريقة تحميل من يوتيوب","output":"تحميل الفيديوهات من موقع اليوتيوب أصبح أمرًا شائعًا بين المستخدمين في الآونة الأخيرة، فمع تزايد الطلب على مشاهدة الفيديوهات دون الحاجة للاتصال بالإنترنت، أصبحت هناك حاجة ماسة إلى معرفة الطرق المناسبة لتحميل الفيديوهات من اليوتيوب. في هذا المقال، سأقدم لكم بعض الطرق الشائعة والمفيدة لتحميل مقاطع الفيديو من اليوتيوب. 1. استخدام مواقع الخدمات المجانية: هناك العديد من المواقع التي تتيح لكم تحميل الفيديوهات من اليوتيوب بسهولة وبشكل مجاني. يُقدم بعض هذه المواقع خدمة تحويل الروابط فقط، في حين توفر البعض الآخر إمكانية تحميل صيغ مختلفة للفيديوهات. 2. تطبيقات التحميل: يوجد العديد من التطبيقات المتاحة للهواتف الذكية وأجهزة الكمبيوتر التي توفر لكم خاصية تحميل الفيديوهات من اليوتيوب. معظم هذه التطبيقات يُمكنك تحميلها مباشرة من متجر التطبيقات الخاص بنظام التشغيل الخاص بجهازك. 3. الاستخدام الموسع للمتصفحات الإضافية: هناك العديد من المتصفحات المتاحة التي تتيح لكم تنزيل الفيديوهات من اليوتيوب من خلال إضافات يتم تثبيتها على المتصفح. فيمكنك البحث عن هذه الإضافات في صفحة متجر التطبيقات التابع لكل متصفح. ومع ذلك، عليك أن تتذكر أن تحميل مقاطع الفيديو من اليوتيوب قد ينتهك حقوق النشر وقوانين الملكية الفكرية. لذلك، يجب أن تتأكد من الامتثال للقوانين والتراخيص المناسبة قبل تنزيل أي محتوى من اليوتيوب. باختصار، هناك العديد من الطرق المتاحة لتحميل مقاطع الفيديو من اليوتيوب، سواء كانت مواقع خدمات مجانية أو تطبيقات على الهواتف الذكية أو المتصفحات المتاحة للكمبيوتر. ومع ذلك، يجب أن تتأكد دائمًا من الامتثال للحقوق الملكية الفكرية والتراخيص قبل تحميل أي محتوى من اليوتيوب."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How to assess if 3 years old boy for gastroenteritis need iv fluids or ors","output":"As a general practitioner, when assessing a 3-year-old boy with gastroenteritis to determine if intravenous (IV) fluids or oral rehydration solution (ORS) is needed, you should consider the following approach: 1. **Hydration Status:** Check the child’s hydration status. Signs of dehydration to look for include: - Dry mucous membranes - Decreased skin turgor - Sunken eyes - Diminished urine output (fewer wet diapers or less frequent urination) - Lethargy or irritability - Rapid heart rate - Low blood pressure (more difficult to assess in a young child) 2. **Severity of Symptoms:** Evaluate the severity and frequency of the symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. Frequent, large-volume watery diarrhea or persistent vomiting may indicate a higher risk of dehydration and the need for IV fluids. 3. **Ability to Tolerate Oral Intake:** Assess the child's ability to take and retain oral fluids. If the child can drink and keep ORS down, this is usually preferable to IV fluids. 4. **Clinical Guidelines:** Use clinical guidelines and assessment tools like the World Health Organization (WHO) dehydration assessment chart or the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines to help in your evaluation. 5. **Parental Assessment and Social Factors:** Consider the parents' assessment of their child's usual behavior and fluid intake, as well as their ability to continue oral rehydration at home. Social factors such as access to healthcare if the child's condition were to deteriorate should be considered. 6. **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Be aware of any underlying medical conditions that could affect the child's ability to compensate for dehydration or increase the risk of complications. Based on the assessment: - **Mild Dehydration:** The child can likely be managed with ORS at home, with instructions for the parents for adequate fluid replacement and signs to monitor for in case the situation should worsen. - **Moderate Dehydration:** The child still may be managed with ORS, but the situation should be monitored more closely. You may recommend a short stay in an outpatient setting or ED visit depending upon the clinical scenario and parental capacity to manage. - **Severe Dehydration or Shock:** IV fluid resuscitation should be initiated promptly, often in an emergency department or hospital setting. The decision between ORS and IV fluids in the management of dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis is made on a case-by-case basis, using clinical judgment and by evaluating the above considerations. It's also important to remember to address the underlying cause of the gastroenteritis and recommend appropriate interventions to aid in the child's recovery, such as proper hygiene measures, potential dietary adjustments, and the use of zinc supplementation where appropriate."},{"instruction":"Let's write a blog post that will rank on Google.

This unusual and darkly humorous thriller film features Priscilla Druin, a beautiful, assertive young woman. Write long, original, interesting and imaginative scene. In it, Priscilla is lying in her bed, in the room of the clinic. She is being questioned by two high-ranking detectives, imposing Basil Bends and spider-like Percival Gleswick. Priscilla is rejecting the accusations against her fiance, Tristan Boorsma. She argues that it would make sense for Tristan to wait for their wedding, if he was intending to murder Priscilla, so that he would inherit her money. Bends and Gleswick, however, keep asking Priscilla questions and doubting her own part in the whole affair. Priscilla then says she feels very tired now and wants to rest. She then sees how suspicious she looks saying this, as if trying to avoid questioning, but she claims she is genuinely weak. Bends and Gleswick leave, but promise to be back. Luciana Vipari, a beautiful and talkative young nurse, helps Priscilla to get comfortable, lowering her bed and putting an oxygen mask on her. As she leaves, Priscilla tries to sleep, but seems too preoccupied with the mystery, apparently not too debilitated by her weakness anymore. She raises herself up in bed and takes her notebook from the pillow, starting to delve into her own notes and trying to find any answers there.","output":"INT. CLINIC ROOM - NIGHT The room is dimly lit, with Priscilla Druin, an alluring and determined young woman, lying on the hospital bed. Her eyes are focused, her posture poised. She stares intently at two high-ranking detectives, Basil Bends and Percival Gleswick, standing by her bedside. They exude an air of authority, their presence imposing. Priscilla: (firmly) I'm telling you, Detective Bends, Tristan couldn't have done this. It makes no sense for him to murder me before our wedding. He'd gain access to my wealth if he waits! Detective Gleswick: (leaning in, slyly) Ah, Ms. Druin, perhaps that’s exactly what he wants us to believe. A cunning strategy to divert suspicion. Priscilla: (exasperated) But that's preposterous! Tristan loves me. He's been planning this wedding for months. He wouldn't jeopardize it by killing me. Detective Bends: (leaning against the wall, skeptically) We understand your loyalty, Ms. Druin, but we need to consider all possibilities. Killers come in all shapes and sizes, even those closest to us. Priscilla's frustration grows, but she remains composed. Priscilla: If Tristan were the culprit, why would he raise suspicions by proposing? He knew the moment he did that, he would be under the microscope. It's illogical! Detective Gleswick: (leaning over Priscilla) We’re not ruling anything out yet, Miss Druin. Circumstances can be deceiving. People have motives beyond comprehension. Priscilla sighs, acknowledging defeat. She tries to look weak and desperate. Priscilla: (wearily) I can't handle this questioning anymore. I feel so tired. Can I please rest?

Detectives Bends and Gleswick exit the room, leaving Priscilla alone. She releases a breath she didn't realize she was holding. Luciana Vipari, a lively and chatty nurse, enters the room with a gentle smile. Luciana: (sweetly) How are you feeling, dear? Can I help you get more comfortable? Priscilla: (weakly) Thank you, Luciana. If you could lower the bed a little and put the oxygen mask on, that would be wonderful.

[극도의 정신력] [등급] S [효과] 체력이 완전히 바닥났을 때, 극도의 정신력을 발휘하며 많은 시간 더 뛸 수 있게 됩니다. 특성의 효과가 발휘될 때, 컨디션이 매우 좋아집니다. [완벽한 신체] [등급] A [효과] 신체 밸런스와 힘, 운동능력, 몸싸움이 놀라울 정도로 좋아지고, 어지간해선 다치지 않게 됩니다. “미쳤네.” 미쳤다라는 말이 절로 나왔다. 그만큼 성장한 특성들의 효과는 좋아 보였다. “상대 수비수들이 놀라겠는데?” 아직 직접 확인하진 않았지만, 특성의 등급을 봤을 때 효과는 분명 강력할 게 분명했다. 이제 신재욱을 상대하게 될 상대인 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비수들은 놀랄 수밖에 없다. 신재욱의 실력이 갑자기 더 좋아질 테니까. ― 경기가 재개됩니다! 바이에른 뮌헨은 단단한 경기 운영을 이어갔다. 선제골을 넣은 이상 급할 게 없었다. 반면 아틀레티코 마드리드는 계속해서 공격적인 운영을 이어갔다. “좋지 않아.” 디에고 시메오네 감독의 표정이 어두웠다. 경기의 내용이 마음에 들지 않았다. 애초에 그와 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들이 준비한 전략은 전반전에 1골을 넣고, 후반전엔 원래의 수비 전술로 버티는 것이었는데 초반부터 꼬여버렸다. “신재욱 하나로 모든 게 꼬여버렸어.” 후우! 디에고 시메오네 감독은 한숨을 내쉬며 신재욱을 바라봤다. “저 녀석이 잘하는 건 알았지만……이렇게나 특별할 줄이야.” 기습적으로 몸을 돌리며 슈팅을 때리고, 그 슈팅으로 골을 넣는 신재욱의 모습을 봤을 때. 디에고 시메오네 감독은 팔에 소름이 돋았었다. 다른 선수도 아닌, 디에고 고딘을 상대하면서 만들어낸 골이었기 때문이었다. “디에고 고딘은 라리가 최고 수준의 수비수인데……디에고 코스타나 다비드 비야도 고딘을 저렇게 뚫어내지 못하는데…….” 디에고 고딘이 어떤 수비수인가. 유명세는 덜하지만, 세계적인 실력을 지닌 수비수다. 187cm라는 큰 키를 이용한 헤더 능력이 대단하고, 피지컬은 뛰어나지 않지만 수비 능력이 엄청난 선수다. 절대 쉽게 뚫릴 만한 선수가 아니라는 것이다. 그런데 신재욱에겐 너무나도 쉽게 뚫린 것처럼 보였다. 시메오네 감독은 그 원인을 알았다. “신재욱은 심리전을 굉장히 잘해. 계속해서 포스트 플레이만 하면서 디에고 고딘을 익숙하게 만든 다음, 갑자기 다른 플레이를 했어. 저 녀석…… 얄미울 정도로 영리하기까지 해.” 후우! 디에고 시메오네 감독의 입에서 다시 한번 한숨이 흘러나왔다. 아무래도 오늘 경기가 쉽지 않을 것 같다는 느낌이 강하게 들었다. ― 아틀레티코 마드리드의 공격이 처음보다는 좀 소극적인 것 같죠? ― 그렇습니다! 측면에 있는 윙어들이 적극적으로 돌파 시도를 할 필요가 있어 보입니다! 전술상 아틀레티코 마드리드의 공격이 잘 통하려면 측면공격이 살아나야 하거든요? ― 아무래도 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들이 선제골을 허용한 이후에 위축된 것 같습니다. 바이에른 뮌헨은 역습에도 강한 팀이고, 만약 또다시 실점하게 된다면 최악의 상황이 되는 것이거든요! 공격에 신중해질 수밖에 없죠. 해설들의 말처럼 아틀레티코 마드리드는 과감한 공격을 시도하지 못했다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습을 경계하다 보니, 신중하게 공을 돌리며 완벽한 기회를 찾으려고 했다. 그러나 바이에른 뮌헨이 어떤 팀이던가. 시즌 내내 단단한 경기력으로 분데스리가 무패 우승이라는 업적을 달성한 팀이었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비가 굉장히 좋은데요? 아틀레티코 마드리드가 계속해서 틈을 만들어보려고 하지만 빈틈이 보이질 않습니다! ― 지금 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들을 보시면 각자 맡은 지역을 철저하게 막아 주고 있거든요? 조금은 불안할 수 있는 측면은 프랑크 리베리 선수와 토마스 뮐러 선수가 수비 가담을 해주면서 도움을 주고 있고요. 이러면 아틀레티코 마드리드로서는 더욱 뚫기 어렵죠! 바이에른 뮌헨은 빈틈을 주지 않았다. 물론 빈틈이 아예 없진 않았지만, 경기장에서 뛰는 선수들에겐 찾기 힘든 정도였다. 결국, 유효슈팅을 만들지 못한 채 아틀레티코 마드리드는 공을 뺏겨버렸다. 공을 뺏긴 순간 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들의 표정이 일그러졌다. 이들의 공격을 끊어낸 선수가 수비수도 아니고 공격수였으니까. ― 신재욱 선수의 태클입니다! 이야! 정말 아름다운 태클이네요! 가비 선수가 패스하려던 순간에 과감하게 슬라이딩 태클을 시도했는데, 이게 또 정확히 공만 빼냈습니다! ― 신재욱 선수의 슬라이딩 태클은 날이 갈수록 더 완벽해지는 것 같습니다! 정말 상대가 두려워할 수밖에 없는 무기네요! 깔끔한 태클로 공을 뺏어낸 신재욱은 근처에 있는 동료에게 패스했다. 아직 몸을 일으키지 못한 자신보단, 역습할 준비가 되어있는 동료에게 공을 주는 게 나았으니까. “바스티안!” 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거가 몸을 돌리며 패스를 받았다. 공을 받는 것과 동시에 다시 뿌려줄 수 있게끔 각을 만든 것이었다. 그의 시야엔 보였다. 최전방으로 총알처럼 뛰어나가는 이택현의 모습이. 퍼엉! 슈바인슈타이거의 발이 공을 차 냈다. 좋은 패스 능력을 지닌 선수답게, 공은 정확하게 전방으로 뻗어 나갔다. 그리고 이택현은 날아오는 공을 어렵지 않게 받아냈다. ― 이택현 선수! 완벽한 침투입니다! 골키퍼와의 일대일 상황! 너무나도 좋은 기회입니다! ― 이건 넣어줘야죠! 높은 확률로 골을 넣을 좋은 기회였다. 아직 나이가 어린 이택현은 흥분했지만, 슈팅을 시도하는 움직임만큼은 침착했다. 그는 타고난 재능과 수많은 훈련으로 만들어진 완벽한 슈팅을 때려냈다. 라리가 최고의 골키퍼 중 하나인 쿠르투아를 앞에 둔 상황이었지만, 이택현은 오로지 자신이 할 것에만 집중했다. ― 고오오오오오오오올! 이택현 선수의 골입니다! 스코어를 2 대 0으로 만드는 골! 아~! 아틀레티코 마드리드가 챔피언스리그 결승에서 무너지나요? ― 세계 최고의 수비력을 가졌다는 아틀레티코 마드리드지만, 지금처럼 공격하는 상황에서 역습을 허용하면 어찌할 도리가 없죠! 게다가 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습이 너무 완벽했습니다! ― 이러면 아틀레티코 마드리드가 더 말리겠는데요? 선수들의 멘탈이 많이 흔들릴 것 같습니다! 이택현의 골이 터진 지금. 그 모습을 보던 신재욱은 시선 돌려 자신의 몸을 바라봤다. “역시 좋아졌어.” 가비의 공을 태클로 끊어내고 슈바인슈타이거에게 공을 넘겨줄 때. 평소와는 느낌이 달랐다. 몸의 중심이 더 잘 잡혀있는 느낌이 들었고, 머리로 생각했던 움직임이 실제로도 잘 구현됐다. 운동신경 자체가 좋아진 듯한 느낌이었다. 신재욱은 그 이유를 알고 있었다. [완벽한 신체] [등급] A [효과] 신체 밸런스와 힘, 운동능력, 몸싸움이 놀라울 정도로 좋아지고, 어지간해선 다치지 않게 됩니다. “효과가 확실하네.” 선제골을 넣었을 때, 경이로운 신체(B) 특성이 성장하며 얻게 된 완벽한 신체(A) 특성의 효과 덕이었다. “이러니 특성이 성장하면 기분이 좋을 수밖에 없다니까.” 신재욱은 씨익 웃은 뒤, 다시 시선을 돌렸다. 저 멀리서 동료들에게 축하를 받는 이택현의 모습이 보였다. “그나저나 쟤, 실력이 더 늘었네.” * * * 2 대 0 스코어가 됐지만, 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 방심하지 않았다. 아직 전반전이었기에 경기는 언제든지 역전될 수도 있다는 걸 알았으니까. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 경기를 정말 잘 풀어나가네요. 2 대 0으로 앞서고 있음에도 선수들이 전혀 욕심을 부리지 않고 안정적으로 움직이고 있습니다. ― 이러면 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들은 답답해지겠는데요? 이 팀은 역습을 즐기는 팀인데, 바이에른 뮌헨이 라인을 내리고 있으니까 역습 기회가 생기질 않고 있습니다. 게다가 측면도 뚫리질 않고 있고요. ― 아틀레티코 마드리드는 지금 같은 상황을 타개하려면 중거리 슈팅을 과감하게 시도할 필요가 있어 보입니다. 또 측면보단 중앙으로도 전진 패스를 넣어야만 합니다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습이 무섭더라도, 골을 넣으려면 도전을 해야만 하거든요? 경기장엔 디에고 시메오네 감독의 호통이 끊이질 않았다. 그는 위축된 선수들에게 자신감을 가지라며 소리를 질러댔다. 워낙 카리스마가 넘치는 감독이었기에, 아틀레티코 마드리드의 선수들은 즉시 반응했다. 위축된 마음을 억지로라도 이겨내려고 노력하며 보다 더 적극적인 공격을 시도했다. 하지만 결과는 좋지 않았다. 신재욱 때문이었다. ― 우오오오오오! 이번에도 신재욱입니다! 신재욱 선수가 환상적인 슬라이딩 태클로 아틀레티코 마드리드의 공격을 끊어냈습니다! 레알 마드리드와의 경기에서 그랬던 것처럼. 크리스티아누 호날두, 카림 벤제마, 루카 모드리치, 가레스 베일에게 그랬던 것처럼. 신제욱은 아틀레티코 마드리드가 중요한 전진 패스를 시도하려고 할 때, 슬라이딩 태클을 했다. 상대의 공격을 완벽한 타이밍에 끊어내는 태클이었다. ‘확실히 운동능력이랑 신체 밸런스가 좋아졌어.’ 슬라이딩 태클로 공을 뺏어낸 신재욱이 부드러운 움직임으로 몸을 일으켰다. 그 움직임은 매우 빨랐다. ‘이 정도면 직접 공을 몰고 나가도 되겠는데?’ 주변을 확인한 신재욱이 미소를 지었다. 상대 선수들의 위치가 좋지 않았다. 적극적으로 공격을 하느라 수비수들의 숫자도 적었다. 기술에 자신이 있는 선수라면 드리블 욕심이 날 수밖에 없는 상황이었다. ‘해보지 뭐.’ 조금 더 좋은 위치에서 움직이는 동료들의 모습이 보였지만. 신재욱은 지금만큼은 직접 도전하기로 결정을 내렸다. 투욱! 공을 앞으로 밀어내며 속도를 높였다. ― 신재욱 선수가 전진합니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습이 이번에도 신재욱 선수로부터 시작됩니다!","output":"181 --- [Speed has increased by 1!] [Heading has increased by 1!] [Pressure resistance has increased by 1!] [Attributes have grown!] ['Top Mental Strength (A)' has grown into 'Extreme Mental Strength (S)'!] [Attributes have grown!] ['Wonderful Physique (B)' has grown into 'Perfect Physique (A)'!] Messages indicating that stats have increased and attributes have grown. Seeing several messages pop up, not just one, Shin Jaewook smiled. \\"Yeah, it should be like this for the Champions League final.\\" Even as Shin Jaewook ran to the center of the field with the ball, he glanced at the messages again with his eyes. \\"I didn't expect my speed to increase, but it finally has.\\" He was pleased that his heading and pressure resistance stats had increased, but the message about the speed increase was the most welcome. It was the stat that had been the hardest to improve. Moreover, his speed stat was now 85. Even among professional players, this was a respectable speed stat. 'I haven't been hearing that I'm slow lately, but I haven't heard that I'm fast either. Maybe now I'll be able to hear that I'm on the faster side.' When he was almost at the center of the field, Shin Jaewook looked at the information of his grown attributes as he placed the ball on the ground. [Extreme Mental Strength] [Grade] S [Effect] When stamina is completely depleted, you can exert extreme mental strength and run for a much longer time. When the attribute's effect is activated, your condition improves significantly. [Perfect Physique] [Grade] A [Effect] Your body balance, strength, athletic ability, and physicality improve remarkably, and you become less likely to get injured. \\"Crazy.\\" The word 'crazy' slipped out naturally. The effects of the grown attributes seemed very good. \\"The opposing defenders will be surprised, won't they?\\" He hadn't checked directly yet, but judging by the grade of the attributes, the effects were clearly going to be powerful. The defenders of Atlético Madrid, who would now face Shin Jaewook, would undoubtedly be surprised. Shin Jaewook's skills had suddenly improved. ― The game resumes! Bayern Munich continued with solid game management. Having scored the opening goal, there was no rush. On the other hand, Atlético Madrid continued with an aggressive approach. \\"This isn't good.\\" Coach Diego Simeone's expression was dark. He was not pleased with the flow of the game. The strategy prepared by him and the Atlético Madrid players was to score a goal in the first half and then hold out with their original defensive tactics in the second half, but things had gone awry from the start. \\"Everything's been messed up because of Shin Jaewook.\\" Sigh! Coach Diego Simeone sighed as he looked at Shin Jaewook. \\"I knew that guy was good... but I didn't expect him to be this special.\\" When he saw Shin Jaewook turn his body unexpectedly to shoot and score a goal, Coach Simeone had felt chills on his arms. It was a goal made against Diego Godín, no less. \\"Diego Godín is one of the best defenders in La Liga... Even Diego Costa and David Villa couldn't break through Godín like that...\\" Who is Diego Godín? He may not be as famous, but he's a world-class defender. He's great with headers due to his height of 187 cm, and although not physically imposing, his defensive abilities are tremendous. He's not a player who can be easily breached. But to Shin Jaewook, it seemed all too easy. Coach Simeone knew the reason. \\"Shin Jaewook is very good at psychological warfare. He kept doing post plays to make Diego Godín comfortable, then suddenly switched it up. That guy... is annoyingly clever.\\" Sigh! Another sigh escaped from Coach Diego Simeone's mouth. He had a strong feeling that today's game would not be easy. ― Atlético Madrid's attack seems a bit more passive than before, doesn't it? ― Yes! The wingers on the sides need to actively attempt to break through! For Atlético Madrid's attack to work well tactically, the side attacks need to come alive, right? ― It seems that the Atlético Madrid players have become intimidated after conceding the opening goal. Bayern Munich is also strong on the counterattack, and if they concede another goal, it would be the worst-case scenario! They have to be cautious in their attacks. As the commentators said, Atlético Madrid could not attempt bold attacks. Wary of Bayern Munich's counterattacks, they circulated the ball cautiously, looking for the perfect opportunity. But what kind of team was Bayern Munich? They were a team that had achieved the feat of an undefeated Bundesliga championship with solid gameplay throughout the season. ― Bayern Munich's defense is really good, isn't it? Atlético Madrid keeps trying to create openings, but there are no gaps! ― If you look at the Bayern Munich players now, they are thoroughly blocking their assigned areas, right? The slightly vulnerable sides are being helped by players like Franck Ribéry and Thomas Müller joining in on defense. This makes it even harder for Atlético Madrid to break through! Bayern Munich did not give any openings. Of course, there were no absolute gaps, but for the players on the field, they were hard to find. In the end, unable to create effective shots, Atlético Madrid lost possession of the ball. The expressions of the Atlético Madrid players twisted the moment they lost the ball. The player who had cut off their attack was not a defender but a forward. ― It's a tackle by Shin Jaewook! Wow! What a beautiful tackle! He boldly attempted a sliding tackle just as Gabi was about to pass, and he managed to cleanly take the ball away! ― Shin Jaewook's sliding tackles seem to be getting more perfect by the day! It's truly a weapon that the opposition must fear! After cleanly tackling and taking the ball, Shin Jaewook passed it to a nearby teammate. It was better to give the ball to a teammate who was ready for a counterattack than to himself, who had not yet stood up. \\"Bastian!\\" Bastian Schweinsteiger turned and received the pass. As he received the ball, he positioned himself to pass it forward again. He saw it. The sight of Lee Taekhyun sprinting forward like a bullet. Boom! Schweinsteiger's foot struck the ball. True to his reputation as a player with good passing ability, the ball stretched accurately forward. And Lee Taekhyun easily received the flying ball. ― Lee Taekhyun! A perfect breakthrough! A one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper! Such a great opportunity! ― This has to be a goal! It was a high-probability chance to score a goal. Although young and excited, Lee Taekhyun's movements as he attempted the shot were calm. He unleashed a perfect shot, honed by innate talent and countless training sessions. Despite facing one of La Liga's best goalkeepers, Courtois, Lee Taekhyun focused solely on what he had to do. ― Goooooal! It's a goal by Lee Taekhyun! Making the score 2-0! Ah~! Is Atlético Madrid collapsing in the Champions League final? ― With the world's best defense, Atlético Madrid can't do anything if they allow a counterattack while attacking like this! And Bayern Munich's counterattack was too perfect! ― This will make Atlético Madrid even more desperate, right? The players' mental state seems to be greatly shaken! At this moment, with Lee Taekhyun's goal scored, Shin Jaewook turned his gaze to look at his own body. \\"It's definitely improved.\\" When he tackled Gabi's ball and passed it to Schweinsteiger, it felt different than usual. He felt more centered, and the movements he had thought of in his head were well executed in reality. It felt as if his athletic ability itself had improved. Shin Jaewook knew the reason. [Perfect Physique] [Grade] A [Effect] Your body balance, strength, athletic ability, and physicality improve remarkably, and you become less likely to get injured. \\"The effect is clear.\\" It was thanks to the effect of the Perfect Physique (A) attribute, which he had gained when the Wonderful Physique (B) attribute grew after scoring the opening goal. \\"No wonder it feels good when an attribute grows.\\" Shin Jaewook grinned and then turned his gaze again. He saw the figure of Lee Taekhyun being congratulated by his teammates in the distance. \\"But that kid, his skills have improved even more.\\" --- Despite the 2-0 score, the Bayern Munich players did not let their guard down. Since it was still the first half, they knew the game could be turned around at any time. ― Bayern Munich is really managing the game well. Despite leading 2-0, the players are not being greedy and are moving stably. ― This must be frustrating for the Atlético Madrid players, right? This team enjoys counterattacks, but with Bayern Munich lowering their line, there are no opportunities for counterattacks. Plus, the sides are not being breached either. ― To overcome the current situation, Atlético Madrid needs to boldly attempt mid-range shots. They also need to pass forward through the center rather than the sides. Even if they fear Bayern Munich's counterattacks, they have to take risks to score, right? Coach Diego Simeone's shouts were incessant in the stadium. He yelled at the intimidated players to have confidence. As a coach with overwhelming charisma, the Atlético Madrid players immediately responded. They tried to overcome their subdued spirits and attempted more aggressive attacks. But the results were not good. It was because of Shin Jaewook. ― Wow! It's Shin Jaewook again! Shin Jaewook has cut off Atlético Madrid's attack with a fantastic sliding tackle! As he had done in the game against Real Madrid. As he had done against Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Luka Modrić, and Gareth Bale. Shin Jaewook performed a sliding tackle whenever Atlético Madrid tried to make an important forward pass. It was a tackle that perfectly interrupted the opponent's attack at the right timing. 'Definitely, my athletic ability and body balance have improved.' Shin Jaewook smoothly stood up after the sliding tackle. His movements were very quick. 'At this rate, I could carry the ball forward myself.' After checking his surroundings, Shin Jaewook smiled. The positions of the opposing players were not good. The defenders were fewer in number because they had been actively attacking. It was a situation where a player confident in their skills would be tempted to dribble. 'Let's give it a try.' Although he saw teammates in better positions moving, Shin Jaewook decided to take on the challenge himself this time. Thwock! He pushed the ball forward and accelerated. ― Shin Jaewook is moving forward! Bayern Munich's counterattack starts again with Shin Jaewook!"},{"instruction":"185 * * * 「한국, 2014 월드컵 첫 상대로 러시아 만난다!」 월드컵 H조에 들어간 한국의 첫 상대는 러시아로 결정됐다. 그 사실에 한국 축구팬들은 긍정적인 반응을 보였다. └ 러시아 정도면 할만할 것 같은데? 일단 1승은 가져간 느낌 아님? └ 다른 팀들보다는 해볼 만할 거 같긴 해. 러시아가 그렇게 강한 팀은 아니잖아ㅋㅋ └ 러시아 솔직히 축구 못해. 우리가 충분히 이길 수 있어. └ 우리는 수비가 문제임. 너무 못해. 근데 러시아 공격은 막을 수 있을지도? └ 러시아 정도면 신재욱이 실력 보여주기 좋지. 기석용, 구자천이 찔러주고, 손훈민, 이택현이 크로스 올려주면 신재욱 골 무조건 나올걸?ㅎㅎㅎ └ 빨리 보고 싶다! 한국이 어떤 경기를 보여주려나. 이번 대표팀엔 신재욱과 이택현, 그리고 손훈민, 기석용, 구자천과 같은 유럽파 선수들이 많다는 것. 이 정도 미드필더진과 공격진이라면 러시아를 충분히 공략할 수 있다는 생각에 한국 축구팬들은 경기에 대한 기대감을 높였다. 그리고 같은 시각. 한국대표팀 선수들은 열심히 훈련하며 브라질의 환경에 적응하는 시간을 보내고 있었다. “날씨 되게 좋은데? 축구 하기 좋은 날씨야!” 이제는 대표팀의 고참이 된 기석용이 만족스럽다는 얼굴로 소리쳤다. 그러자 다른 선수들도 고개를 끄덕였다. 이들 역시 브라질의 날씨에 만족하고 있었다. “맞아요. 브라질은 날씨가 좋은 것 같아요. 그리고 뭔가 땅도 부드러워서 맨발로 축구 해도 괜찮을 것 같아요.” “그래서 브라질에선 어린 친구들이 맨발로 축구 하기도 하잖아요.” “하! 여긴 날씨가 미쳤어요. 조금 덥긴 한데, 그래도 이 정도면 엄청 좋은 것 같아요.” 날씨가 좋아서일까? 대표팀 내의 분위기도 좋았다. 몇몇 고참 선수들이 기강을 잡긴 했지만, 심한 편은 아니었고 전체적으로 수평적인 관계를 유지했다. “형들! 라인 좀 올려주세요! 이럴 때 더 힘내주셔야 돼요! 실전에서도 딱 이럴 때 골 넣을 기회가 생긴다고요!” 이택현은 특히나 열정적이었다. 대표팀의 모든 선수가 그보다 나이가 많고, 선배였지만 전혀 신경 쓰지 않고 할 말을 했다. 애초에 별로 눈치를 보지 않는 성격이었고, 팀의 경기력이 더 나아질 수 있다면 얼마든지 떠들겠다는 마인드였기에 가능한 일이었다. “에이! 자천이 형! 좀 더 앞으로 나와서 받아주셔야죠!” 그런 이택현의 행동에도 대표팀의 선배들은 불편함을 드러내지 않았다. 이택현이 하는 말들이 팀의 경기력에 도움이 된다는 걸 알았기 때문이었다. ‘택현이가 잘하고 있네.’ 신재욱은 경기장의 분위기를 읽으며, 미소를 지었다. 자신이 직접 나서서 떠들지 않아도 이택현이 알아서 필요한 말들을 하고 있었다. 덕분에 편하게 훈련에만 집중할 수 있었다. ‘이 정도면 팀 분위기는 좋은 편이고, 경기력도 조금만 손보면 나쁘지 않아.’ 팀의 경기력도 마음에 들었다. 좋다고는 말할 수 없지만, 나쁘진 않았다. 최소한 러시아에게 지지는 않을 것 같다는 게 신재욱의 생각이었다. ‘물론 붙어봐야 알겠지만.’ * * * 일주일이 흘렀다. 한국대표팀 선수들은 브라질의 환경에 얼추 적응했다. 시차에도 잘 적응했고, 날씨나 잔디 상태에도 적응했다. 훈련도 순조롭게 끝이 났다. 그래서일까? 경기장에 모습을 드러낸 한국대표팀 선수들의 얼굴엔 자신감이 드러났다. ― 선수들이 경기장에 들어오고 있습니다! 우리 선수들의 표정이 좋은데요? 자신감이 보입니다! ― 여유가 느껴지네요. 러시아와의 경기를 대비하면서 준비가 잘된 걸까요? ― 우리 대표팀 선수들이 좋은 경기를 보여주길 바라면서, 양 팀의 스쿼드를 소개해드리겠습니다. 우선 한국의 스쿼드를 보시면 신재욱 선수가 원톱으로 나왔고, 그 뒤엔 이택현, 손훈민, 이청영, 김국영, 기석용, 홍정오, 김영원, 이훈, 윤성영, 정석룡 선수가 선발로 출전했습니다. ― 이택현 선수가 공격형 미드필더 역할을 맡았네요? 윙어로 뛰게 될 거라는 예상이 많았는데 말이죠. ― 이택현 선수는 최근에도 소속팀인 바이에른 뮌헨에서 공격형 미드필더로 출전했었으니까요. 경기력도 좋았기 때문에 문제는 없을 것 같습니다. 워낙 다재다능한 선수이지 않습니까? ― 그렇습니다. 양쪽 윙어에는 손훈민 선수와 이청영 선수가 나왔네요. 워낙 잘하는 선수들이죠? 한국의 스쿼드는 꽤나 강력했다. 수비진은 무게감이 떨어졌지만, 미드필더진과 공격진만큼은 대부분 유럽파 선수들로 이뤄져 있어서인지 무게감이 상당했다. 특히 스트라이커인 신재욱과 공격형 미드필더인 이택현, 양쪽 윙어 역할을 맡은 손훈민과 이청영은 아직 경기가 시작되지 않았음에도 강렬한 존재감을 드러내고 있었다. ― 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수의 합류로 한국대표팀의 전력이 확실히 강해진 것 같습니다! 그러나 방심할 순 없습니다. 러시아의 스쿼드 역시 만만치 않거든요! ― 러시아 선수들도 지금 보시면 자국에서 뛰고 있는 선수들도 있지만, 대부분 유럽파거든요? 경험도 많은 선수들이기 때문에 절대 만만히 볼 수 있는 팀이 아닙니다! 해설들이 양 팀의 스쿼드를 설명하는 것을 끝냈을 때. 경기가 시작할 조짐이 보였다. 관중들은 기대감이 담긴 환호를 내뱉었고. TV로 경기를 지켜보던 한국 축구팬들 역시 긴장감이 녹아있는 응원을 시작했다. └ 드디어 시작하나? 하…… 떨린다! └ 뭐야? 러시아도 죄다 유럽에서 뛰는 선수들이네? 왜 몰랐지? 이러면 좀 빡센 거 아닌가? └ 대한민국 이겨라!!!!!!!!! └ 러시아도 장난 아니네. 근데 그래도 난 한국이 이길 거라고 믿어! └ 재욱아! 가자! 갓재욱!!!!!! 재욱신!!!!!! └ 러시아 박살 내고 알제리랑 벨기에도 잡아버리자!!!!! └ 16강 가보자!!!!!!!! └ 손훈민이 뭔가 보여줄 것 같은데? 얘 양발 슈팅 오지잖아! └ 신재욱이랑 이택현도 양발 슈팅 미쳤음!!!! 오늘 한국 화력 레전드급이야ㅋㅋㅋ 삐이이익! 양 팀에게 아주 중요한 경기가 지금 시작됐다. ― 경기 시작됐습니다! 16강을 바라보는 팀들이 승부를 결정짓기 위해 맞붙었습니다! 한국과 러시아는 시작부터 강렬하게 부딪쳤다. ― 양 팀의 중원 싸움이 굉장히 치열한데요? 두 팀 모두 주도권을 내주지 않으려는 게 느껴집니다! ― 기세에서 밀리지 않겠다는 거죠! 두 팀 모두 서로에게 강하 압박을 넣고 있습니다! 패스를 주고받고, 서로에게 달려들며 압박하는 치열한 중원 싸움이 이어졌다. 하지만 점유율은 조금씩 한쪽으로 기울었다. ― 이택현 선수! 탈압박이 굉장히 좋은데요? 러시아 선수들에게 몸싸움에서 전혀 밀리지 않고, 좋은 발밑 기술을 보여주며 공을 지켜내고 있습니다! ― 와! 이택현 선수가 공을 잡으면 뺏기질 않네요! 바이에른 뮌헨의 경기를 볼 땐 이택현 선수가 이 정도로 탈압박이 좋은지는 몰랐었는데, 상대가 러시아여서 그런 걸까요? 이택현 선수의 뛰어난 탈압박 능력이 제대로 드러나고 있습니다! ― 바이에른 뮌헨에서는 간결한 플레이를 많이 보여줬기 때문에 잘 드러나지 않았던 것 같습니다. 하지만 공격형 미드필더로 뛰었다는 것 자체가 실력이 좋다는 것이거든요? 공격형 미드필더이면서 경기장을 넓게 뛰어다니며 공을 지켜주고, 정확한 패스를 뿌려주는 이택현의 활약 덕분이었다. 더구나 손훈민과 이청영, 기석용도 기본기가 좋은 선수들답게 별다른 실수 없이 패스를 주고받으며 점유율을 높이는 것에 일조했다. 그리고 신재욱은. ― 신재욱 선수가 소속팀에서 보여주던 플레이와는 다르게, 최전방에서 내려오지 않고 있네요? ― 동료들이 중원 싸움을 잘해주니, 굳이 내려올 필요가 없는 거죠. 최전방에서 골 기회를 노리는 것에 집중하고 있는 것 같습니다! 오로지 골 기회만을 노렸다. 밑으로 내려가서 경기를 풀어주면 그만큼 최전방에서 공을 잡는 횟수도 줄게 되고, 골 기회도 줄어드는 게 당연했다. 그래서 지금은 수비 가담을 전혀 하지 않고 있었다. ‘다행이야. 다들 잘 싸워주고 있어.’ 공을 거의 만지지 않고 있지만, 신재욱은 높은 수준의 집중력을 유지하고 있었다. 곧 기회가 온다는 걸 본능적으로 느끼고 있었으니까. ‘지금!’ 신재욱은 이택현과 눈빛을 교환했다. 그 순간 곧바로 몸을 돌려 속도를 높였다. 이택현의 패스를 예상한 움직임이었다. 그리고 이택현은 기대를 저버리지 않았다. 터엉! 공을 가볍게 찍어 차서 앞으로 보내는 패스. 난이도가 매우 어려운 패스였지만, 이택현의 얼굴엔 자신감이 흘렀다. 쉬이익! 날아온 공은 러시아 수비수의 키를 아슬아슬하게 넘기며 골키퍼에게 뺏기지 않는 위치에 떨어져 내렸다. 그리고 공이 떨어지기 직전. 러시아의 페널티박스 안으로 파고든 신재욱이 발등으로 공을 때려냈다. 정확한 임팩트로 때려낸 슈팅이었고, 공은 골키퍼가 반응하기 힘들 정도로 빠르게 쏘아졌다. 철썩! 러시아의 골망이 크게 흔들렸다. ― 우워어어어어! 고오오오오오오오올! 골! 신재욱 선수의 골입니다! 골이 터짐과 동시에 관중석에선 환호가 터져 나왔다. 한국을 응원하는 팬들의 환호였다. 러시아의 선수들은 어안이 벙벙한 표정으로 신재욱을 바라봤다. 한국 선수들 역시 너무 놀라서 순간적으로 움직임을 멈췄다. 그리고 신재욱은. “생각했던 것보다 수비가 허술한데?” 아무렇지 않은 표정으로 골대 안에 있는 공을 옆구리에 낀 채, 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었다. “잘하면 대량 득점도 가능하겠어.” * * * 툭! 신재욱은 공을 잔디 위에 내려놓았다. 그에겐 경기를 빠르게 재개하기 위한 행동에 불과했다. 그러나 팬들이 보기엔 그 어떤 세리머니보다도 멋있는 행동이었다. └ 신재욱 시그니처 세리머니 나왔다ㄷㄷㄷ 포스 미쳤어ㄷㄷㄷㄷ └ 내가 러시아 선수였다면 이미 쫄았을 듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 와……내가 월드컵에서도 저 세리머니를 보게 되다니ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 러시아 수비수들이 신재욱 이택현 조합을 아예 못 막네. 하긴 챔스권 팀들도 못 막은 조합인데, 쟤들이 어떻게 막겠어ㅋㅋㅋ └ 이택현 탈압박이랑 로빙패스가 너무 쩔었고, 신재욱의 침투랑 마무리도 미쳤어ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 얘넨 걍 미쳤음ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 특히 신재욱은;;;;; 로빙패스를 다이렉트로 때려버리네;;;;;; └ 다이렉트 발리슛 개쩔었어ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 지렸다…… 이게 신재욱이랑 이택현이지……. 경기장을 뜨겁게 달궈놓은 지금. 당사자인 신재욱은 동료들의 축하를 받았다. “미쳤다! 벌써 골을 넣어? 재욱아, 넌 월드컵에서도 실력을 그대로 보여주네?” “얜 긴장을 안 하잖아. 훈련 때랑 다른 게 없어. 너무 잘해!” “찢었다! 흐흐! 러시아 애들 지금 깜짝 놀랐어!” “골 축하한다!” 이어서 빨리 칭찬을 해달라는 이택현에게 엄지를 들어 올린 뒤에야 동료들의 축하는 끝이 났다. 잠시 후, 신재욱은 심판을 바라봤다. 이제 경기를 재개해달라는 무언의 압박이었다. ‘이 분위기를 살리려면 한 골 정도는 빠르게 더 넣어줄 필요가 있어.’ 아직 경기가 재개되지 않았지만, 신재욱은 이미 집중하고 있었다. 당장이라도 골을 넣을 준비가 되어있었다. 그런 상태에서. 삐이익! 경기 재개를 알리는 휘슬 소리가 들렸다. 그 순간 러시아의 공격진은 중앙에서 공을 건드렸다. 그런데 이때. 타닷! 신재욱이 속도를 높였다. ― 어어? 신재욱 선수가 알렉산드르 코코린 선수에게 달려듭니다!","output":"185 --- \\"Korea to face Russia as their first opponent in the 2014 World Cup!\\" Korea, placed in Group H, has Russia as their first opponent in the World Cup. Korean soccer fans showed a positive reaction to this news. └ Russia seems manageable, right? Feels like we've already secured one win? └ Compared to other teams, Russia seems beatable. They're not that strong a team, haha. └ Honestly, Russia isn't good at soccer. We can definitely win. └ Our defense is the problem. It's really bad. But maybe we can handle Russia's offense? └ Russia is a good match for Shin Jaewook to show his skills. With Ki Sung-yueng and Koo Ja-cheol feeding him, and Son Heung-min and Lee Taekhyun crossing, Shin Jaewook will definitely score goals, right? Haha. └ Can't wait to see it! I wonder what kind of game Korea will show us. This national team includes players like Shin Jaewook, Lee Taekhyun, Son Heung-min, Ki Sung-yueng, and Koo Ja-cheol, who play in Europe. With such a midfield and forward line, Korean soccer fans raised their expectations for the game, thinking they could definitely take on Russia. At the same time, the Korean national team players were training hard and adapting to the environment in Brazil. \\"The weather is really nice, isn't it? Perfect weather for soccer!\\" Ki Sung-yueng, now a veteran of the national team, shouted with a satisfied look on his face. The other players nodded in agreement. They too were pleased with the weather in Brazil. \\"Yeah, the weather in Brazil seems nice. And the ground feels so soft, it's like you could play soccer barefoot.\\" \\"That's why you see kids in Brazil playing soccer barefoot.\\" \\"Ha! The weather here is crazy. It's a bit hot, but still, it feels really good.\\" Was it because of the good weather? The atmosphere within the team was also positive. Although a few veteran players maintained discipline, it wasn't severe, and overall, they kept a horizontal relationship. \\"Guys! Push up the line! You need to work harder at times like this! This is when opportunities to score goals come in real matches!\\" Lee Taekhyun was particularly passionate. Although all the other players on the national team were older and his seniors, he didn't hesitate to speak his mind. He was naturally not the type to be overly concerned with others' opinions, and he was willing to speak up if it could improve the team's performance. \\"Hey! Ja-cheol hyung! You need to come forward more to receive the ball!\\" Despite Lee Taekhyun's behavior, the senior players on the national team did not show any discomfort. They knew that what Lee Taekhyun was saying was helping the team's performance. 'Taekhyun is doing well.' Shin Jaewook smiled as he read the atmosphere of the field. He didn't need to speak up himself because Lee Taekhyun was already saying what needed to be said. Thanks to that, he could focus comfortably on training. 'The team atmosphere is good, and with a little more work, the performance won't be bad.' He was pleased with the team's performance. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. At least, Shin Jaewook thought they wouldn't lose to Russia. 'Of course, we'll have to see when we play.' --- A week passed. The Korean national team players had mostly adapted to the environment in Brazil. They had adjusted to the time difference, the weather, and the condition of the grass. Training had also ended smoothly. Perhaps that's why? The faces of the Korean national team players who appeared on the field were filled with confidence. ― The players are entering the field! Our players look confident, don't they? You can see their confidence! ― They seem relaxed. Have they prepared well for the match against Russia? ― As we hope for our national team players to show a good game, let's introduce the squads of both teams. First, looking at Korea's squad, Shin Jaewook is the lone striker, followed by Lee Taekhyun, Son Heung-min, Lee Chung-yong, Kim Kook-young, Ki Sung-yueng, Hong Jeong-ho, Kim Young-won, Lee Hoon, Yoon Sung-young, and Jeong Seok-ryong as starters. ― Lee Taekhyun is playing as an attacking midfielder? There were many predictions that he would play as a winger. ― Lee Taekhyun has recently played as an attacking midfielder for his club, Bayern Munich. Since he performed well, there shouldn't be a problem. He's a very versatile player, isn't he? ― That's right. On both wings, we have Son Heung-min and Lee Chung-yong. They're both very skilled players, aren't they? Korea's squad was quite strong. Although the defense line was less impressive, the midfield and forward line were mostly composed of players who play in Europe, which gave them a significant presence. Especially striker Shin Jaewook, attacking midfielder Lee Taekhyun, and wingers Son Heung-min and Lee Chung-yong, even before the game started, were already showing a strong presence. ― With the addition of Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun, the Korean national team's strength has definitely improved! However, we cannot be complacent. Russia's squad is also not to be underestimated! ― The Russian players, as you can see, some play in their home country, but most are from Europe. They have a lot of experience, so it's not a team we can take lightly! As the commentators finished explaining the squads of both teams, signs that the game was about to start appeared. The crowd let out cheers filled with anticipation. Korean soccer fans watching the game on TV also began cheering with tension melting into excitement. └ Is it finally starting? Ah... I'm nervous! └ What? Russia also has players who play in Europe? Why didn't I know? Isn't this going to be tough? └ Go Korea!!!!!!!! └ Russia is no joke either. But still, I believe Korea will win! └ Go Jaewook! God Jaewook!!!!!! Jaewook God!!!!!! └ Let's smash Russia and then take down Algeria and Belgium too!!!!! └ Let's go to the round of 16!!!!!!!! └ I feel like Son Heung-min is going to show us something? His ambidextrous shooting is insane! └ Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun's ambidextrous shooting is crazy too!!!! Today Korea's firepower is legendary hahaha Peep! A very important game for both teams has now begun. ― The game has started! Teams aiming for the round of 16 are clashing to decide the outcome! Korea and Russia clashed fiercely from the start. ― The midfield battle between the two teams is extremely fierce, isn't it? You can feel that neither team wants to give up control! ― They don't want to be outdone in terms of momentum! Both teams are putting strong pressure on each other! The fierce midfield battle continued with passing and pressing each other. However, possession gradually tilted to one side. ― Lee Taekhyun! His pressure resistance is really good, isn't it? He's not being pushed around by the Russian players at all, showing good footwork and keeping the ball! ― Wow! Lee Taekhyun doesn't lose the ball when he gets it! Watching him play for Bayern Munich, I didn't realize his pressure resistance was this good. Is it because the opponent is Russia? Lee Taekhyun's excellent pressure resistance is really showing! ― At Bayern Munich, he showed a lot of concise play, so it might not have been as noticeable. But the fact that he played as an attacking midfielder itself shows that he's skilled, right? Thanks to Lee Taekhyun's efforts as an attacking midfielder, who ran widely across the field, kept the ball, and distributed accurate passes, the team's performance was boosted. Moreover, Son Heung-min, Lee Chung-yong, and Ki Sung-yueng, known for their solid fundamentals, contributed to increasing possession without making significant mistakes. And Shin Jaewook. ― Shin Jaewook is not coming down from the front line as he does in his club team, is he? ― Since his teammates are handling the midfield battle well, he doesn't need to come down. It seems he's focusing on looking for goal opportunities at the front! He was only looking for goal opportunities. Coming down to unfold the game would naturally reduce the number of times he got the ball at the front and the chances for goals. So, he was not participating in defense at all. 'It's a relief. Everyone is fighting well.' Although he barely touched the ball, Shin Jaewook maintained a high level of concentration. He instinctively felt that an opportunity was coming. 'Now!' Shin Jaewook exchanged glances with Lee Taekhyun. Immediately, he turned and accelerated. It was a movement anticipating Lee Taekhyun's pass. And Lee Taekhyun did not disappoint. Thump! A light chip pass sent the ball forward. It was a very difficult pass, but Lee Taekhyun's face was filled with confidence. Swoosh! The ball flew just over the heads of the Russian defenders and landed in a position where the goalkeeper couldn't snatch it. And just before the ball landed, Shin Jaewook, who had penetrated into Russia's penalty box, struck the ball with his instep. It was a shot with a precise impact, and the ball was fired so fast that the goalkeeper had difficulty reacting. Thwack! Russia's net shook violently. ― Wowwwww! Goooooal! Goal by Shin Jaewook! As the goal was scored, cheers erupted from the stands. They were cheers from the Korean fans. The Russian players looked at Shin Jaewook with stunned expressions. The Korean players were also so surprised that they momentarily stopped moving. And Shin Jaewook. \\"Is their defense weaker than I thought?\\" With an indifferent expression, he tucked the ball under his arm and ran towards the center of the field. \\"If we play well, we might score a lot.\\" --- Thump! Shin Jaewook placed the ball on the grass. For him, it was just an action to quickly restart the game. But for the fans, it was a move cooler than any celebration. └ Shin Jaewook's signature celebration is here... The presence is insane... └ If I were a Russian player, I'd be scared already, haha... Wow... I can't believe I'm seeing this celebration at the World Cup, haha. └ The Russian defenders can't stop the Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun combo. Well, even the Champions League teams couldn't stop them, how could they, haha. └ Lee Taekhyun's pressure resistance and lob pass were insane, and Shin Jaewook's penetration and finish were crazy, haha. They're just insane, especially Shin Jaewook;;;;; he just directly hit the lob pass;;;;;; └ That direct volley shot was insane, haha. └ I'm blown away... This is Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun... Now, with the stadium heated up, Shin Jaewook received congratulations from his teammates. \\"You're crazy! You scored already? Jaewook, you're showing your skills even in the World Cup?\\" \\"He doesn't get nervous. There's no difference from training. He's too good!\\" \\"You tore them apart! Haha! The Russians must be shocked right now!\\" \\"Congratulations on the goal!\\" After giving a thumbs up to Lee Taekhyun, who was eagerly waiting for praise, the teammates' congratulations ended. Shortly after, Shin Jaewook looked at the referee. It was a silent pressure to resume the game. 'We need to score one more goal quickly to keep up this momentum.' Although the game had not resumed yet, Shin Jaewook was already focused. He was ready to score a goal at any moment. In that state. Peep! The whistle sounded to resume the game. At that moment, Russia's forwards touched the ball in the center. But then. Tadat! Shin Jaewook accelerated. ― Huh? Shin Jaewook is rushing towards Alexander Kokorin!"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...) Monika: \\"...where is everyone?\\"","output":"Natsuki: \\"I don't know.

Sometimes characters just feel flat and one-dimensional, no matter how much the author tries.\\" Monika: \\"That's true, Natsuki. It's important for authors to give their characters depth and complexity for readers to connect with them.\\" Yuri: *leaning in, intrigued* \\"I agree. A well-developed character can provide insights into the human experience and make the story more immersive.\\" Sayori: \\"And it's not just in books either.

So, let's brainstorm some examples of memorable character development in literature and other media. Who wants to start?\\" Natsuki: \\"I'll go first. I think one great example is Frodo Baggins from 'The Lord of the Rings.' He starts off as an ordinary hobbit, but throughout the story, he undergoes tremendous growth and faces his deepest fears.\\" Yuri: \\"That's a wonderful example. Another one that comes to mind is Jay Gatsby from 'The Great Gatsby.' His character development and the complexities of his personality make the story all the more impactful.\\" Sayori: \\"Oh, I loved how Katniss Everdeen developed in 'The Hunger Games' series. She starts off as a strong survivor, but as the books progress, we see her grapple with the weight of her responsibility and the effects of the war.\\" Monika: \\"Those are all great examples. Character development truly adds depth and realism to any story. Let's take some time to research and share our findings next time we meet.\\" Natsuki: *grinning* \\"Alright, as long as we don't spend the whole time arguing about which anime characters have better development.\\" Monika: *laughs* \\"Fair enough, Natsuki.

Лаплас внёс значительный вклад в развитие теории вероятности и изучение математической физики, а его уравнение – Лапласа уравнение – играет важную роль в различных областях физики. Лаплас также предложил объяснение устойчивости Солнечной системы, разработав теорию, что он назвал \\"небесной механикой\\". Он автор книги \\"Трактат о небесной механике\\" (Traité de mécanique céleste), которая отразила его работы по суммированию и расширению достижений его предшественников, включая Исаака Ньютона. Добродетель, противоположная греху гордыни, согласно христианскому учению, – это скромность. Скромность подразумевает умение признавать свои ограничения, не считать себя лучше других и не стремиться к чрезмерному вниманию и почестям."},{"instruction":"Назови семь добродетелей","output":"В христианской этике различают семь основных добродетелей, которые состоят из трёх богоугодных (или теологических) добродетелей и четырёх кардинальных (или основополагающих) добродетелей. Три богоугодные добродетели: 1. Вера (лат. Fides) – доверие и вера в Бога и его откровения. 2. Надежда (лат. Spes) – уверенность в получении вечного блаженства и божьей помощи, а также упование на исполнение божественных обетований. 3. Любовь (лат. Caritas) – бескорыстная любовь к Богу и ближним, считается величайшей добродетелью и основой всех остальных добродетелей. Четыре кардинальные добродетели: 1. Рассудительность (или мудрость; лат. Prudentia) – способность правильно суждать и делать разумные решения в повседневной жизни. 2. Справедливость (лат. Iustitia) – стремление дать каждому то, что ему полагается, уважение прав и достоинства других людей. 3. Смелость (или мужество; лат. Fortitudo) – доблесть и стойкость в преодолении страхов, а также способность находить силы для выполнения правильных поступков вопреки трудностям. 4. Умеренность (лат. Temperantia) – самообладание и контроль над желаниями и страстями, стремление к умеренности во всех аспектах жизни. Вся семь добродетелей переплетается и поддерживает друг друга, создавая этический фундамент для моральной христианской жизни."},{"instruction":"Какая добродетелей, самая важная?","output":"В христианской традиции наиболее важной считается добродетель любви (лат. Caritas), также известная как агапэ. С точки зрения христианской теологии, любовь является величайшей из добродетелей, потому что она является основой и конечной целью всех христианских поучений и образом жизни. Апостол Павел в Первом послании к Коринфянам (13:13) пишет: \\"Теперь же пребывают вера, надежда, любовь, эти три; но из них больше всех – любовь\\". Этот стих подчёркивает первостепенное значение любви, ставя её выше веры и надежды. Любовь, согласно христианскому пониманию, заключается не только в привязанности и эмоциональных чувствах, но также в сознательном выборе бескорыстно действовать в интересах других, заботясь о их благополучии и служа им. Это основано на подражании Божьей любви к человечеству, которая выражается в бескорыстии и жертве Иисуса Христа по христианским учениям."},{"instruction":"Чем отличается любовь от страсти?","output":"Любовь и страсть часто сопутствуют друг другу, особенно в романтических отношениях, но это разные эмоциональные состояния с различными характеристиками и проявлениями. Страсть обычно связана с сильными, иногда бурными эмоциями, физическим влечением и интенсивным желанием. Она часто характеризуется высоким уровнем возбуждения, непосредственностью и может быстро возникать. Страсть иногда может быть кратковременной, взрывной и порой импульсивной. Она может направляться на разные объекты и изменяться в зависимости от обстоятельств или настроений. Любовь, с другой стороны, это более глубокое и длительное чувство, которое включает в себя заботу о другом человеке, эмоциональную привязанность, взаимопонимание и принятие. Любовь может включать страсть, но она также связана с доверием, уважением, преданностью и готовностью помочь и поддержать любимого человека. Более всего любовь ценится за то, что она умеет пережить изменения и оставаться постоянной в течение долгого времени, часто углубляясь и укрепляясь через общие преодоления, личностный рост и взаимные уступки. В христианском контексте любовь (агапэ) также означает бескорыстное, самоотверженное служение другим, стремление делать добро без ожидания награды или признания. Резюмируя, основным отличием между любовью и страстью является глубина чувства, его продолжительность и основание. Любовь рассматривается как более зрелое и устойчивое чувство, тогда как страсть часто ассоциируется с физическим влечением и интенсивными, но иногда менее устойчивыми эмоциями."},{"instruction":"В чём разница между умеренностью и рассудительностью?","output":"Умеренность и рассудительность являются двумя из четырех кардинальных добродетелей в христианской этике, и они отличаются по своей природе и области применения. Умеренность (лат. Temperantia): - Это добродетель, которая связана с самообладанием и управлением собственными страстями и желаниями. Умеренность заключается в поиске баланса и воздержании от излишеств в еде, питье, сексе и других удовольствиях или потребительских занятиях. - Человек, обладающий умеренностью, способен контролировать свои инстинктивные желания и подчинять их более высоким целям и общему благу. - Умеренность часто связывают с понятием воздержания и способностью сказать \\"нет\\" соблазну, чтобы поддерживать здоровые и устойчивые образ жизни и отношения. Рассудительность (лат. Prudentia): - Эта добродетель тесно связана с принятием решений и мудростью. Рассудительность означает способность рассуждать и выбирать наиболее подходящие средства для достижения нравственно правильных целей. Она требует глубокой проницательности и внимательности к деталям, а также умения обдумывать последствия своих поступков. - Рассудительности нужна осведомлённость и забота о долгосрочных последствиях в дополнение к способности поддерживать целостные моральные стандарты. Она включает принятие обоснованных и обдуманных решений. - Человек, проявляющий рассудительность, смотрит на ситуацию со всех сторон, обдумывает возможные риски и преимущества и находит оптимальные решения. В целом, умеренность больше фокусируется на контроле над чувственными желаниями и эмоциями, в то время как рассудительность больше связана с разумным и обоснованным подходом к принятию решений и действиям. Обе добродетели необходимы для развития сбалансированного и ответственного образа жизни."},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"Certainly, I'd be happy to help with translations.

EPL이나 라리가에 얘보다 잘하는 스트라이커가 있어? 난 못 찾겠는데? └ 루이스 수아레스가 있잖아. └ 리버풀의 루이스 수아레스? 얘도 이번 2013/14시즌만큼은 괴물이었지. 근데 난 루이스 수아레스가 신재욱보다 더 뛰어난 스트라이커라는 말엔 동의 못 하겠어. 물론 검증이 필요하겠지만, 난 신재욱이 EPL에 오면 루이스 수아레스보다 더 잘할 거라고 믿어. └ 이번 시즌의 루이스 수아레스와 비교되는 것만으로도 신재욱은 세계 최고의 스트라이커 중 하나야. └ 난 이택현한테 충격받았어. 얘, 레알 마드리드나 바이에른 뮌헨에서도 주전으로 뛸 수 있겠는데? 빠른데다가 기본기도 좋고, 축구 지능도 높더라. └ 필립 람과 슈바인슈타이거도 높은 클래스를 제대로 보여줬어. 그리고 프랑크 리베리는 역시나 프랑크 리베리다웠고. └ 이 경기를 보고 있는 축구팬들이라면 다 같은 생각일 거야. 리오넬 메시와 크리스티아누 호날두에 이어서 신계에 오를 선수는 신재욱이야. 전 세계 축구팬들의 반응은 비슷했다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 경기력에 놀랐고, 신재욱의 실력에 충격받았다는 반응이 대부분이었다. 그리고 많은 수의 축구팬들이 주장했다. 신재욱은 신계에 오를 선수라고. 크리스티아누 호날두와 리오넬 메시의 뒤를 이을 선수라고. ― 이제 시간이 얼마 남지 않았습니다! 양 팀 선수들이 조금만 더 힘을 내줬으면 좋겠습니다! 경기 종료가 가까워질수록 양 팀 선수들의 움직임이 느려졌다. 체력이 바닥나버린 것이다. 그런데 유일하게 멀쩡히 뛰는 선수가 있었다. 놀랍게도 그 선수는 체력적으로 지쳐야 할 시간에 오히려 더 컨디션이 좋아 보였다. [극도의 정신력] [등급] S [효과] 체력이 완전히 바닥났을 때, 극도의 정신력을 발휘하며 많은 시간 더 뛸 수 있게 됩니다. 특성의 효과가 발휘될 때, 컨디션이 매우 좋아집니다. 성장한 특성의 효과를 받은 신재욱. 그가 날뛰기 시작했다. 추가시간을 다 합쳐도 경기 종료까지 10분 정도밖에 안 남은 상황이었지만. “10분이면 충분하지.” 신재욱이 무언가를 만들어내기엔 차고 넘치는 시간이었다. ― 신재욱 선수가 굉장히 활발하게 움직이고 있습니다! 이건…… 놀라운데요? 지금까지 힘을 아껴뒀던 걸까요……? ― 말이 안 됩니다! 신재욱 선수는 전반전과 후반전 내내 많이 뛰었거든요? 전 세계가 지켜보는 챔피언스리그 결승전. 그 무대에 선 신재욱이 전 세계 축구팬들을 강렬한 충격에 빠뜨리기 시작했다.","output":"182 --- Before his reincarnation, during the days when he was Michael Shin. His dribbling ability was among the best in the world. He was a player with one of the highest successful dribble rates globally, often breaking through the opposition's defense, fulfilling the role of a crack player. 'I was so good with the ball at my feet that I played well as a winger too.' Moreover, his speed was incredibly fast. It was hard to find a player faster than him anywhere in the world. 'I was fast. Track and field experts said I could have been a medalist if I had pursued athletics.' However, now that he has reincarnated, he can no longer unleash that same speed. He can no longer play the game of mocking defenders with just his speed. However, he had regained much of his past dribbling ability. That alone was enough to break through Atletico Madrid's defense. Shin Jaewook was confident of that. \\"I can definitely do it.\\" During a counterattack created by cutting off Atletico Madrid's offense. The opponent was a team considered to have the best defense in the world at the time. But there was no hesitation in Shin Jaewook's advance. Thwack! Tap! He kicked the ball forward briskly, increasing his speed. It looked refreshing from the outside, but such dribbling also exposed vulnerabilities. Naturally, Atletico Madrid's defenders saw these openings. \\"Cut him off!\\" \\"His dribble is long! Intercept it!\\" \\"Block him right away!\\" The shouts of Atletico Madrid's players erupted. Joao Miranda, who was running closest to Shin Jaewook, charged at him. Joao Miranda was a player known for his intelligent defense using his good head. His ability was so great that he played as a starting defender for Atletico Madrid alongside his teammate Diego Godin. But now, he showed an uncharacteristic eagerness. He couldn't resist going for the obvious gap in Shin Jaewook's defense. — Joao Miranda is charging at player Shin Jaewook! Joao Miranda's movement to extend his leg was sharp. However, the problem was that Shin Jaewook had anticipated it. 'The tackle was too hasty. I won't fall for such a tackle.' Shin Jaewook pushed the ball to the opposite side just as Joao Miranda stretched out his leg. At the same time, he moved in the direction he had pushed the ball. — Wow! Shin Jaewook has bypassed Joao Miranda with a neat dribble! — Atletico Madrid is in crisis! Joao Miranda's tackle was too hasty! With a defender bypassed in a situation that allowed a counterattack, a significant gap opened in Atletico Madrid's defense. Shin Jaewook thoroughly exploited that gap. — The choice of direction for Shin Jaewook's dribble is excellent! This player is so intelligent! — It's as if he's looking down from above on the field, finding the opponent's weaknesses! How wide is Shin Jaewook's field of vision? His movement, penetrating only through the opponent's weaknesses with perfect judgment, was refreshing to watch and didn't cause any frustration for the viewers. Of course, for the defenders who had to block him, it was a dreadful movement. Swoosh! Tap! As Shin Jaewook penetrated the space created by Joao Miranda, Atletico Madrid's goalkeeper Courtois left his goal and rushed out. It was an action to try to steal the ball from the attacker or, at the very least, reduce the shooting angle. However, this action had a significant weakness. It was very vulnerable to chip shots. — Goooooal! It's a goal by Shin Jaewook! He's showing his abilities even in the Champions League final! — Such a calm finish! He saw Courtois coming out and executed a precise chip shot! That's a true striker! — Every decision was perfect! The dribbling and shooting were fantastic! After this match, Shin Jaewook's reputation will rise even higher, won't it? — He's already receiving love calls from many teams, right? Ha ha! If this continues, Shin Jaewook's agent will have a lot of work to do. — Bayern Munich must be feeling anxious, right? They want to keep Shin Jaewook, but he's playing too well! Shin Jaewook was a player who could freely execute chip shots, and he easily scored a goal by shooting over Courtois's height. 'I did it. Thanks to <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> rushing in hastily, it was easier than I thought.' It was a satisfying goal. It was close to the best movement he could make with his current physical condition. 'Let's not rush anymore.' Even though he scored, Shin Jaewook didn't run towards the ball as usual. He stretched out his arms towards his approaching teammates and shouted loudly. \\"Now it's 3 to 0!\\" --- 3 to 0 score. The first half ended like that. Bayern Munich focused on defense and successfully blocked Atletico Madrid's attacks. — The second half begins! Can Atletico Madrid turn around the situation they're in? In the second half, Atletico Madrid put more power into their offense. They were a team aiming for the Champions League title, so it was an inevitable choice. However, attacks that didn't work well when they were hasty didn't suddenly start working. Naturally, Atletico Madrid's attackers showed their frustration. — Diego Costa has lost the ball and is showing his frustration! This player is known for not having the best mentality, and he already has a yellow card, so he needs to be especially careful. — David Villa attempted a breakthrough but failed. That was a forced attempt, wasn't it? Bayern Munich's defense is showing high concentration today, so they won't fall for such attempts! — Arda Turan's dribble has been stopped! This player is known for his excellent dribbling, but even so, it's hard to break through when Philipp Lahm and Rafinha, two players, are sticking to him! Atletico Madrid's attacks were repeatedly blocked. Time passed, and Atletico Madrid's concentration waned. After 30 minutes into the second half, Bayern Munich created good opportunities instead. 'The atmosphere has shifted a lot. In such times, it's not bad to try to score one more rather than just killing time.' Shin Jaewook smiled faintly as he got the ball. Until now, he had been passing the ball stably to his teammates in the back, but now he didn't want to do that. He didn't want to ignore the vulnerabilities the opponent had exposed. Boom! Shin Jaewook sent a pass deep into the flank. It was a precise pass that floated the ball with just the right amount of power. Since it was a good pass that was easy to receive, Franck Ribery, who was moving to the flank, easily caught the ball. — Shin Jaewook connects with Franck Ribery! Franck Ribery was a world-class winger with a lot of experience and a player who showed good performance in most matches. He was one of the undisputed legends of Bayern Munich. Today, as on other days, Franck Ribery broke through Atletico Madrid's flank defense. — Franck Ribery! He's penetrating into Atletico Madrid's penalty box! Good movement! Franck Ribery's movement was bold. Confidence oozed from every action. — What? Is he going for it himself? Franck Ribery! He's a player with the ability to finish! Atletico Madrid's defenders couldn't focus only on Franck Ribery. Lee Taekhyun and Thomas Muller were moving threateningly inside the penalty box. And Shin Jaewook had also arrived near the penalty box. — Franck Ribery! He shoots! In the end, Atletico Madrid's defenders couldn't interfere with Franck Ribery's shot. The price for that was high. — It's in! Franck Ribery! Goal! He shoots directly and scores! — As expected of a player with class! Franck Ribery seals the deal for Atletico Madrid! 4 to 0. It was a one-sided score that shocked football fans around the world. Especially considering that this match was the Champions League final, it was even more shocking. └ Bayern Munich is completely dominating! I didn't expect this... └ Shin Jaewook 2 goals, Lee Taekhyun 1 goal, Franck Ribery 1 goal... Bayern Munich's firepower was the best in the world. The world's best shield, Atletico Madrid, has been shattered. └ It's shocking. I didn't expect Atletico Madrid to be beaten like this. └ I'm amazed by Shin Jaewook's skills. So he was this good? I knew he was good because he was the top scorer in the Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons, but isn't he the best active striker? Is there a striker in the EPL or La Liga better than him? I can't find one. └ There's Luis Suarez. └ Liverpool's Luis Suarez? He was a monster this 2013/14 season too. But I can't agree that Luis Suarez is a better striker than Shin Jaewook. Of course, it needs verification, but I believe Shin Jaewook would do better than Luis Suarez if he went to the EPL. └ Just being compared to this season's Luis Suarez makes Shin Jaewook one of the world's best strikers. └ I was shocked by Lee Taekhyun. This guy could be a starter for Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, right? He's fast, has good fundamentals, and high football intelligence. └ Philipp Lahm and Schweinsteiger also showed their high class properly. And Franck Ribery was, as always, Franck Ribery. └ If you're a football fan watching this game, you'll all have the same thought. After Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the next player to ascend to the pantheon will be Shin Jaewook. The reaction of football fans around the world was similar. They were amazed by Bayern Munich's performance and shocked by Shin Jaewook's skills. And many football fans claimed that Shin Jaewook was a player who would ascend to the pantheon. He would be the one to follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. — There's not much time left now! I hope the players from both teams can give a little more strength! As the end of the match approached, the movements of the players from both teams slowed down. They had run out of stamina. However, there was one player who was still running energetically. Surprisingly, this player seemed to be in better condition at a time when he should have been physically exhausted. [Extreme Mental Strength] [Grade] S [Effect] When stamina is completely depleted, extreme mental strength is exerted, allowing you to run for much longer. When the trait's effect is activated, your condition improves significantly. Shin Jaewook, who had received the effects of the grown trait, began to rampage. Even though there were only about 10 minutes left until the end of the match, including added time. \\"10 minutes is more than enough.\\" It was more than enough time for Shin Jaewook to create something. — Shin Jaewook is moving very actively! This is... surprising? Did he save his energy until now...? — It doesn't make sense! Shin Jaewook has been running a lot throughout the first and second halves? In the Champions League final, watched by the whole world, Shin Jaewook began to shock football fans with his intense performance."},{"instruction":"186 * * * 신재욱의 선제골로 1 대 0 스코어가 된 이후. 러시아 선수들의 머릿속엔 빨리 만회 골을 넣겠다는 마음이 가득했다. 이들은 오늘 한국에게 질 생각이 없었다. 무조건 이겨서 16강행을 노릴 생각이었다. 그래서 경기가 시작된 직후에도 빠르게 공을 돌리며 기회를 만들려고 했다. 그렇게 생각했었다. 갑자기 신재욱이 달려들기 전까지는. ― 어어? 신재욱 선수가 알렉산드르 코코린 선수에게 달려듭니다! 러시아의 공격수 코코린. 그는 발재간에 자신이 있는 선수였다. 때문에, 웬만하면 공을 뺏기지 않을 자신감이 있었다. 그래서일까? 덤벼드는 신재욱을 보고도 동료에게 공을 넘기지 않았다. 본능적으로 직접 탈압박을 시도했다. 그게 코코린의 실수였다. ― 뺏었습니다! 신재욱 선수가 전매특허인 슬라이딩 태클로 알렉산드르 코코린 선수의 공을 뺏어냈습니다! ― 여지없네요! 코코린 선수는 기술이 좋은 선수인데, 신재욱 선수의 태클에 걸리니 어쩔 도리가 없네요! ― 스트라이커이면서도 세계 최고 수준의 슬라이딩 태클 능력을 지닌 신재욱 선수입니다! ― 이러면 러시아로서는 기분이 나쁠 수밖에 없죠! 뭔가를 시도해보기도 전에 뺏겼거든요? 신재욱은 더 나아가지 않았다. 공을 뺏자마자 바로 근처에 있던 이청영에게 패스했다. 이청영은 유럽에서도 통할 정도로 기술이 좋은 선수였고, 지금도 그 능력을 보여줬다. ― 이청영 선수의 좋은 탈압박입니다! 오늘 움직임이 가벼워 보이는데요? ― 이청영이 기석용에게 공을 넘깁니다. 천천히 풀어나가려는 것 같네요. ― 급할 필요가 없죠. 선제골을 넣었으니까요. 이청영이 좋은 움직임으로 러시아의 압박을 이겨내며 기석용에게 공을 연결했고. 기석용은 근처에 있던 김국영에게 패스했다. 여유가 느껴지는 패스 플레이였다. 그러나 러시아의 압박은 점점 더 강해졌다. 자연스레 한국 선수들에게서도 여유가 사라졌다. 러시아의 압박을 쉽게 이겨낼 수 있는 선수는 한국대표팀에 많지 않았다. 물론 몇몇 선수는 달랐다. 여전히 여유가 넘쳤다. ― 손훈민 선수! 공을 잘 지켜냈습니다! 무리하진 않네요! 손훈민, 이택현에게 패스합니다. ― 이택현 선수, 오늘 컨디션이 굉장히 좋아 보였죠? 조금 전에 신재욱 선수의 골을 어시스트 하기도 했고요. 손훈민과 이택현. 이들은 러시아 선수들에게서 압박을 받으면서도 자신들의 플레이를 했다. 그리고 신재욱 역시 마찬가지였다. ― 이택현 선수의 좋은 드리블입니다! 압박을 벗어난 이택현이 속도를 높였다. 그는 앞으로 달리며 신재욱에게 공을 넘겼다. 그러나 달리는 것은 멈추지 않았다. 그리고 신재욱은 굴러오는 공을 툭― 밀어냈다. 앞으로 달려가는 이택현을 향한 원터치 패스였다. ― 오오오! 좋은 플레이입니다! 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수가 또다시 훌륭한 호흡을 보여줍니다! ― 이택현이 엄청난 속도로 파고듭니다! 신재욱의 패스는 절묘했다. 이택현이 달리는 속도에 정확히 맞춘 패스였고, 방향과 강도도 완벽했다. ― 이택현 선수가 공을 잡아냈습니다! 이택현은 공을 잡았다. 워낙 좋은 패스였기에 어렵지 않게 받아낸 것이었고, 곧바로 바디페인팅까지 사용했다. 들어오는 압박을 피하기 위한 움직임이었다. 휘익! 휙! 덤벼들던 러시아의 수비수는 이택현의 바디페인팅에 속아서 중심을 잃었다. 동시에 이택현에겐 공간이 생겼다. 슈팅하거나 드리블을 할 수 있는 공간. 이때, 이택현은 드리블을 선택했다. 이미 페널티박스에 걸친 위치였는데, 이제는 페널티박스 안으로 들어가며 골키퍼와의 거리를 좁혔다. 물론 그러자 다른 수비수가 덤벼들었다. 무시하기엔 위협적인 움직임이었다. 슈팅을 때릴 각도 사라졌다. 만약 슈팅을 때리고 싶으면 수비수를 제쳐야만 가능해지는 상황이었다. 그러나 이택현은 애초에 슈팅할 생각이 없었다. 더 깊게 들어간 이유도 수비수들의 시선을 끌기 위해서였다. 툭! 이택현은 뒤꿈치를 이용해 공을 뒤로 보냈다. 정확히는 왼쪽 대각선 뒤였다. “재욱쓰! 이 정도면 충분하지?” 좋은 자리를 잡고 있던 신재욱에게 흘려주는 패스. 신재욱으로서는 편안하게 슈팅을 때릴 기회가 만들어졌다. “어, 충분해.” 그렇게 중얼거리며, 신재욱은 공을 때려냈다. 왼발로 공을 강하게 감아 찼다. 골키퍼가 오른쪽으로 치우쳐 있는 걸 보고 골대 상단 왼쪽을 노린 슈팅이었다. 퍼어엉! 힘이 제대로 실렸고, 궤적도 깔끔했다. 골대의 오른쪽에 가깝게 위치하던 골키퍼가 막아낼 수 없는 슈팅이었다. ― 우오오옷! 들어갔습니다! 신재욱 선수의 두 번째 골이 터졌습니다! 이게 신재욱이죠! ― 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수의 호흡이 다시 한번 빛났습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 천재 듀오는 러시아의 수비수들이 감당하기엔 너무 강력하네요! 이택현의 어시스트를 받은 신재욱의 골. 스코어는 2 대 0이 되었고. 한국대표팀 선수들은 열광하며 신재욱과 이택현을 둘러쌌다. “이 예쁜 자식들! 둘이 아주 다 해 먹는구만!” “잘해도 너무 잘하는 거 아니야? 아주 괴물들이야!” “흐흐흐흐! 러시아 애들 멘탈 나갔다! 봐봐! 얼굴 보면 영혼이 날아갔잖아.” “택현아 너는 어떻게 거기서 백힐을 하냐? 재욱이랑 너는 서로 텔레파시라도 통하는 거야, 뭐야?” “대단한 놈들이야. 역시 천재들은 다르다니까?” 실시간으로 경기를 지켜보던 한국 축구팬들 역시 자리에서 벌떡 일어나며 기뻐했다. └ 골!!!!!!!!!!!! 터졌다!!!!!!!! └ 이게 한국 축구 맞아……? 왜케 잘하지?;;;;; 내가 알던 거랑은 너무 다른데……? └ 신재욱이랑 이택현이 한국 국대의 퀄리티를 3단계 정도는 높여놓은 느낌이야. 진짜 개잘한다ㄷㄷㄷㄷ └ 러시아 수비수들이 못하는 건가? 이택현이랑 신재욱을 아예 못 막네? └ 재욱이랑 택현이가 못해 보이게 만드는 거지. 얘네 클래스가 그만큼 높은 거야. └ 위에 말이 맞는 듯. 러시아가 못하는 게 아니고, 그냥 신재욱이랑 이택현이 잘하는 거 같아. └ 신재욱은 차는 족족 들어가네? 얘 결정력 사기 수준인데? └ 분데스리가 2시즌 연속 득점왕이잖아. 신재욱 결정력은 원래 좋았어. 러시아 국가대표팀의 분위기는 매우 안 좋았다. 선수들의 얼굴에 흐르던 자신감은 어느새 사라졌고, 서로의 잘못을 끄집어내며 고성을 주고받았다. 이런 러시아의 좋지 못한 분위기는 경기가 재개된 이후에도 나아지지 않았다. ― 러시아의 움직임이 좋지 않은데요? 지금은 글루샤코프 선수가 좀 더 전진해서 공을 받아줄 필요가 있어 보입니다! 그리고 사메도프 선수도 너무 공을 끌고 있어요! 이미 2번의 턴오버를 했거든요? 사메도프 선수는 조금 더 빠르게 볼 처리를 해야 할 것 같습니다! 러시아의 공격은 무뎌졌다. 경기 초반부터 힘을 실었던 중원 싸움에서도 한국에게 크게 밀리고 있었다. 자연스레 기회는 한국에게 찾아왔다. ― 손훈민 선수가 코너킥을 얻어냈습니다! 한국의 분위기가 매우 좋습니다! ― 기석용 선수가 코너킥을 준비하네요. 이 선수, 킥력이 매우 좋은 선수죠! 킥의 정확도가 뛰어난 기석용이 경기장 코너에서 코너킥을 찼다. 퍼어엉! 강하게 감아 찬 공이 러시아의 페널티박스 안으로 휘어져 들어갔다. 위협적인 궤적이었다. 이때, 페널티박스 안에 있던 선수들이 몸을 띄웠다. 그중 가장 좋은 위치에 있던 선수는 신재욱이었다. 신재욱은 기석용이 보낸 공의 궤적을 잘 예측했고, 좋은 타이밍에 몸을 띄우기까지 했다. 190cm의 수비수 바실리 베레주츠키가 바로 옆에서 방해를 해왔지만, 신재욱은 경합에서 전혀 밀리지 않았다. 점프력도 바실리 베레주츠키보다 더 뛰어났다. 터엉! 신재욱이 날아오는 공을 머리로 찍어 내렸다. 힘이 제대로 실린 헤더. 공은 대각선 밑으로 떨어져 내렸다. 러시아의 골키퍼가 당황하며 손을 휘저었다. 날아오는 공의 궤적을 예상하지 못했기에 나온 반응이었다. 운이 좋으면 공을 건드릴 수도 있었겠지만, 러시아의 골키퍼 아킨페프에겐 운이 따르지 않았다. 그의 손은 공을 건드리지 못했다. 투웅! 잔디 위로 떨어진 공이 다시 튕기며 러시아의 골대 안으로 들어갔다. ― 고오오오오오오올! 신재욱 선수가 엄청난 헤더로 세 번째 골을 기록했습니다! ― 해트트릭이네요! 신재욱 선수! 러시아를 무자비하게 무너뜨리고 있습니다! 수준이 다르네요! 정말 이 선수는 수준이 달라요! ― 신재욱 선수는 정말 대단한데요? 러시아의 수비수들을 너무 쉽게 상대하고 있어요! 더군다나 방금 상대한 바실리 베레주츠키 선수는 못하는 선수가 아니거든요? 러시아 리그의 강팀 CSKA 모스크바에서 매우 좋은 수비를 보여주는 선수인데, 신재욱 선수가 공중볼에서까지 압도해버리네요! ― 지난 2013/14시즌부터는 공중볼 경합 능력도 빠르게 좋아지면서, 결국 시즌 막바지엔 웬만한 수비수들은 전부 이겨버리지 않았습니까? 그리고 챔피언스리그에서도 좋은 공중볼 경합 능력을 보여줬었고요. ― 해외 축구팬들은 신재욱 선수를 완성형 스트라이커라고 말한다던데, 정말 완성형 스트라이커가 맞는 것 같네요. 발과 머리를 모두 잘 쓰며, 언제 어디서든 골을 넣어주니까요! 3 대 0. 이기고 있는 팀은 승리를 확신하게 되는 스코어였다. 반대로 지고 있는 팀은 패배를 직감하게 되는 스코어였다. 그리고 해트트릭을 기록하며 이런 상황을 만들어낸 신재욱은 흥분한 동료들에게 축하를 받고 있었다. “우오오오! 이 미친놈아! 해트트릭이라니! 으하하핫! 축하한다 진짜로!” “해트트릭을 해? 월드컵에서? 재욱아! 내가 살면서 너 같은 괴물을 또 볼 수 있을까?” “골 축하한다! 3골을 넣을 줄은 몰랐는데, 역시 대단해!” “재욱아, 고맙다. 네 덕에 어시스트 하나 올렸어.” “대단하다 정말! 거기서 경합을 이기고 헤더 골을 넣어버리네!” 같은 시각. 실시간으로 경기를 보던 한국 축구팬들 역시도 흥분하고 있었다. └ 와!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 해트트릭!!!!!! 또 신재욱이 넣었어!!!!! └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ러시아를 그냥 뚜드려 패버리네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 신재욱 얘는 너무 잘해서 할 말이 없다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 골!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 재욱신은 헤더도 잘해ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 이쯤 되니까 러시아가 불쌍해지는데?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 일단 러시아는 이긴 것 같네ㅎㅎㅎ 아직 전반전도 안 끝났는데 3 대 0이면 겜 끝났다고 봐야지. └ 경기 너무 재밌다ㅋㅋㅋ 호프집에서 스크린으로 축구 보고 있는데, 여기 사람들 다 흥분했음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 누가 신재욱 월드클래스 아니라고 했냐? 분데스리가 2시즌 연속 득점왕에 챔피언스리그 우승까지 했는데도 월드클래스 아니라고 우겼었지? 걔들 다 오늘 신재욱 실력보고 입 다물 수밖에 없을 거야. 진짜 개잘하니까ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 난 이제 승패는 안 궁금해ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그냥 이 경기에서 신재욱이 몇 골이나 넣을지 궁금해졌어ㅋㅋㅋ └ 러시아 ㅈ됐다;;;; 신재욱 컨디션 빨딱 섰다ㄷㄷㄷㄷ;;;; 이처럼 많은 사람을 열광하게 만든 지금. 당사자인 신재욱의 시선은 자꾸만 허공으로 향하고 있었다. 그럴 수밖에 없었다. 너무나도 자극적인 내용을 담은 메시지가 떠올랐으니까.

The Russian players were filled with the determination to quickly score an equalizer. They had no intention of losing to South Korea today. They were determined to win and aim for the round of 16. So, right after the game started, they quickly circulated the ball, trying to create opportunities. That was their plan until Shin Jaewook suddenly charged in. — Oh? Shin Jaewook is charging at Alexander Kokorin! Alexander Kokorin, the Russian striker, was confident in his footwork. Therefore, he had the confidence not to lose the ball easily. Was that why? Even seeing Shin Jaewook charging at him, he didn't pass the ball to a teammate. He instinctively tried to dribble past the pressure. That was Kokorin's mistake. — He's taken it! Shin Jaewook has stolen the ball from Alexander Kokorin with his signature sliding tackle! — It's undeniable! Kokorin is a skilled player, but there's nothing he can do against Shin Jaewook's tackle! — Shin Jaewook is a striker who also possesses one of the world's best sliding tackle abilities! — This must be frustrating for Russia! They lost the ball before they could even attempt anything. Shin Jaewook didn't advance further. As soon as he stole the ball, he passed it to Lee Chungyong nearby. Lee Chungyong was a player with enough skill to compete in Europe, and he showed his ability now. — Good dribbling by Lee Chungyong! He looks light on his feet today, doesn't he? — Lee Chungyong passes to Ki Sungyueng. They seem to be taking it slow. — There's no need to rush. They've scored the opening goal. Lee Chungyong overcame Russia's pressure with good movement and connected the ball to Ki Sungyueng. Ki Sungyueng then passed to Kim Kookyoung nearby. It was a relaxed passing play. However, Russia's pressure intensified. Naturally, the South Korean players also lost their composure. There weren't many players on the South Korean team who could easily overcome Russia's pressure. Of course, a few players were different. They still overflowed with composure. — Son Heungmin keeps the ball well! He's not rushing! Son Heungmin passes to Lee Taekhyun. — Lee Taekhyun looks in great condition today, doesn't he? He also assisted Shin Jaewook's goal earlier. Son Heungmin and Lee Taekhyun. Even under pressure from the Russian players, they played their game. And Shin Jaewook was no different. — Good dribbling by Lee Taekhyun! Lee Taekhyun accelerated after shaking off the pressure. He ran forward and passed the ball to Shin Jaewook. However, he didn't stop running. And Shin Jaewook lightly pushed the rolling ball. It was a one-touch pass towards the advancing Lee Taekhyun. — Oh! Great play! Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun show excellent teamwork again! — Lee Taekhyun breaks through with incredible speed! Shin Jaewook's pass was exquisite. It was a pass perfectly matched to Lee Taekhyun's running speed, and the direction and strength were flawless. — Lee Taekhyun has the ball! Lee Taekhyun caught the ball. It was an easy catch due to the quality of the pass, and he immediately used a body feint. It was a move to dodge the incoming pressure. Swoosh! Swish! The Russian defender who charged in was fooled by Lee Taekhyun's body feint and lost his balance. At the same time, space opened up for Lee Taekhyun. Space to shoot or dribble. At that moment, Lee Taekhyun chose to dribble. He was already near the penalty box, and now he entered it, closing the distance with the goalkeeper. Of course, another defender charged at him. It was a threatening move that couldn't be ignored. The angle for a shot disappeared. If he wanted to shoot, he would have to get past the defender. But Lee Taekhyun never intended to shoot in the first place. The reason he went deeper was to draw the defenders' attention. Tap! Lee Taekhyun used his heel to send the ball backward. Specifically, it was to the left diagonal behind him. \\"Jaewook! Is this enough?\\" A pass that flowed to Shin Jaewook, who was in a good position. For Shin Jaewook, it was a comfortable opportunity to take a shot. \\"Yeah, it's enough.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jaewook struck the ball. He curled it powerfully with his left foot, aiming for the top left of the goal as the goalkeeper was leaning to the right. Boom! The shot was powerful, and the trajectory was clean. It was a shot that the goalkeeper, positioned close to the right side of the goal, couldn't stop. — Wow! It's in! Shin Jaewook scores his second goal! This is Shin Jaewook! — Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun's teamwork shines once again! Bayern Munich's genius duo is too powerful for Russia's defenders to handle! Shin Jaewook's goal, assisted by Lee Taekhyun. The score became 2-0. The South Korean team players were ecstatic, surrounding Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun. \\"You beautiful kids! You two are doing everything!\\" \\"You're playing too well, aren't you? You're monsters!\\" \\"Hahaha! The Russians are mentally broken! Look at their faces; their souls have flown away.\\" \\"Taekhyun, how did you do a backheel there? Do you and Jaewook have telepathy or what?\\" \\"Amazing guys. Geniuses are different, aren't they?\\" Korean football fans watching the game live also jumped up in joy. └ Goal!!!!!!!!!!!! It's in!!!!!!!! └ Is this really Korean football...? Why are they playing so well?;;;;; It's so different from what I knew...? └ Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun feel like they've raised the quality of the Korean national team by three levels. They're really goodㄷㄷㄷㄷ └ Are the Russian defenders bad? Can't they stop Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun at all? └ It's just that Jaewook and Taekhyun make them look bad. Their class is that high. └ I agree with the above. It's not that Russia is bad, it just seems like Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are playing well. └ Shin Jaewook's shots are all going in? Isn't his finishing ability on a cheat level? └ He's been the top scorer in the Bundesliga for two seasons in a row. Shin Jaewook's finishing has always been good. The atmosphere in the Russian national team was very bad. The confidence that had been on the players' faces had disappeared, and they were loudly blaming each other for the mistakes. This poor atmosphere in Russia did not improve even after the game resumed. — Russia's movement isn't good, is it? Right now, Glushakov needs to move forward more to receive the ball! And Samedov is holding onto the ball too long! He's already turned it over twice, hasn't he? Samedov needs to handle the ball faster! Russia's attack had dulled. They were being significantly outplayed by South Korea in the midfield battle that had been intense from the start of the game. Naturally, opportunities came to South Korea. — Son Heungmin has won a corner kick! South Korea's mood is very good! — Ki Sungyueng is preparing for the corner kick. This player has a very good kicking ability! Ki Sungyueng, known for his accurate kicks, took the corner kick from the corner of the field. Boom! The ball, curled powerfully, bent into Russia's penalty box. It was a threatening trajectory. At that moment, the players in the penalty box jumped up. The player in the best position was Shin Jaewook. Shin Jaewook had predicted the trajectory of the ball sent by Ki Sungyueng well and jumped at the right timing. Vasily Berezutski, a 190cm tall defender, tried to interfere from the side, but Shin Jaewook was not outmatched in the contest. His jumping ability was even better than Vasily Berezutski's. Thump! Shin Jaewook headed the incoming ball downwards. It was a powerful header. The ball dropped diagonally downwards. The Russian goalkeeper flailed his hands in panic. It was a reaction because he hadn't anticipated the trajectory of the flying ball. With some luck, he might have touched the ball, but luck was not on the side of the Russian goalkeeper Akinfeev. His hand didn't touch the ball. Thud! The ball that hit the grass bounced up again and went into Russia's goal. — Goooooal! Shin Jaewook scores the third goal with an incredible header! — It's a hat-trick! Shin Jaewook! He's mercilessly demolishing Russia! He's on a different level! This player is really different! — Shin Jaewook is really amazing, isn't he? He's handling Russia's defenders too easily! And the defender he just faced, Vasily Berezutski, is not a bad player, you know? He shows very good defense at CSKA Moscow, a strong team in the Russian league, but Shin Jaewook has even dominated him in the air! — Since the 2013/14 season, his aerial duel ability has rapidly improved, and by the end of the season, he was beating almost all defenders, wasn't he? And he also showed good aerial duel ability in the Champions League. — Foreign football fans call Shin Jaewook a complete striker, and it seems right. He uses both his feet and head well, and he can score goals anytime, anywhere! 3-0. It was a score that made the winning team confident of victory. Conversely, it was a score that made the losing team sense defeat. And Shin Jaewook, who had scored a hat-trick and created this situation, was receiving congratulations from his excited teammates. \\"Woah! You crazy guy! A hat-trick! Hahaha! Congratulations, really!\\" \\"A hat-trick? In the World Cup? Jaewook, will I ever see a monster like you again in my life?\\" \\"Congratulations on the goal! I didn't expect you to score three, but you're really amazing!\\" \\"Jaewook, thanks. I got an assist because of you.\\" \\"Really amazing! To win the contest there and score a header goal!\\" At the same time. Korean football fans watching the game live were also excited. └ Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hat-trick!!!!!! Shin Jaewook scored again!!!!! └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋRussia is just getting beaten upㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Shin Jaewook is too good, I'm speechlessㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Goal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shin Jaewook is also good at headersㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ At this point, I feel sorry for Russia?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Looks like Russia is done forㅎㅎㅎ It's not even the end of the first half, and it's 3-0. The game is over. └ The game is so funㅋㅋㅋ I'm watching football on a screen at a beer hall, and everyone here is excitedㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Who said Shin Jaewook isn't world-class? He's been the top scorer in the Bundesliga for two seasons in a row and even won the Champions League, but some still argued he wasn't world-class? They'll all have to shut up after seeing Shin Jaewook's skills today. He's really goodㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Now I'm not curious about the win or lossㅋㅋㅋㅋ I'm just curious about how many goals Shin Jaewook will score in this gameㅋㅋㅋ └ Russia is screwed;;;; Shin Jaewook is in top conditionㄷㄷㄷㄷ;;;; In such a moment that excited many people. The person in question, Shin Jaewook, kept looking up into the air. He couldn't help it. A message with such provocative content had popped up.

Ирония, как мы знаем, это когда реальное значение чего-либо противоположно буквальному или очевидному смыслу. Она часто используется для высмеивания или критики, но с сохранением некоторого дистанцирования от ситуации. Ирония стала одним из определяющих элементов постмодернизма, который характеризуется скептицизмом, относительностью и отходом от \\"больших рассказов\\" или универсальной истины. Пост-ирония размывает границы между иронией и серьезностью, часто смешивая их в рамках одной формы выражения. Это направление может включать серьезное отношение к чему-то, что кажется совершенно абсурдным или нелепым, или, наоборот, ироничное отношение к тому, что обычно воспринимается серьезно. Это значит, что пост-иронический модус может являться одновременно притворным и искренним. Одна из основных функций пост-иронии – исследовать и подвергать сомнению смыслы и границы искренности и серьезности в нашем непрекращающемся потоке медиа и культурных сообщений. В пост-иронии участники культурных дискурсов могут играть с контекстом, предполагаемым смыслом и ожиданиями аудитории, чтобы создать мультидименсиональное общение, которое требует от потребителей более глубокого вникания в контент, чтобы понять, где проходит грань между серьезностью и шуткой. В искусстве, литературе и популярной культуре пост-ирония может проявляться в форме мемов, которые изначально представляют собой шутку, но также могут содержать серьезное послание, в юмористических шоу, которые серьезно обсуждают актуальные проблемы под видом шутки, или в литературных произведениях, где персонажи относятся с полной серьезностью к абсурдным ситуациям.

[극도의 정신력] [등급] S [효과] 체력이 완전히 바닥났을 때, 극도의 정신력을 발휘하며 많은 시간 더 뛸 수 있게 됩니다. 특성의 효과가 발휘될 때, 컨디션이 매우 좋아집니다. ‘컨디션이 확실히 좋아졌어. 신기하네.’ 신재욱은 상대의 측면 수비수를 어렵지 않게 뚫어냈다. 체력이 떨어졌더라면 쉽지 않았을 테지만, 지금은 컨디션이 좋아도 너무 좋았다. ― 신재욱 선수가 돌파합니다! 움직임이 굉장히 좋은데요? ― 워낙 기술이 좋은 선수죠! 일대일 돌파에서도 매번 강력한 모습을 보여주고요! 측면 수비수를 뚫어내자 이번엔 중앙수비수 디에고 고딘이 앞을 가로막았다. 신재욱의 시야엔 몇 가지 선택지가 보였다. 그중 돌파를 선택했다. 휘익! 휙! 오른쪽 측면에서 중앙으로 깊숙이 들어온 신재욱은 몸을 살짝살짝 움직이며 가벼운 페인팅을 넣었다. 그러나 디에고 고딘은 반응하지 않았다. 분명히 위험한 상황이었음에도 라리가 최고 수준의 수비수답게 침착함을 유지했다. ‘디에고 고딘, 훌륭한 수비수지. 근데 이번에도 참을 수 있을까?’ 신재욱은 오른쪽으로 헛다리를 한 번 짚은 뒤, 갑자기 속도를 높이며 왼쪽으로 공을 툭 치며 움직였다. 동시에 디에고 고딘이 움직였다. 이번엔 진짜라고 확신하며 다리를 뻗었다. 그러나 이번에도 신재욱의 움직임은 가짜였다. 왼쪽으로 공을 치자마자 발끝으로 다시 공을 오른쪽으로 끌어왔다. 굉장히 빠르게 나온 플립플랩. 우와아아아아아! 경기장엔 환호가 터져 나왔고. “젠장!” 돌파를 허용한 디에고 고딘의 입에선 욕설이 튀어나왔다. 오른쪽 측면에서 또다시 오른쪽 대각선으로 들어간 신재욱에겐 보였다. 매우 좁은 슈팅각이. ‘각이 거의 없네.’ 골대의 옆과 가까운 위치였기에, 슈팅할 각도가 거의 없었다. 대부분의 선수는 이런 위치에선 동료에게 컷백 패스를 뿌리는 걸 선택한다. 그러나 신재욱은 다른 선택을 했다. ‘충분히 넣을 수 있어.’ 골키퍼의 얼굴을 보고 슈팅하는 것. 정확히는 골키퍼의 바로 위, 공간을 노리고 때려낸 슈팅이었다. 워낙 가까운 거리에서 강하게 때린 슈팅이기에 골키퍼로서는 막는 게 매우 힘든 슈팅이었다. 더군다나 골키퍼로선 슈팅이 아닌, 컷백 패스까지도 경계하고 있는 상태였기에 더욱 반응하기가 힘들다. 퍼어어엉! 강렬한 타격음이 터졌고. 공은 순식간에 아틀레티코 마드리드의 골대 안으로 파고들었다. ― 우오오오오오! 골! 들어갔습니다! 신재욱! 해트트릭입니다! ― 해트트릭을 기록하는 신재욱 선수! 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스가 챔피언스리그 결승전에서 아틀레티코 마드리드를 완전히 무너뜨렸습니다! 이제 양 팀의 스코어는 5 대 0이 됩니다! 경기를 보던 팬들이 깜짝 놀라서 자리에서 일어났다. 관중석에 있던 팬들도 눈을 부릅뜨며 신재욱을 쳐다봤다. “챔피언스리그 결승전에서 해트트릭을 기록해? 그것도 세계 최고의 수비력을 지녔다는 아틀레티코 마드리드한테?” “엄청나네…… 이제 신재욱이 다른 리그에서는 안 통한다는 멍청이들은 보이지 않겠군.” “신재욱이 지난 시즌 라리가 최강의 팀을 부숴버렸어!” “이런 건 예상하지 못했어……!” “신재욱은 로봇인가? 지치지도 않고 뛰더니 결국 또 골을 만들어냈잖아?” 경기장에 있던 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들은 열광했다. 챔피언스리그 결승행이 사실상 확정되었다는 사실에 크게 기뻐했다. 반면 아틀레티코 마드리드의 분위기는 싸늘하게 식었다. 선수들은 고개를 푹 숙이며 완전히 희망을 잃은 듯한 모습을 보였다. 경기가 재개된 이후에도 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들은 별다른 공격을 시도하지 않았다. 이들도 끝까지 해야 한다는 걸 알고는 있지만, 힘이 나질 않았다. 그렇게 시간은 흘렀고, 어느 순간 주심은 호루라기를 입에 물었다. 삐이이이익! ― 챔피언스리그 결승전이 종료됩니다! 바이에른 뮌헨이 이번 챔피언스리그의 우승팀이 되었습니다! 챔피언스리그 우승. 그 영광을 가져간 팀은 바이에른 뮌헨이었다. 아틀레티코 마드리드의 팬들은 깊은 한숨을 내쉬며 결과를 받아들였다. 5 대 0이라는 압도적인 점수로 만들어낸 결과였기 때문이었다. 그리고 기뻐하던 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들은 신재욱을 찬양하기 시작했다. └ 신재욱이 미친 활약을 펼친 덕에 이길 수 있었어! 얜 정말 우리의 보물이야! └ 한국의 천재가 바이에른 뮌헨을 세계 최고의 팀으로 만들었어! └ 신재욱의 플레이를 보면 전설적인 스트라이커들의 장점만 가져온 것 같아. 그만큼 완벽하다고! └ 신재욱은 바이에른 뮌헨의 전설이 될 선수야. └ 무슨 소리야? 신재욱은 이미 전설이야. └ 신재욱은 움직임 하나하나가 예술이야. └ 난 신재욱이 제발 바이에른 뮌헨에 남아줬으면 좋겠어. 하지만 뮌헨을 떠난다고 해도 원망하지 않을 거야. 같은 시각. 한국의 축구팬들 역시 신재욱의 활약에 놀라움과 기쁨을 드러냈다. └ 와…… 만 18세의 한국인이 세계적인 무대인 챔피언스리그에서 우승 타이틀을 따내는 걸 보게 될 줄이야……. └ 신재욱 미쳤나 봐;;;;; 챔피언스리그 결승전에서 해트트릭;;;;;; └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ잘해도 너무 잘하니까 비현실적임ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 어떻게 한국에 이런 인물이 나왔지? └ 다시는 안 나올 인물이지. └ 이택현도 엄청 잘해서 뿌듯한데, 신재욱은 그냥 플레이 하나하나가 보는 것만으로도 소름이 돋아. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ우리 재욱이 챔스 우승!!!!! └ 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들 다 잘하긴 했지만, 신재욱 경기력이 특히나 좋더라. 그리고 마지막에 쌩쌩하게 뛰어다니는 건 소름이었음ㅋㅋㅋ └ 바이에른 뮌헨이 세계 최고의 방패라던 아틀레티코 마드리드를 5 대 0으로 발랐네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 경기 너무 재밌었다ㅋㅋㅋ └ 신재욱은 최소한 두 수는 위에 있는 선수처럼 보이더라. 어떻게 이렇게 어린 선수가 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스로 활약할 수가 있지? 솔직히 프랑크 리베리나 토마스 뮐러보다 훨씬 더 잘했어. 그리고. 한국 축구팬들은 기대감을 드러내기 시작했다. 신재욱이 있는 한국 축구대표팀이 곧 펼쳐질 2014 월드컵에서 어떤 모습을 보여줄지를. * * * 「바이에른 뮌헨, 라리가 우승팀인 아틀레티코 마드리드를 5 대 0으로 꺾고 챔피언스리그 우승!」 「챔피언스리그에서 해트트릭 기록하며 팀의 우승 이끈 신재욱, 각종 이적설에 휩싸여!」 「신재욱의 레알 마드리드 이적설 급부상!」 「FC 바르셀로나가 신재욱을 노린다! 거액의 이적료 준비 완료! 신재욱과 리오넬 메시 조합 볼 수 있나?」 신재욱의 이름값은 더욱 높아졌다. 한국에서도 마찬가지였다. 각종 포털사이트에서 신재욱과 관련된 기사들을 손쉽게 볼 수 있었다. 검색어 순위도 늘 최상위권에 올라 있었다. 그리고 한국 축구팬들은 신재욱의 활약에 열광하면서 또 다른 기대감을 드러냈다. └ 월드컵이 얼마 안 남았다ㄷㄷㄷㄷ 원래라면 기대 안 했겠지만, 이번 월드컵만큼은 기대된다ㄷㄷㄷㄷ └ 신재욱이 월드컵에선 어떤 모습을 보여줄까? 한국대표팀 멱살 잡고 어디까지 올려줄까?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 그래도 신재욱 정도면 최소한 16강까지는 끌어주지 않을까? └ 16강은 어려울 것 같은데……. └ 난 더 올라갈 수도 있다고 봄. 신재욱만 있는 게 아니고, 이택현이랑 손훈민, 기석용도 있잖아. 아, 구자천도 있네. └ 근데 한국은 수비가 약해서 높게는 못 올라갈 거야. 신재욱이 잘해주면 뭐 해. 수비가 다 말아먹을 텐데. └ ㅋㅋㅋ한국 수비가 심각하긴 하지. 근데 그래도 신재욱이라면 모른다. 우리 수비수들이 똥싸는 거 다 치워줄 수도 있어ㅋㅋㅋ └ 한국은 월드컵 8강까지만 올라가도 대박이야. 그나마 신재욱이 있어서 기대가 되네. 곧 펼쳐질 2014 브라질 월드컵. 그곳에서 한국대표팀이 어떤 활약을 펼칠 것인가에 대한 기대감이었다. 챔피언스리그 우승팀인 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스 신재욱. 그가 한국대표팀에서 뛸 거라는 사실은 한국 축구팬들을 설레게 하기에 충분했다. 반면, 팬들의 입에 끊임없이 오르내리는 당사자 신재욱은 쉬느라 바쁜 날을 보내고 있었다. “힘드네.” 온몸이 쑤셨다. 극도의 정신력(S) 특성 효과로 마지막까지 활동량을 높였던 게 문제였다. 신재욱은 경기가 끝난 직후부터 극심한 피로감을 느꼈다. “이건 최소 이주는 푹 쉬어줘야겠는데?” 평소 인터넷을 하는 편인 신재욱이기에, 한국팬들이 월드컵에 기대감을 드러내고 있다는 사실은 알고 있었다. “월드컵……무조건 성적 내야지.” 신재욱도 욕심이 났다. 이전에 청소년 월드컵에서 우승하며 많은 성장을 이뤄냈던 기억이 있었으니까. 더군다나 이번 2014 월드컵은 각 나라 최고의 선수들이 맞붙는 더욱 큰 대회니까. “이번 2014 월드컵에서 얼마나 성장할 수 있을지는 모르지만, 그래도 다른 경기들보단 훨씬 성장이 빠를 거야.” 그래서 신재욱은 더욱 필사적으로 쉬기로 마음먹었다. 물론 쉬는 내내 그의 손엔 월드컵에 참여하는 팀들에 대한 자료가 들려 있었다.","output":"183 --- Champions League Final. A match that football fans simply cannot miss. Now, less than 10 minutes remain in that match. It was a time when all players were exhausted. Indeed, the movements of the players had slowed down. Naturally, their concentration dropped, and there were problems with ball control. But then. - Philipp Lahm's pass! Oh! It was a pass to Shin Jaewook! - Shin Jaewook is sprinting down the flank! - Shin Jaewook! At a time when all players are tired, he alone is moving quickly! - He's not usually considered a fast player, but since the other players have all slowed down, he looks incredibly fast right now! Surprisingly, Shin Jaewook was still in good shape. While the other players were exhausted, Shin Jaewook was running around as if it was the beginning of the game. Naturally, football fans around the world were astonished. --- \\"Are you kidding me! Does this make any sense? Is Shin Jaewook on something? Why is he running around so energetically?\\" \\"Was Shin Jaewook's stamina always this good...? It's not the level I knew.\\" \\"How can he do that? Shin Jaewook is a starting player, isn't he? Why isn't he tired?\\" \\"His stamina is monstrous, isn't it?\\" \\"Do Koreans have some secret to improving their stamina? I know a Korean who eats something called 'hongsam' every day, maybe Shin Jaewook too?\\" \\"Where can I get this 'hongsam'?\\" \\"Idiots, you don't get stamina just by eating hongsam. This is just Shin Jaewook being amazing. He wasn't known for his stamina in his debut season, but how much effort has he put in since then?\\" \\"One thing's for sure, Atletico Madrid is going to have an even harder time from now on.\\" \\"Harder time from now on? That's terrible news for the fans of Atletico Madrid.\\" --- Everyone was looking at Shin Jaewook with disbelief. At that moment, Shin Jaewook, after receiving the ball on the flank, even attempted a bold breakthrough. Normally, at this time in the game, he would have played it safe. There was no need to create anything since the situation was already favorable. However, today he wanted to test something. The effect of the newly acquired 'Extreme Mental Strength (S)' as his trait had grown. --- [Extreme Mental Strength] [Grade] S [Effect] When stamina is completely depleted, extreme mental strength is exerted, allowing you to run for much longer. When the trait's effect is activated, your condition improves significantly. --- \\"My condition has definitely improved. It's amazing.\\" Shin Jaewook easily broke through the opposing flank defender. It would have been difficult if his stamina had been low, but now his condition was too good. --- - Shin Jaewook breaks through! His movement is very good, isn't it? - He's a player with great skill! He always shows a powerful performance in one-on-one breakthroughs! --- After getting past the flank defender, central defender Diego Godin stood in his way. Shin Jaewook saw several options in his field of vision. He chose to break through. Whisk! Whisk! Shin Jaewook, who had come deep from the right flank to the center, lightly moved his body and feinted. However, Diego Godin did not react. Despite the clearly dangerous situation, Godin, one of La Liga's top defenders, maintained his composure. --- \\"Diego Godin is an excellent defender. But can he hold back this time?\\" --- Shin Jaewook tapped his right foot as if to fake a move, then suddenly increased his speed and nudged the ball to the left. At the same time, Diego Godin moved. He stretched out his leg, convinced it was the real move this time. But again, Shin Jaewook's movement was a feint. After nudging the ball to the left, he quickly pulled it back to the right with the tip of his foot. A very fast flip-flap. Wowwwww! Cheers erupted from the stadium. \\"Damn!\\" Diego Godin, who had allowed the breakthrough, cursed. Shin Jaewook, who had entered diagonally from the right flank again, saw it. A very narrow shooting angle. --- \\"There's almost no angle.\\" --- It was so close to the side of the goal that there was hardly any angle to shoot. Most players would choose to cut back a pass to a teammate in such a position. But Shin Jaewook made a different choice. --- \\"I can definitely score.\\" --- Looking at the goalkeeper's face and shooting. Specifically, aiming for the space just above the goalkeeper and striking the shot. It was a very difficult shot for the goalkeeper to block because it was struck so powerfully from a close distance. Moreover, the goalkeeper had to be wary of not just the shot but also a cutback pass, making it even harder to react. Boom! A loud impact sound erupted. The ball quickly burrowed into Atletico Madrid's goal. --- - Wow! Goal! It's in! Shin Jaewook! A hat-trick! - Shin Jaewook scores a hat-trick! Bayern Munich's ace has completely shattered Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final! The score between the two teams is now 5 to 0! --- Fans watching the game were shocked and stood up from their seats. Fans in the stands also widened their eyes and looked at Shin Jaewook. \\"Scoring a hat-trick in the Champions League final? Against Atletico Madrid, known for having the world's best defense?\\" \\"Incredible... Now those idiots who said Shin Jaewook wouldn't make it in other leagues won't show their faces.\\" \\"Shin Jaewook has just destroyed the strongest team in La Liga last season!\\" \\"I didn't expect this...!\\" \\"Is Shin Jaewook a robot? He kept running without getting tired and ended up scoring again?\\" --- Bayern Munich's fans at the stadium were ecstatic. The fact that their team's trip to the Champions League final was virtually confirmed made them very happy. On the other hand, the atmosphere among Atletico Madrid fans had turned cold. The players hung their heads low, looking as if they had completely lost hope. Even after the game resumed, Atletico Madrid players did not attempt any significant attacks. They knew they had to keep going until the end, but they just didn't have the energy. As time passed, at some point, the referee put the whistle to his lips. --- Whistle! - The Champions League final is over! Bayern Munich is the champion of this year's Champions League! --- Champions League victory. The team that claimed the glory was Bayern Munich. Atletico Madrid's fans sighed deeply and accepted the result. It was a result created by an overwhelming score of 5 to 0. And Bayern Munich's fans, who had been celebrating, began to praise Shin Jaewook. --- \\"Thanks to Shin Jaewook's insane performance, we could win! He's truly our treasure!\\" \\"The Korean genius has made Bayern Munich the best team in the world!\\" \\"Watching Shin Jaewook play, it's like he has only the strengths of legendary strikers. He's that perfect!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook will be a legend for Bayern Munich.\\" \\"What are you talking about? Shin Jaewook is already a legend.\\" \\"Every move Shin Jaewook makes is art.\\" \\"I hope Shin Jaewook stays with Bayern Munich forever. But even if he leaves, I won't hold it against him.\\" --- At the same time. Korean football fans were also amazed and delighted by Shin Jaewook's performance. --- \\"Wow... I never thought I'd see a 18-year-old Korean win a Champions League title on the world stage...\\" \\"Shin Jaewook is insane;;;;; scoring a hat-trick in the Champions League final;;;;;;\\" \\"ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He's unrealistically goodㅋㅋㅋㅋ How did such a person come out of Korea?\\" \\"We won't see another like him.\\" \\"I was proud of Lee Taekhyun's great performance, but Shin Jaewook's every play gives me goosebumps.\\" \\"ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Our Jaewook won the Champions League!!!!!\\" \\"Although all Bayern Munich players played well, Shin Jaewook's performance was particularly good. And seeing him run around energetically at the end was chillingㅋㅋㅋ\\" \\"Bayern Munich has trampled Atletico Madrid, known as the world's best shield, with a score of 5 to 0ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ The game was so much funㅋㅋㅋ\\" \\"Shin Jaewook seemed to be at least two levels above the other players. How can such a young player be the ace of Bayern Munich? Honestly, he played much better than Franck Ribery or Thomas Muller.\\" --- And then. Korean football fans began to express their anticipation. They were excited to see how the Korean national team, with Shin Jaewook, would perform in the upcoming 2014 World Cup. --- \\"Bayern Munich, the Champions League winner, crushes La Liga champions Atletico Madrid 5 to 0!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook, who led the team to victory with a hat-trick in the Champions League, is surrounded by various transfer rumors!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook's transfer to Real Madrid is rapidly emerging!\\" \\"FC Barcelona is targeting Shin Jaewook! They are ready with a huge transfer fee! Will we see a combination of Shin Jaewook and Lionel Messi?\\" --- Shin Jaewook's value had risen even higher. It was the same in Korea. Articles related to Shin Jaewook could easily be found on various portal sites. His name was always at the top of the search rankings. And Korean football fans, while ecstatic about Shin Jaewook's performance, expressed another expectation. --- \\"The World Cup is not far awayㄷㄷㄷㄷ I wouldn't have expected much normally, but this time I'm looking forward to itㄷㄷㄷㄷ\\" \\"What will Shin Jaewook show in the World Cup? How far will he carry the Korean national team?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ\\" \\"Maybe Shin Jaewook alone can at least get us to the round of 16?\\" \\"The round of 16 seems difficult...\\" \\"I think we can go even higher. It's not just Shin Jaewook, there's also Lee Taekhyun, Son Heungmin, Ki Sungyueng. Oh, and Koo Jacheol.\\" \\"But Korea's defense is weak, so they won't go very high. What's the use if Shin Jaewook does well? The defense will ruin everything.\\" \\"ㅋㅋㅋ Korean defense is seriously problematic. But still, with Shin Jaewook, you never know. He might clean up all the mess our defenders makeㅋㅋㅋ\\" \\"Korea reaching the quarterfinals of the World Cup would be amazing. At least we have Shin Jaewook, so there's hope.\\" --- The upcoming 2014 Brazil World Cup. There was anticipation for how the Korean national team would perform there. Shin Jaewook, the ace of the Champions League-winning Bayern Munich. The fact that he would play for the Korean national team was enough to excite Korean football fans. Meanwhile, Shin Jaewook, the subject of endless discussion among fans, was busy resting. --- \\"It's tough.\\" His whole body ached. The problem was the activity level he maintained until the end due to the effect of the Extreme Mental Strength (S) trait. Shin Jaewook had been feeling extreme fatigue since the end of the game. --- \\"I need at least two weeks of complete rest.\\" Shin Jaewook, who usually browsed the internet, knew that Korean fans were expressing their expectations for the World Cup. --- \\"The World Cup... I must achieve good results.\\" Shin Jaewook was also ambitious. He remembered growing a lot by winning the Youth World Cup before. Moreover, the 2014 World Cup was an even bigger tournament where the best players from each country would compete. --- \\"I don't know how much I'll grow in this 2014 World Cup, but it will definitely be much faster than other games.\\" So Shin Jaewook decided to rest even more desperately. Of course, even while resting, he had materials about the teams participating in the World Cup in his hands."},{"instruction":"187 * * * 월드컵을 앞뒀을 때. 신재욱은 기쁜 마음으로 대표팀에 합류했다. 성장에 큰 도움이 될 거라는 기대감이 있었으니까. 물론 잘해야 성장할 수 있겠지만, 그 부분은 자신이 있었다. 그리고 오늘. 신재욱은 러시아를 상대로 전반전이 끝나기도 전에 3개의 골을 넣었다. ‘월드컵인데 기대를 안 할 수가 없지.’ 해트트릭을 기록한 뒤. 신재욱은 동료들의 축하를 받으며 허공을 힐끔힐끔 보고 있었다. 메시지가 뜰 거라는 기대감에 나온 행동이었다. ‘안 나오나?’ 웃으며 고맙다고는 말했지만, 동료들의 말들이 귀에 들어오지 않았다. 지금만큼은 메시지의 생성 여부가 가장 중요했으니까. 이때, 기다렸던 메시지가 떠올랐다. 신재욱의 얼굴에 떠오른 미소도 더욱 짙어졌다.

[최고급 헤더 컨트롤] [등급] A [효과] 헤더의 정확도가 대단히 높아집니다. 또한, 헤더의 파워와 방향을 조절하는 것이 더 편해집니다. ‘두 개의 특성 모두 효과가 추가됐어. 극도의 슈팅 컨트롤의 경우엔 불안정한 자세로도 정확도 높은 슈팅……아크로바틱한 슈팅도 퀄리티가 높아진다는 건가? 이건 직접 뛰면서 확인해봐야겠어. 최고급 헤더 컨트롤은 헤더의 파워, 방향 조절이 추가됐군. 이것도 효과가 어느 정도인지 기회가 오면 바로 확인해봐야겠어.’ 신재욱은 심판을 바라봤다. 호루라기를 입으로 가져가고 있었다. 경기를 재개시키려는 행동이었다. ‘벌써 전반전이 끝나가네.’ 시간이 짧게 느껴졌다. 그만큼 경기가 잘 풀렸고, 재밌었다. 그래서인지 전반전이 조금 더 길었으면 좋겠다는 생각이 들었다. ‘딱 5분만 더 주면 후반전 넘어가기 전에 한 골 더 만들 수도 있을 것 같은데.’ 삐이익! 호루라기 소리와 함께 러시아 선수들이 패스를 주고받았다. 신재욱을 포함한 한국 선수들은 상대를 강하게 압박하지 않고, 여유를 가지며 지역방어를 하기 시작했다. 굳이 추가 골을 노릴 필요가 없으니 체력을 아끼며 남은 시간을 보내려는 의도였다. ― 우리 선수들이 영리하게 경기를 운영하네요. 러시아에 비하면 굉장히 여유가 느껴지죠? ― 그렇습니다. 러시아는 3 대 0으로 밀리고 있어서 급할 수밖에 없는데, 이럴 땐 안정적으로 지역방어를 하는 게 낫죠. 시간이 흘렀다. 신재욱은 러시아의 공격을 수비하면서도 계속해서 역습을 준비했지만, 아쉽게도 기회는 오지 않았다. ― 전반전이 종료됩니다! 대한민국이 놀라울 정도로 좋은 경기력을 보여주며 러시아를 완전히 압도했습니다! 우리 선수들이 전반전에 워낙 잘해줘서 후반전엔 어떤 모습을 보여줄지 더욱 기대되네요! 후반전이 시작됐다. 한국의 전술은 크게 달라진 게 없었다. 잘 풀렸던 전반전의 전술을 그대로 들고 나왔다. 반면 러시아는 전술을 바꿨다. 전반전보다 훨씬 공격적인 전술을 들고나왔다. 교체 카드도 사용했다. ― 러시아가 이른 시간에 선수를 교체하네요. 공격수를 투입합니다! 이젠 대놓고 골을 노리겠다는 것 같죠? ― 어쩔 수 없는 선택이죠. 빨리 골을 넣어야 하니까요. 공격이 최고의 방어라고 했던가? 심할 정도로 공격에 힘을 실은 러시아의 전술에 한국 선수들은 밀리는 모습을 보여줬다. 러시아는 큰 체구를 앞세우며 거친 몸싸움을 걸어왔고, 최전방에 있는 공격수를 향한 롱패스도 과감하게 뿌려댔다. 공격의 정교함은 떨어졌지만, 불안한 한국의 수비를 위협하기엔 충분했다. ― 이그나셰비치 선수가 이번에도 롱패스를 뿌립니다! ― 어우! 방금은 굉장히 위험했습니다! 김영원 선수가 코코린 선수를 완전히 놓쳤죠! 정석룡 선수의 선방이 아니었으면 그대로 골이 됐을 장면입니다! 뻥축구라고도 불리는 러시아의 롱패스 전술은 계속해서 한국의 수비를 괴롭혔다. 결국, 후반 17분엔 가장 좋은 기회를 만들어냈다. ― 글루샤코프 선수의 좋은 롱패스입니다! 코코린 선수가 침투합니다! 빠릅니다! 홍정오 선수가 뒤쫓아 보지만 따라잡지 못합니다! 한국! 위험합니다! 러시아의 미드필더 데니스 글루샤코프가 과감한 롱패스를 뿌렸고, 러시아의 스트라이커 알렉산드르 코코린이 빠른 속도로 침투하며 공을 받아냈다. 순식간에 만들어진 골키퍼와의 일대일 상황. 알렉산드르 코코린은 여유 있는 슈팅으로 정석룡 골키퍼를 뚫어내고 골을 집어넣었다. ― 러시아의 첫 번째 골이 나왔습니다……! 코코린 선수의 스피드를 노린 러시아의 공격이 이번엔 제대로 먹혀들었네요. ― 우리 수비수들이 뒷공간을 잘 지켜내야 할 것 같습니다. 후반전에 들어서는 계속해서 뚫리고 있거든요? 조금 더 집중해줬으면 좋겠습니다! 한국의 불안한 수비는 팀의 사기를 떨어뜨렸다. 유리한 상황이었음에도 선수들의 입에선 한숨이 흘러나왔다. 경기를 지켜보던 한국 축구팬들 역시 분통을 터트렸다. └ ㅅㅂ 너무 답답한데? 수비 이거 맞냐? 걍 허수아비들 아님? └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ홍정오랑 김영원 수준 왜 이래?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국에서 제일 잘하는 수비수들 맞아?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 어이가 없네ㅋㅋㅋ 러시아가 똑같은 패턴으로 공격하고 있는데, 그걸 못 막고 골을 먹히네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 아니 뻥축구에 왜 이렇게 휘둘리냐고!!!!!!!! 잘하던 애들까지 멘탈 흔들리겠다ㅡ,ㅡ └ 수비수 좀;;; 하……발도 겁나 느리고, 그렇다고 오프사이드 트랩 관리가 되는 것도 아니고, 라인컨트롤 쓰레긴데 도대체 왜 쓰는 거야? 홍정태 감독이 얘네들한테 약점이라도 잡혔나? └ 짜증 나지만, 이게 한국 수비의 현실임. 쟤네가 한국 최고의 수비수들은 맞잖아. 그리고 다들 한국 수비 못 하는 거 알고 있었잖아. 기대라도 했던 것처럼 왜 그래? 동시에 한국 축구팬들은 불안해하기 시작했다. 러시아의 공격에 이렇게나 흔들리면 역전을 당할 수도 있겠다는 생각을 하게 됐다. 그러나 이들의 불안감은 오래 지속되지 않았다. 신재욱 덕분이었다. * * * 신재욱은 원톱 스트라이커로 출전했지만, 중앙에만 머무르지 않았다. 양쪽 측면으로도 자주 움직이며 러시아 수비수들의 머릿속을 복잡하게 만들었다. 이런 움직임으로 인해서 윙어로 출전한 손훈민과 이청영이 느끼는 부담감도 줄어들었다. 지금도 그랬다. 중앙 쪽으로 달리다가 어느새 측면으로 빠진 신재욱이 공을 받아냈다. 정확하게 뿌려주는 기석용의 패스였다. 툭! 가슴으로 공을 받아낸 신재욱은 공이 바닥에 닿기 전에 발등으로 툭 차올렸다. 공은 포물선을 그리며 빠르게 덤벼들던 러시아 측면수비수의 키를 넘겼다. 그사이 신재욱은 이미 수비수를 지나치며 바닥으로 떨어져 내리는 공을 다시 받아냈다. ― 이야! 수비수를 가볍게 제쳐내는 신재욱 선수입니다! 역시 기술이 굉장히 좋네요! ― 허허! 시원시원한 돌파였습니다! 수비수 하나를 제쳐내면서 측면으로 파고든 신재욱은 빠르게 패스를 뿌려냈다. 골을 만들어내기에 좋은 컷백 패스였다. 엄청난 스피드로 침투하던 이택현이 공을 향해 다리를 휘둘렀다. ‘들어가나?’ 신재욱의 눈이 빛났다. 이택현의 슈팅은 제대로 맞았다. 그대로 뻗어 나가기만 하면 골로 연결될 가능성이 컸다. 그러나 아쉽게도 공은 상대 수비수의 몸에 맞았다. ― 아! 이게 수비수의 몸에 맞네요! 이택현 선수, 굉장히 아쉬워하고 있습니다! 이 선수, 오늘 2개의 어시스트를 기록할 정도로 컨디션이 매우 좋거든요? 분명히 골을 넣고 싶은 욕심도 있을 겁니다! ― 러시아에게 운이 따랐네요. 방금 슈팅은 골이 될 줄 알았는데 말이죠. ― 그래도 코너킥이 선언되며 한국이 공격을 이어가게 됐습니다! 아쉬운 상황이었지만, 신재욱의 표정엔 변화가 없었다. 다음으로 생길 기회를 노리기 위해 집중할 뿐이었다. ― 선수들이 페널티박스 안에서 치열하게 자리다툼을 하고 있습니다. 아! 주심이 선수들에게 경고를 주네요. 몸싸움이 너무 거칠다는 경고입니다. ― 기석용 선수가 코너킥을 준비합니다! 전반전에도 좋은 궤적으로 코너킥을 차며 신재욱 선수의 헤더 골을 도왔던 기석용 선수인데요, 이번엔 어떤 킥을 보여줄까요? 경기장은 시끄러웠다. 양 팀을 응원하는 팬들의 함성 때문에, 선수들끼리의 소통이 힘들 정도였다. 이토록 시끄러운 상황에서도 기석용은 집중력을 잃지 않았다. 실력이 좋은 선수답게 연습했던 그대로 코너킥을 찼다. 퍼어엉! 빠르고 강력하게 휘어져 들어가는 공. 높이는 적당했다. 184cm의 신재욱이 점프했을 때, 머리에 맞추기 좋은 높이였다. 게다가 현재의 신재욱은 신체 능력이 매우 좋아진 상태였다. 점프력 역시 웬만한 선수들보다 뛰어났다. 지금도 그랬다. 신재욱은 190cm라는 큰 키를 지닌 러시아의 수비수 바실리 베레주츠키와의 공중볼 경합에서 또다시 승리해냈다. ― 신재욱! 헤더! 거친 공중볼 경합이 이뤄지는 상황 속에서 신재욱은 날아오는 공을 정확히 이마에 맞춰냈다. 그리고 그때, 특별한 느낌을 받았다. [최고급 헤더 컨트롤] [등급] A [효과] 헤더의 정확도가 대단히 높아집니다. 또한, 헤더의 파워와 방향을 조절하는 것이 더 편해집니다. 최고급 헤더 컨트롤 특성의 효과란에 적혔던 설명처럼, 헤더의 파워와 방향을 잘 조절할 수 있겠다는 느낌이 본능적으로 들었다. 게다가 특별한 느낌은 이걸로 끝이 아니었다. [극도의 슈팅 컨트롤] [등급] S [효과] 슈팅의 정확도가 대단히 높아집니다. 또한, 슈팅의 파워 조절이 더 편해집니다. 불안정한 자세로도 정확도 높은 슈팅을 할 수 있습니다. 극도의 슈팅 컨트롤 특성의 효과란에 적혀있던 ‘불안정한 자세로도 정확도 높은 슈팅을 할 수 있다.’라는 문구. 그 문구가 주는 효과를 공을 이마에 맞추는 것과 동시에 정확히 느꼈다. ‘헤더도 같은 슈팅으로 포함되는 건가?’ 짧은 생각이 스쳤고. 신재욱은 본능적으로 느껴지는 느낌들을 믿으며, 이마로 날아오는 공의 방향을 바꿨다. 원하는 방향은 오른쪽. 원하는 위치는 골키퍼가 막을 수 없는 구석이었다. 터엉! 이마에 맞은 공이 러시아의 골대 안으로 향했다. 놀랍게도 공은 신재욱이 원했던 궤적, 방향, 파워, 위치와 거의 오차가 없이 날아갔다. ― 우와아아아아아! 들어갔습니다! 골입니다! 골! 신재욱 선수가 다시 한번 머리로 골을 넣었습니다! 엄청난 헤더네요! ― 분위기를 한 번에 바꿔놓는 골입니다! 신재욱 선수가 불타오르려던 러시아에게 찬물을 끼얹었습니다! ― 이건 찬물이 아니라 얼음물 수준이죠! 신재욱 선수! 러시아를 압도적인 실력으로 찍어누르고 있습니다! 신재욱의 네 번째 골. 그 골 장면을 본 모두가 경악했다. 그리고 TV로 경기를 지켜보던 한 남자는 재밌다는 듯 웃음을 터트렸다. “으하하하! 굉장한데? 역시 분데스리가와 챔피언스리그에서 날아다니던 선수다워!”","output":"187 --- When the World Cup was approaching. Shin Jaewook joined the national team with joy. He had expectations that it would greatly help his growth. Of course, he needed to perform well to grow, but he was confident in that aspect. And today. Shin Jaewook scored three goals before the first half even ended against Russia. 'I can't help but have high expectations for the World Cup.' After recording a hat-trick. Shin Jaewook was receiving congratulations from his teammates while glancing at the sky, expecting a message to appear. It was an action born out of anticipation for a message. --- 'Isn't it coming?' --- He smiled and thanked them, but he couldn't hear his teammates' words. Right now, the most important thing was whether the message would appear or not. At that moment, the awaited message popped up. Shin Jaewook's smile deepened. --- [Trait growth!] ['Advanced Shooting Control (A)' has grown into 'Extreme Shooting Control (S)'.] [Trait growth!] ['Intermediate Header Control (B)' has grown into 'Advanced Header Control (A)'.] --- 'Great!' --- He had anticipated the growth of his traits. His stats had recently grown, so it would take time for them to increase further. However, he didn't expect two traits to grow. --- 'I'm feeling too good.' --- Still beaming, Shin Jaewook looked at the information of his grown traits. --- [Extreme Shooting Control] [Grade] S [Effect] The accuracy of your shots greatly increases. Additionally, controlling the power of your shots becomes easier. You can make accurate shots even in unstable positions. [Advanced Header Control] [Grade] A [Effect] The accuracy of your headers greatly increases. Additionally, controlling the power and direction of your headers becomes easier. --- 'Both traits have added effects. With Extreme Shooting Control, I can make accurate shots even in unstable positions... does that mean even acrobatic shots will have higher quality? I'll have to check this out while playing. Advanced Header Control has added power and direction control. I'll have to check how effective this is as soon as I get the chance.' --- Shin Jaewook looked at the referee. He was bringing the whistle to his mouth. It was an action to resume the game. --- 'The first half is already ending.' --- Time felt short. The game was going well and was fun. That's why he wished the first half was a little longer. --- 'Just give me 5 more minutes, and I might be able to score another goal before the second half.' --- Whistle! With the sound of the whistle, the Russian players exchanged passes. Shin Jaewook and the Korean players did not press the opponents strongly but started to play a relaxed zonal defense. There was no need to chase an additional goal, so they intended to conserve energy for the remaining time. --- ― Our players are managing the game wisely. Compared to Russia, they seem very relaxed, don't they? ― That's right. Russia is trailing 3-0, so they have to be in a hurry, but in this situation, it's better to play a stable zonal defense. --- Time passed. Shin Jaewook was preparing for counterattacks while defending against Russia's offense, but unfortunately, no opportunities came. --- ― The first half is over! South Korea has completely dominated Russia with an astonishing performance! Our players did so well in the first half that we're looking forward to what they'll show us in the second half! --- The second half began. South Korea's tactics hadn't changed much. They brought the same tactics that worked well in the first half. On the other hand, Russia changed their tactics. They came out with a much more aggressive approach than in the first half. They also used their substitution cards. --- ― Russia is making an early substitution. They're bringing on a striker! It seems they're openly aiming for a goal now, right? ― They have no choice. They need to score quickly. --- Is offense the best defense? Korean players were pushed back by Russia's tactics, which put a lot of emphasis on attack. Russia used their large physique to engage in rough physical battles and boldly threw long passes towards their forward at the front. The precision of the attack decreased, but it was enough to threaten Korea's shaky defense. --- ― Ignashevich sends another long pass! ― Ooh! That was very dangerous! Kim Youngwon completely lost Kokorin! If it weren't for Jung Seokryong's save, it would have been a goal! --- Russia's long pass tactic, also known as \\"kick and rush,\\" continued to trouble Korea's defense. Eventually, in the 17th minute of the second half, they created their best opportunity. --- ― A good long pass from Glushakov! Kokorin is penetrating! He's fast! Hong Jeongo is chasing after him, but he can't catch up! Korea is in danger! --- Russian midfielder Denis Glushakov sent a bold long pass, and Russian striker Alexander Kokorin received the ball with great speed. A one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper was created in an instant. Alexander Kokorin scored a goal with a composed shot, beating goalkeeper Jung Seokryong. --- ― Russia's first goal...! Russia's attack, relying on Kokorin's speed, has finally paid off. ― Our defenders need to guard the back space better. They've been getting breached continuously since the second half started. I hope they concentrate a bit more! --- Korea's shaky defense lowered the team's morale. Despite being in a favorable situation, sighs could be heard from the players. Korean football fans watching the game also exploded in frustration. --- └ Damn, this is so frustrating. Is this really defense? Are they just scarecrows? └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Why are Hong Jeongo and Kim Youngwon like this?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Are they really the best defenders in Korea?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ It's ridiculousㅋㅋㅋ Russia is attacking with the same pattern, and we can't stop it and concede a goalㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Why are we getting swayed by kick and rush soccer!!!!!!!! Even the good players are getting their mentality shakenㅡ,ㅡ └ The defenders;;; Ugh... they're so slow, and they can't even manage the offside trap properly, the line control is trash, why are they even playing? Did coach Hong Jeongtae get blackmailed by these guys or something? └ It's annoying, but this is the reality of Korean defense. These guys are the best defenders in Korea, right? And everyone knew Korean defense was weak. Why are you acting like you had expectations? --- At the same time, Korean football fans began to feel anxious. They thought that if they were shaken this much by Russia's attack, they could be overtaken. However, their anxiety did not last long. Thanks to Shin Jaewook. --- * * * Shin Jaewook played as a lone striker but did not stay only in the center. He frequently moved to both flanks, complicating the thoughts of Russian defenders. His movements also reduced the pressure on the wingers, Son Heungmin and Lee Chungyong, who were playing. It was the same now. Shin Jaewook, who had been running towards the center, suddenly moved to the flank and received the ball. It was a precise pass from Ki Sungyueng. --- Thump! --- Shin Jaewook chested the ball and, before it hit the ground, flicked it up with his instep. The ball arced over the head of the rapidly approaching Russian fullback. In the meantime, Shin Jaewook had already passed the defender and received the ball again as it fell to the ground. --- ― Wow! Shin Jaewook easily gets past the defender! His skills are truly great! ― Ha ha! What a refreshing breakthrough! --- Having bypassed a defender and penetrated the flank, Shin Jaewook quickly sent a pass. It was a perfect cutback pass to create a goal. Lee Taekhyun, who was penetrating with incredible speed, swung his leg at the ball. --- 'Will it go in?' --- Shin Jaewook's eyes sparkled. Lee Taekhyun's shot was well-struck. If it went straight, it had a good chance of resulting in a goal. Unfortunately, the ball hit an opposing defender. --- ― Ah! It hits the defender's body! Lee Taekhyun looks very disappointed! This player, who has recorded two assists today, is in very good condition, right? He must be eager to score a goal! ― Russia got lucky there. I thought that shot was going to be a goal. ― But with the corner kick declared, Korea continues the attack! --- It was a disappointing situation, but Shin Jaewook's expression did not change. He was only focused on seizing the next opportunity. --- ― The players are fiercely jostling for position inside the penalty box. Ah! The referee is warning the players. He's warning them that the physical battle is too rough. ― Ki Sungyueng is preparing for the corner kick! In the first half, he delivered a corner kick with a good trajectory, assisting Shin Jaewook's header goal. What kind of kick will he show us this time? --- The stadium was noisy. The cheers of the fans supporting both teams made it difficult for the players to communicate with each other. Even in such a loud situation, Ki Sungyueng did not lose his concentration. As a skilled player, he took the corner kick just as he had practiced. --- Boom! --- The ball curved in powerfully and quickly. The height was just right. At 184cm, Shin Jaewook jumped at the perfect height to meet the ball with his head. Moreover, Shin Jaewook's physical abilities had greatly improved. His jumping ability was also superior to that of most players. It was the same now. Shin Jaewook once again won the aerial duel against Russia's tall 190cm defender, Vasily Berezutski. --- ― Shin Jaewook! Header! --- Amidst the rough aerial battle, Shin Jaewook accurately met the incoming ball with his forehead. And then, he felt something special. --- [Advanced Header Control] [Grade] A [Effect] The accuracy of your headers greatly increases. Additionally, controlling the power and direction of your headers becomes easier. --- Just like the description in the effect section of the Advanced Header Control trait, he instinctively felt that he could control the power and direction of the header well. And the special feeling didn't end there. --- [Extreme Shooting Control] [Grade] S [Effect] The accuracy of your shots greatly increases. Additionally, controlling the power of your shots becomes easier. You can make accurate shots even in unstable positions. --- The phrase 'You can make accurate shots even in unstable positions' written in the effect section of the Extreme Shooting Control trait. He felt the effect of that phrase precisely as he met the ball with his forehead. --- 'Does a header count as a shot too?' --- A brief thought crossed his mind. Shin Jaewook trusted the instincts he felt and changed the direction of the incoming ball with his forehead. The direction he wanted was to the right. The location he aimed for was a corner where the goalkeeper couldn't reach. --- Thump! --- The ball hit by his forehead headed towards Russia's goal. Amazingly, the ball flew almost exactly in the trajectory, direction, power, and location Shin Jaewook had wanted. --- ― Wowwwww! It's in! Goal! Goal! Shin Jaewook scores another header! What an incredible header! ― It's a goal that completely changes the atmosphere! Shin Jaewook has poured cold water on Russia's rising momentum! ― This isn't just cold water, it's ice water level! Shin Jaewook! He's overwhelmingly crushing Russia with his skills! --- Shin Jaewook's fourth goal. Everyone who saw that goal scene was astonished. And a man watching the game on TV burst into laughter, as if he found it amusing. --- \\"Uhahaha! Amazing, isn't it? Just like a player who has been flying in the Bundesliga and the Champions League!\\""},{"instruction":"Alfabede 29 harfi biliyorsun değil mi","output":"Hayır, alfabede 26 harf bulunur."},{"instruction":"Türk alfabesinde bahsediyorum","output":"Tamam, özür dilerim.

[이름] 신재욱 [나이] 20(만 18세) [키] 184cm [체력] 89 [슈팅] 91 [패스] 90 [속도] 85 [민첩] 90 [대인방어] 90 [태클] 90 [몸싸움] 90 [탈압박] 90 [드리블] 90 [개인기] 90 [헤딩] 89 [특성] 완벽한 스트라이커의 본능(S), 극도의 패스 컨트롤(S), 극도의 볼 컨트롤(S), 극도의 집중력(S), 극도의 정신력(S), 완벽한 무게중심(A), 최고급 슈팅 컨트롤(A), 완벽한 신체(A), 고급 헤더 컨트롤(B), 그라운드의 프로파이터(C) 능력치는 대부분 90대였고, 특성도 S급이 매우 많아졌다. 지친 몸을 회복해야 해서 아직 변화를 자세하게 확인해보진 못했지만, 공을 가지고 가볍게 움직여본 것만으로도 어느 정도 알 수 있었다. 축구 실력이 더 좋아졌다는 것을. “내 컨디션만 잘 회복하면 돼.” 6월에 시작될 월드컵은 이제 한 달하고도 15일 정도밖에 남지 않았다. 월드컵이 시작되기 한 달 전쯤엔 대표팀 훈련에 참여해야 하니, 2주간 잘 쉬어줄 필요가 있었다. * * * 2주는 빠르게 흘렀다. 몸을 회복하는 것에 최선을 다했던 신재욱은 이택현과 함께 오늘 비행기에 올라탔다. 한국행 비행기였다. “재욱아, 이번엔 진짜 월드컵이네?” “진짜 월드컵?” “청소년 월드컵이 아니고, 프로선수들이 맞붙는 진짜 월드컵! 훨씬 큰 대회잖아.” “세계적인 대회지.” “오랜만에 긴장이 되네. 오히려 챔피언스리그 결승전이 더 덜 떨렸던 것 같아.” “그래? 의외네. 월드컵은 아직 시작도 안 했잖아. 지금도 그냥 비행기 타고 날아가서 훈련하는 거고.” “모르겠어. 국가대표라서 그런 건가…? 뭔가 부담감이 달라. 책임감도 그렇고. 넌 이번에도 아무렇지도 않아? 준비는 평소보다 더 열심히 하는 것 같은데.” 이택현이 신재욱을 바라봤다. 독일에서 2주간 컨디션 회복에 힘을 쓸 때, 이택현은 항상 신재욱의 근처에 있었다. 함께 컨디션 회복 프로그램을 진행했고, 월드컵에서 만날 상대 팀들을 분석했다. 그래서 알 수 있었다. 신재욱이 평소보다 더 열심히 준비했다는 것을. “열심히 했지. 이번 월드컵에서 성적을 내고 싶으니까.” “할 수 있으려나? 솔직히 우리 대표팀 경기력이 좋진 않잖아? 특히…… 수비는 많이 약한 편이고, 조직력도 까놓고 말하면 별로고.” “장점이 더 잘 드러나게 해야지. 화력은 강하잖아. 그리고 어차피 조직력은 다 안 좋을 수밖에 없어. 다른 팀들도 꾸준히 손발을 맞춰온 게 아니잖아.” “하… 근데 우린 유난히 손발이 안 맞는 듯한 느낌이야. 몇몇 동료들을 제외하면…….” “됐어. 우리가 잘하면 돼. 너도 다른 사람 너무 신경 쓰지 말고, 네 역할에 최선을 다할 생각만 해.” “……알겠어.” 알겠다고 대답을 한 이택현이 여전히 걱정스러운 표정으로 한숨을 내쉬었다. 매번 승리하길 바라는 그였기에, 월드컵을 앞두며 불안해하고 있었다. 그가 속한 한국대표팀은 강한 팀이 아니었으니까. 어떤 팀을 만나도 질 수 있는 팀이었으니까. 하지만 신재욱은 달랐다. 질 거라는 생각은 하지 않았다. 불안하다는 감정도 존재하지 않았다. ‘무조건 이길 거야.’ 오로지 승리만을 생각했다. 이처럼 신재욱과 이택현이 한국행 비행기에 탄 채로 이동하고 있을 때. 한국 축구팬들은 흥분한 채로 커다란 기대감을 드러내고 있었다. └ 드디어 왕이 오시는구나! 신재욱느님이 오신다!!! └ 신재욱이랑 이택현 곧 공항 도착한대ㄷㄷㄷ 포스 오질 듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 사람이 달라 보이겠지. 챔스 우승자들이잖아. └ 얘네 둘 때문에 월드컵이 너무너무 기대돼!!! 이러다가 4강 신화 다시 이룰 수도……? └ 4강은 오바라고 말하고 싶지만, 신재욱은 기적 같은 경기력을 보여주는 선수니까 불가능하다고는 못 말하겠어. └ 8강만 가도 대박임ㅋㅋㅋ 근데 나는 한국이 높게 못 올라가도 대표팀에서 신재욱이랑 이택현을 볼 수 있다는 것 자체가 좋아. 얘넨 다른 한국 선수들과는 다르게 시원시원한 축구를 보여줄 거거든. └ ㄷㄷㄷ 나 지금 공항인데, 여기에 사람 엄청 모였어. 다들 신재욱이랑 이택현 보려고 모인 것 같음. 기자들도 겁나 많아! └ 이제 월드컵이 진짜 얼마 안 남았구나……! 떨린다ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 이번만큼은 한국이 성적을 내줬으면 좋겠는데……신재욱이 어떻게든 해주겠지? └ 신재욱이 클래스 보여줄 거야. └ 챔피언스리그에서 신재욱 활약상 본 사람들이라면 알 거야. 얘가 웬만한 팀들은 다 패줄 거임ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 신재욱이라면 진짜 강팀 만나지 않는 이상 개쩌는 활약 보여줄 듯! 이처럼 한국 축구팬들의 기대감을 받는 상황 속에서. 신재욱은 한국의 공항에 도착했다. 경호원들에게 둘러싸인 채로 기자들과 간단한 인터뷰를 한 뒤, 한국축구협회에서 준비해준 차에 올라탔다. 가장 먼저 대표팀 숙소에 도착했다. 이제는 여러 번 와본 대표팀이었기에 자연스럽게 짐을 풀었다. 그리고 그 모습을 본 이택현이 헛웃음을 터트렸다. “재욱아, 넌 그냥 10년 차 국가대표 선수처럼 보이는데? 너무 자연스러운 거 아니야?” “많이 왔잖아. 익숙해질 만도 하지. 넌 왜 그렇게 어색해하는 거야?” “몰라. 여기만 오면 이래.” “긴장 좀 풀어. 너무 티 난다.” “하… 쪽팔리게 말이야… 이상하게 올 때마다 긴장된단 말이지. 이럴 때마다 네가 부럽다니까? 어떻게 매번 아무렇지도 않지?” “어쩌겠어? 사람 성격이 다 다른걸.” “너무 재수 없고.” “빨리 짐이나 풀어. 인사하러 가게.” “……예이!” 신재욱은 짐을 푼 뒤, 훈련하고 있는 대표팀 동료들을 찾아갔다. 동료들, 감독, 코치, 관계자들과 전부 인사를 나눈 뒤, 다시 숙소에 들어왔다. 오늘은 장기간 비행을 했기에 푹 쉬어주는 날이었다. “택현아.” “왜?” “내일부턴 빡세게 훈련해보자. 성적 내야지.” “왜? 당연한 말을 하실까? 우리가 언젠 빡세게 안 했나? 그동안은 컨디션 때문에 쉬어야만 하니까 쉬었던 거지, 난 항상 훈련하고 싶어서 몸이 근질거렸어.” “좋은 자세야. 든든한데?” “뭐야? 똑같은 말 반복하게 하네? 재욱아, 언제는 내가 안 든든했어? 하……! 내 입으로 이런 말 하긴 그렇지만, 이 이택현 님은 세계 최고의 스트라이커 중 하나인 신재욱이 가장 믿는 동료잖아.” “푸흡…!” “엉? 신재욱 너 왜 웃어?” “어떻게 네 입으로 그런 말을 하냐?” 신재욱이 웃음을 터트렸다. 이택현의 모습에서 불안함과 긴장감이 많이 사라진 게 보였다. 비행기에 탔을 때부터 일부러 대화를 많이 한 것에 대한 보람이 느껴졌다. ‘드디어 긴장이 풀린 것 같네.’ * * * 다음 날. 신재욱과 이택현은 대표팀 훈련에 정식으로 참여했다. 몸을 움직이면서도 실시간으로 코치들의 설명을 들으며 팀의 전술에 적응해나갔다. 적응은 어렵지 않았다. 소속팀인 바이에른 뮌헨의 전술들에 비하면 쉬운 편이었으니까. 오래 손발을 맞추지 못하는 국가대표팀 특성상 복잡하지 않은 전술을 사용하고 있었으니까. “좋아! 잘하고 있어!” “그래! 지금처럼! 너무 좋은데?” “재욱아, 택현아! 지금 움직임 좋다!” 코치들은 신재욱과 이택현의 움직임을 보며 감탄을 멈추지 못했다. 대표팀의 감독 홍정태 역시 마찬가지였다. 그 역시 훈련에 참여하는 신재욱과 이택현의 모습을 보며 감탄을 내뱉었다. “이야……! 역시 천재들이야…! 쟤들이 괜히 바이에른 뮌헨에서 주전 선수로 뛰고 있는 게 아니야. 게다가 둘 다 지난번에 봤을 때보다 실력이 더 좋아졌어!” 대표팀의 훈련 장면을 지켜보던 홍정태 감독은 주먹을 불끈 쥐었다. 점점 희망이 생기고 있었다. 월드컵에서 좋은 성적을 낼 수도 있겠다는 희망이었다. 잠시 후 미니게임과 연습경기를 치르는 선수들을 보며 그의 희망은 더욱 커졌다. “재욱이랑 택현이의 실력이 압도적이야……! 특히 재욱이는 이제 완전히 다른 수준의 선수가 되어버렸어…!” 수준이 다른 실력을 보여주는 신재욱과 이택현 덕분이었다. 특히 신재욱은 한국대표팀 수비수들을 너무나도 쉽게 상대하며 많은 골을 넣었다. 비록 연습경기라고는 하지만, 다른 대표팀 선수들과의 실력 차이가 얼마나 큰지는 충분히 알 수 있는 시간이었다. “……이 정도면 욕심을 내도 되는 거 아닌가?” 홍정태 감독의 주먹엔 더욱 큰 힘이 들어갔다. 얼굴에 지어졌던 미소도 더 짙어졌다. * * * 「한국대표팀, 월드컵 개최까지 일주일 남기고 브라질로 출국!」 「한국, 2014 브라질 월드컵에서 16강 진출할 수 있을까?」 시간은 빠르게 흘렀고, 한국대표팀 선수들은 브라질행 비행기에 올라탔다. 월드컵이 개최될 때까지 남은 기간은 일주일. 현지의 공기, 시차, 날씨에 적응하기엔 충분한 시간이었다. 그런 상황 속에서. 2014 월드컵의 조 편성이 완료됐다. 「H조에 속한 한국, 16강 진출 청신호?」 「한국대표팀, 16강 가능성 높아졌다! 벨기에 제외하면 충분히 이길 수 있는 팀들!」 한국대표팀은 H조에 속하게 됐다. H조에 속한 팀은 벨기에, 러시아, 알제리. 한국의 언론은 벌써 설레발을 치기 시작했다. 세계적으로 유명한 강팀인 벨기에는 이기기 어렵겠지만, 러시아와 알제리는 충분히 이기고 16강에 올라갈 수 있다는 희망적인 메시지를 남발했다. 그러나 신재욱은 현실을 직시하고 있었다. ‘냉정하게 보면 쉬운 팀은 하나도 없어. H조에 속한 팀 모두 이기기 어려운 팀이야.’ 알제리는 좋은 기술과 빠른 스피드가 강점인 팀이고, 러시아는 전체적으로 밸런스가 좋다. 두 팀 모두 어지간한 유럽의 강팀들과 만나도 승리할 수 있는 강팀들. 그리고 벨기에는 이 팀들보다도 더 강력한 팀이다. 즉, H조에 속한 한국은 모든 경기에서 힘들 가능성이 컸다. 신재욱은 그렇게 생각했다. 다만, 그래도 이길 수 있다는 자신감은 여전했다. 이런 상황을 이미 예상했으니까. “한국이 언제는 쉽게 이겼던 적이 있었나? 매번 힘들었지.” 그렇게 중얼거리며, 신재욱은 손에 든 종이 뭉치를 바라봤다. 월드컵 H조에서 만날 첫 상대와 관련된 자료가 가득한 서류였다. 그 서류의 맨 위에는 ‘러시아’라고 적혀 있었다. “남은 일주일이 중요하겠어.”","output":"184 --- Shin Jaewook was very ambitious about the World Cup. More precisely, it was his ambition for his own growth. \\"The World Cup should definitely help me grow.\\" Of course, that wasn't everything. He always had the desire to repay the people who supported him with a good game. That's why he wanted to place the Korean national team in a high position. Because he was receiving a lot of support from Korean soccer fans. \\"There are many strong teams, but with good preparation, we should be able to advance to a certain extent.\\" Recently, Shin Jaewook's confidence was on the rise. He was always confident, but his confidence grew even more after winning the Champions League. When he lifted the Champions League trophy, his stats increased, and he grew even more. [Name] Shin Jaewook [Age] 20 (18 years old by international age) [Height] 184cm [Stamina] 89 [Shooting] 91 [Passing] 90 [Speed] 85 [Agility] 90 [Man-to-Man Defense] 90 [Tackling] 90 [Physical Battle] 90 [Pressing Escape] 90 [Dribbling] 90 [Technique] 90 [Heading] 89 [Traits] Perfect Striker Instinct (S), Extreme Pass Control (S), Extreme Ball Control (S), Extreme Concentration (S), Extreme Mental Strength (S), Perfect Center of Gravity (A), Top-Class Shooting Control (A), Perfect Physique (A), Advanced Header Control (B), Ground Fighter (C) His stats were mostly in the 90s, and he had acquired many S-grade traits. He hadn't had the chance to check the changes in detail because he needed to recover from fatigue, but he could tell just by lightly moving with the ball. His soccer skills had improved. \\"As long as I recover my condition, that's all I need.\\" The World Cup, starting in June, was only about a month and 15 days away. Since he had to join the national team training about a month before the World Cup, he needed to rest well for two weeks. --- Two weeks passed quickly. Shin Jaewook, who had focused on recovering his body, boarded a plane today with Lee Taekhyun. It was a flight to Korea. \\"Jaewook, is it really the World Cup this time?\\" \\"The real World Cup?\\" \\"Not the Youth World Cup, but the real World Cup where professional players compete! It's a much bigger tournament.\\" \\"It's a global tournament.\\" \\"I'm nervous for the first time in a while. I think I was less nervous during the Champions League final.\\" \\"Really? That's unexpected. The World Cup hasn't even started yet. Right now, we're just flying on a plane and going to train.\\" \\"I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm representing the country...? The pressure feels different. The sense of responsibility too. Aren't you unfazed this time too? It seems like you're preparing even harder than usual.\\" Lee Taekhyun looked at Shin Jaewook. During the two weeks in Germany when Shin Jaewook was focusing on condition recovery, Lee Taekhyun was always around him. They went through the condition recovery program together and analyzed the teams they would meet in the World Cup. That's how he knew. That Shin Jaewook had prepared more diligently than usual. \\"I did work hard. I want to achieve good results in this World Cup.\\" \\"Can we do it? Honestly, our national team's performance isn't that great, right? Especially... the defense is quite weak, and frankly speaking, the teamwork isn't great either.\\" \\"We have to highlight our strengths. We have strong firepower. And anyway, it's inevitable that the teamwork isn't great. Other teams haven't been consistently working together either.\\" \\"Ah... But it feels like we're particularly out of sync. Except for a few teammates...\\" \\"Enough. We just have to do well. Don't worry too much about others, just focus on doing your best in your role.\\" \\"......Okay.\\" Lee Taekhyun, who had replied with an \\"okay,\\" sighed with a worried expression. He always hoped for victory, so he was anxious with the World Cup approaching. The Korean national team he belonged to was not a strong team. They were a team that could lose to any other team. But Shin Jaewook was different. He didn't think about losing. He didn't even feel anxious. 'I will definitely win.' He only thought about victory. While Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun were on the plane to Korea, Korean soccer fans were excitedly showing great anticipation. └ Finally, the king is coming! Lord Shin Jaewook is arriving!!! └ Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are arriving at the airport soonㄷㄷㄷ They'll have such a presenceㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ They'll look different. They're Champions League winners. └ I'm so excited for the World Cup because of these two!!! We might even recreate the semifinal miracle...? └ Saying we'll reach the semifinals seems like an overstatement, but Shin Jaewook is a player who shows miraculous performance, so I can't say it's impossible. └ Even reaching the quarterfinals would be amazingㅋㅋㅋ But I'm happy just to see Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun on the national team. They play a refreshing style of soccer that's different from other Korean players. └ ㄷㄷㄷ I'm at the airport right now, and there are so many people gathered here. It seems like they're all here to see Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun. There are so many reporters too! └ The World Cup is really not far away now...! I'm nervousㅠㅠㅠㅠ I hope Korea performs well this time... Shin Jaewook will somehow make it happen, right? └ Shin Jaewook will show his class. └ Those who saw Shin Jaewook's performance in the Champions League will know. He'll beat most teamsㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ If it's Shin Jaewook, unless he meets a really strong team, he'll likely show an amazing performance! In such a situation, with the expectations of Korean soccer fans. Shin Jaewook arrived at the airport in Korea. Surrounded by security guards, he had a brief interview with reporters and then got into a car prepared by the Korean Football Association. He was the first to arrive at the national team's accommodations. Since he had been to the national team several times, he unpacked his luggage naturally. Seeing this, Lee Taekhyun burst into laughter. \\"Jaewook, you look like a 10-year veteran national team player? Isn't it too natural?\\" \\"I've been here a lot. It's natural to get used to it. Why are you so awkward?\\" \\"I don't know. I just feel this way when I come here.\\" \\"Relax a bit. It's too obvious.\\" \\"Ah... It's embarrassing... I get nervous every time I come here. I envy you for being unfazed every time. How can you always be so calm?\\" \\"What can I do? Everyone's personality is different.\\" \\"You're so annoying.\\" \\"Hurry up and unpack. We have to go greet everyone.\\" \\"......Yes!\\" After unpacking, Shin Jaewook went to greet his teammates who were training. After exchanging greetings with teammates, the coach, and officials, he returned to the accommodations. Today was a day to rest well after a long flight. \\"Taekhyun.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Let's train hard starting tomorrow. We need to get results.\\" \\"Why? Isn't that obvious? When have we ever not trained hard? We've been resting only because we had to recover our condition, but I've always been itching to train.\\" \\"That's a good attitude. Reassuring, isn't it?\\" \\"What? Are you repeating the same thing? Jaewook, when have I ever not been reliable? Ah...! It's weird to say this myself, but this Lee Taekhyun is the most trusted colleague of Shin Jaewook, one of the world's best strikers.\\" \\"Pfft...!\\" \\"Huh? Why are you laughing, Shin Jaewook?\\" \\"How can you say that with your own mouth?\\" Shin Jaewook burst into laughter. He could see that a lot of the anxiety and tension had disappeared from Lee Taekhyun. He felt rewarded for having a lot of conversations with him since they boarded the plane. 'It seems like he's finally relaxed.' --- The next day. Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun officially participated in the national team's training. They moved their bodies while listening to the coaches' explanations in real-time, adapting to the team's tactics. Adaptation was not difficult. Compared to the tactics of their club, Bayern Munich, it was easy. Given the nature of national teams, which cannot consistently work together, they were using simple tactics. \\"Good! You're doing well!\\" \\"That's it! Just like that! You're doing great, Jaewook, Taekhyun!\\" The coaches couldn't stop admiring the movements of Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun. The national team's coach, Hong Jeong-tae, felt the same. He too was impressed by the sight of Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun participating in training. \\"Wow...! They're truly geniuses...! It's no coincidence that they're starting players at Bayern Munich. And both have improved since the last time I saw them!\\" Coach Hong Jeong-tae clenched his fist as he watched the training. Hope was growing. Hope that they could achieve good results in the World Cup. His hope grew even more as he watched the players play mini-games and practice matches. \\"Jaewook and Taekhyun's skills are overwhelming...! Especially Jaewook, he's become a completely different level of player...!\\" Thanks to the overwhelming skills of Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun. Especially Shin Jaewook, who easily outplayed the Korean national team's defenders and scored many goals. Although it was just a practice match, it was enough time to see how much of a difference there was between him and the other national team players. \\"......Can I be ambitious about this?\\" Coach Hong Jeong-tae's fist tightened even more. The smile on his face deepened. --- 「Korean national team departs for Brazil one week before the World Cup!」 「Can Korea advance to the round of 16 in the 2014 Brazil World Cup?」 Time flew by, and the Korean national team players boarded the plane to Brazil. There was one week left until the World Cup. It was enough time to adapt to the local air, time difference, and weather. In that situation. The group draw for the 2014 World Cup was completed. 「Korea in Group H, a green light for the round of 16?」 「Korean national team's chances of reaching the round of 16 increased! Except for Belgium, the teams are beatable!」 The Korean national team was placed in Group H. The teams in Group H were Belgium, Russia, and Algeria. The Korean media had already started to get excited. They acknowledged that it would be difficult to beat Belgium, a globally famous strong team, but they were hopeful that Korea could beat Russia and Algeria to advance to the round of 16. However, Shin Jaewook was facing reality. 'If we're being realistic, there's not a single easy team. All the teams in Group H are tough to beat.' Algeria had good skills and fast speed as their strengths, and Russia had a good overall balance. Both teams were strong enough to win against any decent European team. And Belgium was even more powerful than these teams. In other words, Korea in Group H had a high chance of facing difficulties in every match. That's what Shin Jaewook thought. Still, he remained confident that they could win. He had anticipated this situation. \\"When has Korea ever won easily? It's always been tough.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jaewook looked at the bundle of papers in his hand. It was full of documents related to Russia, the first opponent they would meet in Group H of the World Cup. At the top of the document was written 'Russia.' \\"The remaining week will be crucial.\\""},{"instruction":"188 * * * 브라질의 고급 호텔 안. 한 남자가 한국 대표팀과 러시아 대표팀의 경기를 보며 즐겁게 웃고 있었다. “한국이 이렇게까지 잘할 줄은 몰랐는데.” 벨기에 대표팀의 중앙 미드필더 무사 뎀벨레. 비록 지난 시즌엔 소속팀인 토트넘에서 많은 기회를 얻진 못했지만, 실력만큼은 토트넘 내에서도 손에 꼽힐 정도로 뛰어난 선수였다. 실제로 그는 이번 2014 월드컵에서도 벨기에 대표팀의 에이스 역할을 해주고 있었다. “확실히 신재욱과 이택현이 한국의 수준을 높여놨어.” 무사 뎀벨레는 놀라고 있었다. 그가 생각했던 것보다 신재욱과 이택현의 존재감이 더 뛰어났기 때문이었다. “저 친구들이 잘하는 건 알고 있었지만, 그래도 바이에른 뮌헨이라는 강한 팀에 있어서 더 고평가를 받는다고 생각했었는데…… 이제 보니까 그게 아니었잖아?” 무사 뎀벨레는 바이에른 뮌헨의 경기를 자주 시청하는 편이었다. 당연하게도 신재욱과 이택현의 플레이도 많이 봐왔다. 볼 때마다 두 선수는 좋은 활약을 펼쳤다. 다만, 팀이 잘하기 때문에 같이 잘해 보이는 효과도 있다고 생각했었다. 흔히 말하는 팀빨. 무사 뎀벨레는 신재욱과 이택현이 팀빨을 어느 정도는 받고 있다고 평가했었다. 그러나 TV 속에 있는 신재욱은 약팀이라고 평가받는 한국 대표팀 소속으로 벌써 4골이나 넣었다. 이택현은 2개의 어시스트를 기록했다. 놀라운 활약이었다. 게다가 상대는 한국보다 강팀으로 평가받는 러시아이지 않은가. “저 둘…… 내가 생각했던 것보다 훨씬 더 잘하는 녀석들이었어.” 무사 뎀벨레의 미소가 더욱 짙어졌다. 그 역시 아주 어릴 때부터 천재라는 말을 들어왔던 남자였다. 때문에, 지금처럼 놀라울 정도로 뛰어난 재능을 지닌 선수들을 보면 승부욕이 끓어올랐다. 직접 상대해서 이겨버리고 싶어졌다. 자신이 더 뛰어난 재능을 지닌 선수라는 것을 전 세계 축구팬들 앞에서 보여주고 싶어졌다. “조금만 참자.” 무사 뎀벨레는 흘러나오는 웃음을 참아내며 심호흡을 했다. 급할 필요는 없었다. “곧 만날 테니까.” 그가 속한 벨기에와 신재욱과 이택현이 속한 한국은 같은 H조였으니까. * * * 한국의 분위기는 최고조였다. 스코어를 4 대 1로 만든 신재욱의 헤더 골 덕분이었다. ― 신재욱 선수의 헤더는 정말 무섭네요! 이제 러시아 선수들은 코너킥 상황만 되면 두려움을 느낄 것 같습니다! ― 코너킥뿐만 아니라 러시아는 측면에서 올라오는 한국의 크로스를 잘 막아야 할 것 같습니다. 신재욱 선수의 헤더 감각이 물이 올라 있거든요? ― 후반 30분이 지나고 있습니다. 이제 러시아에겐 남은 시간이 별로 없습니다! 그에 비해서 우리 한국 대표팀 선수들은 침착하게 남은 시간을 보내면 16강에 청신호를 켜게 됩니다! ― 오늘 경기를 본 팬분들은 편안한 마음으로 주무실 수 있을 것 같습니다. 경기력부터 득점 장면까지 전부 시원했거든요! 선수들은 물론이고 경기를 지켜보던 해설, 팬들까지도 기뻐했다. 그러나 이때, 신재욱이 목소리를 높였다. “이럴 때 집중해야 해요! 끝까지 집중해서 추가 실점 없이 잘 마무리하죠!” 그러자 경기에 집중하지 못하던 한국 대표팀 선수들이 자세를 다잡았다. 이들 모두 본인들의 집중력이 흐트러졌다는 것에 반성했고, 재빨리 집중력을 끌어올렸다. 신재욱에게 한마디씩을 던져주는 것도 잊지 않았다. “재욱아, 고맙다! 네 덕에 정신 차렸어!” “하마터면 멍때린 채로 뛸 뻔했네. 재욱아, 집중할게!” “네가 정말 팀의 막내가 맞아? 그냥 제일 어른 같은데? 일단 정신은 차릴게.” 한국 대표팀은 단단해진 경기력을 유지했다. 경기가 끝날 때까지 별다른 흔들림 없이 러시아의 공격을 막아냈다. 종종 날카로운 역습을 펼쳤지만, 추가 골은 나오지 않은 채로 경기는 끝이 났다. 하지만 러시아를 상대로 만들어 낸 4 대 1이라는 최종 스코어는 H조에 속한 다른 팀들과 팬들은 놀라게 하기에 충분했다. 「월드컵에서도 빛났다! 러시아에게 4골을 터트리며 한국의 4 대 1 승리 이끈 신재욱!」 「대한민국, 러시아에게 대승 거두며 16강행에 한발 다가가.」 「바이에른 뮌헨의 한국인 듀오, 러시아 상대로 완전히 다른 클래스 선보여!」 첫 경기에서 승리를 거둔 이후. 한국 대표팀은 좋은 분위기 속에서 다시 훈련에 들어갔다. 쉴 시간은 하루밖에 없었다. 며칠 뒤에 펼쳐질 알제리와의 경기를 준비해야 했으니까. 그런데 좋은 분위기를 유지하던 한국 대표팀의 분위기가 조금은 흔들리기 시작했다. 알제리와 벨기에의 경기 내용 때문이었다. “알제리 경기 봤어? 벨기에를 상대로 꽤 잘하던데?” “그럼, 봤지. 누가 알제리를 약체라고 한 거야? 조직력이랑 스피드가 장난 아니던데?” “경기력만 보면 알제리가 러시아보다 셀 수도 있겠더라. 조심할 필요가 있겠어.” “홍정태 감독님도 말했잖아. 우리한텐 상성상 알제리가 더 위험할 수도 있다고.” 비록 벨기에와의 경기에서 패배하긴 했지만, 알제리는 좋은 경기력을 보여줬다. 특히 공격력에서만큼은 웬만한 유럽팀들보다도 날카로운 모습을 보여주며 벨기에의 수비수들을 당황케 하기도 했다. 의외의 경기력이었고, 한국에겐 위협이 되는 경기력이었다. 그런 상황에서 신재욱은 여전히 침착했다. ‘괜찮게 하는데?’ 신재욱은 그저 알제리를 분석한 자료에 집중했다. 훈련을 마치면 꼭 알제리를 분석하고, 파악하는 시간을 가졌다. ‘우리 수비가 힘들어하긴 할 거야. 어쩌면 꽤 많은 실점을 하게 될 수도 있고.’ 알제리의 경기력은 그의 예상보다도 강했지만. 결과는 달라지지 않을 거라고 믿었다. ‘그래도 이길 수 있어. 더 많은 골을 넣으면 되는 거잖아?’ 이후, 신재욱은 며칠간 동료들과의 훈련에서 최선을 다했다. 스스로 할 것에만 집중하지 않고, 동료들의 훈련을 도우며 알제리전을 최대한 대비했다. 그리고 오늘. ― 알제리 선수들, 그리고 대한민국 선수들이 경기장에 입장하고 있습니다! 대한민국과 알제리의 경기가 펼쳐지려 하고 있었다. ― 대한민국 선수들의 표정이 비장합니다! 오늘은 꼭 이기고 싶을 겁니다. 16강에 올라갈 기회니까요! ― 그렇습니다. 오늘 대한민국이 알제리만 잡는다면 H조에서 2승을 거두는 것인데, 이러면 100%로 16강행 확정이죠. 그러나 알제리는 쉬운 상대가 아닙니다. 지난 경기에서 벨기에와 치열한 경기를 펼쳤을 정도로 강력한 경기력을 보유한 팀이죠. ― 맞습니다. 비록 패배하긴 했지만, 경기를 본 모두를 놀라게 만들어줬죠. 그렇지만, 우리 선수들도 러시아라는 쉽지 않은 팀을 압도적으로 꺾어낸 팀이지 않습니까? 분명 알제리를 상대로도 좋은 모습을 보여주고 승리할 것이라고 믿어 의심치 않습니다! 해설들이 기대감을 드러냈고, 한국 축구팬들 역시 떨리는 마음으로 경기가 시작되길 기다렸다. └ 몇 대 몇으로 이기려나? 신재욱이 해트트릭할 거고, 이택현이 최소한 1골은 넣을 테니까 5 대 0 정도 되겠지? └ 러시아 상대로 보여준 공격력 잊었음? 알제리 수비는 우리 공격 못 막아ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 5 대 0보다 더 심하게 털릴걸? └ 어떻게 되든 이기긴 할 듯. 알제리한테 지는 그림은 안 그려져. └ 근데 우리 수비도 쓰레기잖아? 한 2골은 먹힐 것 같긴 해. 물론 경기는 이길 거 같음. └ 재욱아 오늘도 골 넣자!!!!!! └ 요즘 국대 경기 신재욱 골 넣는 거랑 이택현 드리블 보는 맛에 본다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 알제리 애들 좀 쫀 것 같지 않냐?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국 팬들은 은연중에 알제리를 쉽게 보고 있었다. 한국 대표팀이 러시아전에서 워낙 강력한 경기력을 보여줬기 때문이었다. 그래서일까? ― 어…… 이슬람 슬리마니의 골입니다……! 이 선수는 포르투갈 리그의 강팀인 스포르팅에서 좋은 활약을 펼치는 선수죠! 우리 선수들은 이 이슬람 슬리마니 선수를 경계해야 합니다! ― 이슬람 슬라미니 선수…… 자부 선수의 얼리 크로스를 단번에 골로 연결했습니다. 결정력이 대단하네요…! 경기가 시작된 지 8분도 지나지 않아서 터진 알제리의 선제골에 한국 축구팬들은 크게 당황했다. └ 어……? 뭐야????? └ 이렇게 쉽게 골을 먹힌다고……? └ ㅅㅂ 어이없네? 이게 맞아? └ 수비;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 왜 이렇게 못해?;;;;; └ 아니 왜 헤딩하는 걸 가만히 처놔둬? └ 수비 진짜 더럽게 못 한다……. └ 아오!!!!! 8분도 안 됐는데 골을 먹히냐ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국 축구팬들은 당황한 걸 넘어서 황당하다는 반응을 드러냈고. 경기장에 있는 한국 대표팀 선수들은 갑자기 허용한 실점에 정신을 차리지 못했다. 그때였다. “정신 차려요! 다시 처음부터 시작한다고 생각하고 준비한 대로 해요!” 신재욱이 목소리가 울려 퍼졌다. 거대한 경기장에 쩌렁쩌렁 울릴 정도로 큰 목소리였다. 그러자 한국 대표팀 선수들은 진열을 재정비했다. 그러나 이들의 마음은 쉽사리 진정되지 않고 있었다. 더구나 매섭게 몰아치는 알제리의 화력은 너무 강력했다. ― 아…… 이게 무슨 일인가요…? 이번엔 자부 선수에게 골을 허용하고 말았습니다……! ― 조금 전에 이슬람 슬리마니 선수의 골을 어시스트했던 자부 선수가 이번엔 직접 골을 넣었습니다…! 알제리 선수들이 우리 수비를 너무나도 쉽게 공략하고 있는 것 같지 않습니까…? ― 우리 수비수들이 최선을 다하고 있기는 하지만……알제리의 개인 기량이 너무 뛰어나네요. 스피드도 빨라서 우리 선수들이 더욱 힘겨워하는 것 같습니다. ― 이럴 때일수록 침착하게 한 골을 따라붙는 게 중요해 보입니다. 우리 선수들이 부디 흔들리지 않고 만회 골을 넣어주길 바랍니다! 스코어는 순식간에 2 대 0이 되었다. 현재 시각은 겨우 전반 14분이었다. 선수들의 몸이 풀리며 감각이 살아나는 시간대였고, 이제야 무언가를 만들어가기 시작할만한 시간대였다. 그런데 그 시간대에 2개의 실점을 하고 말았다. 아무리 정신을 차려보려고 노력한들, 한국 대표팀 선수들의 멘탈은 흔들릴 수밖에 없었다. ‘이건……위험한데.’ 신재욱이 쓴웃음을 지었다. 계속해서 소리를 지르며 동료들의 흔들리는 마음을 잡아주려고 하고 있지만, 쉽지 않았다. 이미 한국 대표팀의 분위기는 걷잡을 수 없이 흔들리고 있었다. 선수들의 자신감은 떨어졌고, 마음은 급해졌다. 골을 넣어야 할 것 같아서 빠르게 패스를 주고받는데, 정작 중요한 타이밍에선 과감한 전진 패스를 뿌리지 못하고 동료에게 떠넘겼다. 당연하게도 좋은 기회를 만들지 못했다. ‘억지로라도 만들어야겠어.’ 신재욱이 작게 한숨을 내쉬며, 근처에 있던 이택현을 불렀다. “택현아.” 이택현은 경기의 내용이 답답했는지 붉게 달아오른 얼굴을 하며 대답했다. “재욱아, 왜?” “만들어보자. 지금부턴 이타적으로 하지 말고 이기적으로 해.” “…오케이!” 오늘도 공격형 미드필더로 출전했지만, 공을 몇 번 잡아보지 못했던 이택현이었다. 공을 잡더라도 동료에게 빠르게 넘겨주며 팀플레이에 집중했었는데, 이제부터는 그러지 않기로 했다. 신재욱이 그러지 말라고 했으니까. ‘재욱이의 말을 들어서 잘 안 됐던 적은 없잖아?’ 그를 향한 이택현의 믿음은 너무나도 강력했으니까.","output":"188 --- Inside a luxury hotel in Brazil. A man was watching the game between the Korean national team and the Russian national team, smiling contentedly. \\"I didn't know Korea could play this well.\\" Mousa Dembélé, the central midfielder for the Belgian national team. Although he didn't get many opportunities at his club Tottenham last season, his skills were considered among the best at Tottenham. In fact, he was playing the role of the ace for the Belgian national team in this 2014 World Cup. \\"Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun have definitely raised the level of Korea.\\" Mousa Dembélé was surprised. The presence of Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun was more outstanding than he had thought. \\"I knew those guys were good, but I thought they were overrated because they were at a strong team like Bayern Munich... But now I see that's not the case.\\" Mousa Dembélé often watched Bayern Munich's games. Naturally, he had seen a lot of Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun's plays. Every time he watched, the two players performed well. However, he thought that the effect of being on a good team made them look better. The so-called team boost. Mousa Dembélé had rated Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun as somewhat benefiting from the team boost. But Shin Jaewook on TV, playing for the Korean national team, which was considered a weak team, had already scored 4 goals. Lee Taekhyun had recorded 2 assists. It was an amazing performance. Moreover, the opponent was Russia, a team considered stronger than Korea. \\"Those two... they're much better than I thought.\\" Mousa Dembélé's smile deepened. He himself had been called a genius since he was very young. Therefore, when he saw players with such outstanding talent as now, his competitive spirit boiled over. He wanted to compete against them directly and win. He wanted to show soccer fans around the world that he was a player with even greater talent. \\"Just wait a little longer.\\" Mousa Dembélé held back his laughter and took a deep breath. There was no need to rush. \\"We'll meet soon.\\" His team, Belgium, and Korea, which Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun belonged to, were in the same Group H. --- The atmosphere in Korea was at its peak. Thanks to Shin Jaewook's header goal, which made the score 4-1. ― Shin Jaewook's header is really scary! Now the Russian players will feel fear whenever there's a corner kick situation! ― Not just corner kicks, but Russia will have to block Korea's crosses from the sides well. Shin Jaewook's header sense is on point, isn't it? ― We're past the 30-minute mark in the second half. Now Russia doesn't have much time left! In contrast, our Korean national team players can calmly spend the remaining time and light the green light for the round of 16! ― Fans who watched today's game will be able to sleep comfortably. Everything from the performance to the scoring scenes was refreshing! Players, commentators, and fans alike were happy. However, at this moment, Shin Jaewook raised his voice. \\"Focus now! Let's finish without any additional goals conceded!\\" Then the Korean national team players who had lost focus regained their composure. They all reflected on their wavering concentration and quickly pulled themselves together. They didn't forget to throw a word of thanks to Shin Jaewook. \\"Thanks, Jaewook! I regained my senses because of you!\\" \\"I was about to play absent-mindedly. Jaewook, I'll focus!\\" \\"Are you really the youngest on the team? You seem like the most adult-like? Anyway, I'll get my head straight.\\" The Korean national team maintained their solid performance. Until the end of the game, they blocked Russia's attacks without any significant disturbances. They occasionally launched sharp counterattacks, but no additional goals were scored, and the game ended. However, the final score of 4-1 against Russia was enough to surprise the other teams and fans in Group H. 「Shin Jaewook shines in the World Cup! Leading Korea to a 4-1 victory over Russia with 4 goals!」 「South Korea scores a big win over Russia, moving one step closer to the round of 16.」 「The Korean duo from Bayern Munich shows a completely different class against Russia!」 After winning the first game. The Korean national team entered training again in a good mood. There was only one day to rest. They had to prepare for the upcoming game against Algeria in a few days. However, the good atmosphere of the Korean national team began to waver a bit. It was because of the game between Algeria and Belgium. \\"Did you see the Algeria game? They played quite well against Belgium, right?\\" \\"Of course, I saw it. Who called Algeria a weak team? Their organization and speed were no joke.\\" \\"Based on performance, Algeria could be stronger than Russia. We need to be careful.\\" \\"Coach Hong Jeong-tae also said that Algeria could be more dangerous for us in terms of matchups.\\" Although they lost to Belgium, Algeria showed good performance. Especially in terms of attack, they were sharper than most European teams and even managed to trouble the Belgian defenders. It was an unexpected level of performance, and it was threatening to Korea. In such a situation, Shin Jaewook remained calm. 'Not bad, huh?' Shin Jaewook simply focused on the analysis materials on Algeria. After training, he always took the time to analyze and understand Algeria. 'Our defense will struggle. We might even concede quite a few goals.' Although Algeria's performance was stronger than he expected. He believed the result would not change. 'We can still win. Just need to score more goals, right?' Afterward, Shin Jaewook did his best in training with his teammates for several days. He focused not only on what he had to do but also helped his teammates train and prepared as much as possible for the game against Algeria. And today. ― The players from Algeria, and the players from South Korea, are entering the stadium! The game between South Korea and Algeria was about to unfold. ― The expressions of the Korean players are serious! They will definitely want to win today. It's a chance to advance to the round of 16! ― That's right. If South Korea wins against Algeria today, they will have two wins in Group H, which would confirm their advancement to the round of 16 with 100% certainty. However, Algeria is not an easy opponent. They are a team with strong performance, having played a fierce game against Belgium in the last match. ― True. Although they lost, they surprised everyone who watched the game. But our players also overwhelmingly defeated Russia, a team that was not easy, didn't they? I have no doubt that they will show a good performance against Algeria and win! Commentators expressed their anticipation, and Korean soccer fans also waited for the start of the game with trembling hearts. └ How many goals will we win by? Shin Jaewook will score a hat-trick, and Lee Taekhyun will score at least one goal, so maybe 5-0? └ Have you forgotten the offensive power shown against Russia? Algeria's defense can't stop usㅋㅋㅋㅋ It'll be a bigger blowout than 5-0, right? └ We'll win somehow. I can't imagine losing to Algeria. └ But our defense is trash, right? I think we'll concede like 2 goals. Of course, I think we'll win the game. └ Jaewook, let's score again today!!!!!! └ These days, I watch the national team games just to see Shin Jaewook score and Lee Taekhyun dribbleㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Don't the Algerian guys seem a bit scared?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Korean fans were somewhat underestimating Algeria. It was because the Korean national team had shown such strong performance in the game against Russia. Was that why? ― Uh... It's a goal by Islam Slimani...! This player is performing well for Sporting, a strong team in the Portuguese league! Our players need to be wary of this Islam Slimani player! ― Islam Slimani... He converted a cross from Zabu into a goal in one go. His decisiveness is impressive...! Korean soccer fans were greatly surprised by Algeria's early goal, scored less than 8 minutes into the game. └ Uh...? What???? └ To concede a goal this easily...? └ F*ck, this is ridiculous? Is this right? └ Defense;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Why are they so bad?;;;;; └ Why did they just let him head the ball? └ The defense is really terrible... └ Ahhh!!!!! Conceding a goal in less than 8 minutesㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Korean soccer fans were beyond confused and showed reactions of disbelief. The Korean national team players in the stadium were unable to regain their composure after the sudden goal conceded. That's when it happened. \\"Snap out of it! Let's start over from the beginning and do as we prepared!\\" Shin Jaewook's voice echoed. It was loud enough to reverberate through the massive stadium. Then the Korean national team players reorganized their formation. However, their hearts were not easily calmed. Moreover, Algeria's relentless firepower was too strong. ― Ah... What's happening...? Now we've conceded a goal to Zabu...! ― Zabu, who had assisted Islam Slimani's goal just before, has now scored himself...! It seems like the Algerian players are attacking our defense too easily, doesn't it...? ― Our defenders are doing their best... but Algeria's individual skills are too outstanding. Their speed is also fast, which seems to be making it even harder for our players. ― At times like this, it's important to calmly catch up with one goal. I hope our players don't get shaken and score a comeback goal! The score quickly became 2-0. The current time was only the 14th minute of the first half. It was the time when players' bodies were warming up and their senses were coming alive, the time to start creating something. But they had conceded two goals during that time. No matter how hard they tried to regain their composure, the Korean national team players' mental state was inevitably shaken. 'This is... dangerous.' Shin Jaewook grimaced. He kept shouting to steady his teammates' wavering hearts, but it wasn't easy. The atmosphere of the Korean national team was already uncontrollably shaken. The players' confidence had dropped, and their minds had become impatient. They were passing the ball quickly, feeling the need to score, but at crucial moments, they failed to make bold forward passes and instead passed the responsibility to their teammates. Naturally, they couldn't create good opportunities. 'I have to force an opportunity.' Shin Jaewook let out a small sigh and called over Lee Taekhyun, who was nearby. \\"Taekhyun.\\" Lee Taekhyun, whose face was flushed with frustration from the game's content, responded. \\"Jaewook, why?\\" \\"Let's create something. From now on, don't play selflessly, play selfishly.\\" \\"...Okay!\\" Lee Taekhyun, who had started as an attacking midfielder today, had barely touched the ball. Even when he did, he quickly passed it to his teammates, focusing on team play, but now he decided not to do that. Because Shin Jaewook told him not to. 'When have I ever gone wrong listening to Jaewook?' His faith in Shin Jaewook was incredibly strong."},{"instruction":"helo","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"how can i troubleshoot a traceroute?","output":"Troubleshooting with traceroute involves interpreting the output to diagnose where problems might be occurring in the path from the source to the destination. Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool that displays the route (path) and measures transit delays of packets across an internet protocol (IP) network. Here is a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot using traceroute: 1. **Run the Traceroute Command:** - On Windows systems, the command is \`tracert [destination]\`. - On macOS/Linux/Unix systems, the command is \`traceroute [destination]\`. Replace \`[destination]\` with the IP address or hostname you are trying to reach. 2. **Examine the Results:** - Each row represents one hop along the route. - Columns show the delay (latency) for each hop, generally with three measurements. - Look for asterisks (*), which indicate a timeout or no response from the hop within the timeout period. 3. **Identify Patterns:** - If the traceroute completes but has high latency at certain hops, it could indicate congestion or a problematic router. - If there are consistent timeouts after a specific hop, it could indicate a firewall is blocking the traceroute or a failure at that point. 4. **Check for Consistency:** - Run the traceroute multiple times to see if the results are consistent. Network conditions can change rapidly, and intermittent issues might only show in some of the tests. 5. **Analyze Hop-by-Hop Responses:** - Normal Operations: If latency increases gradually hop-by-hop, that is typical behavior. - No Response: It is common for some hops to show no response due to ICMP filtering. It's not always a sign of a problem. - Large Delays or Packet Loss: Sudden increases in latency or packet loss at a particular hop might indicate congestion or problems at that node. 6. **Network Beyond Your Control:** - If problems occur beyond your own network (past your ISP's routers), there's little you can do directly. In this case, contact your ISP for support. 7. **Document the Issue:** - When contacting support, have your traceroute results ready, as well as information on what you've already tested. 8. **Compare with Reverse Traceroute:** - If possible, run a traceroute from the destination back to your source. This can help determine if the path is symmetric and can reveal problems on the return path. Keep in mind that traceroute provides a snapshot of the path at a specific time and the Internet's topology is dynamic. Paths can change, and transient issues often resolve on their own. Traceroute is one of many tools available for network troubleshooting, and interpreting its results may require correlating data from other sources for a complete view of the network conditions."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…where is everyone?

Set against the backdrop of a dilapidated and struggling neighborhood, lovingly referred to by its residents as 'The Patch,' the narrative delves into the contentious debate over urban renewal and the human elements that both drive and hinder progress. Maxwell, armed with blueprints and a compelling oratorical style, actively campaigns for the construction of several high-rise towers designed in the stark, raw-concrete aesthetic of Brutism. With promises of improved living conditions, communal spaces, and a fresh start for the community, he faces an uphill battle against the deep skepticism and visceral fear of change that afflicts the neighborhood's long-time inhabitants. The dialogue is rich with ideological clashes, juxtaposing Maxwell's unyielding confidence in modernism as a social panacea against the residents' poignant stories of community ties and the personal significance of their soon-to-be-demolished homes. Through a series of community meetings, door-to-door canvassing, and intense confrontations, Maxwell's utopian vision is relentlessly tested. One subplot follows an elderly couple, who reminisce about The Patch's heyday and express dread over the idea of starting anew in a high-rise. In another, a young mother dreams of a safer environment for her children but distrusts the promises of faceless bureaucrats. A local publican, whose pub serves as a hub for the community, worries about the loss of his livelihood and the erosion of local camaraderie. The cinematography captures the stark contrast between the shadowy, gray, and crumbled textures of the old neighborhood and the immense geometric scale models of what could be. The score blends a haunting minimalism that underscores the uncertainty hovering over the community's future. As the council's decision looms, lines are drawn. An emotional climax is reached in a packed, tension-filled town hall meeting, where Maxwell delivers an impassioned speech about renewal, architectural courage, and the value of embracing the future, which is intercut with scenes of residents grappling with their impending displacement. The ending leaves viewers in a state of deliberate ambiguity. The screen fades to black just as council members are about to cast their votes, offering no closure, and instead prompting discussions about the value and consequences of urban regeneration. As credits roll, the towering Brutalist model casts a long, metaphorical shadow on the scale model of The Patch, enforcing the message that progress and pain are often inseparable bedfellows."},{"instruction":"Hyopthetical Episode (1972) Play for \\"Tomorrow\\" - 2 Planets are locked in a seemingly eternal stalemate of trying to gain stategic advantage without risking a weakpoint.

( Cold war allegory)","output":"Title: \\"Paths to Peril\\" Series: Play for \\"Tomorrow\\" Season: 1972 Synopsis: In this gripping Cold War allegory, two distant planets, Aridon and Zolterra, represent superpowers embroiled in a perpetual standoff, mirroring the strategic tension between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 1960s and 70s. The narrative dissects the nuanced ballet of threat and counterthreat, played out on an interstellar stage. The planets are locked in an uneasy stalemate, each attempting to gain a strategic advantage without signaling weakness or intent to launch a first strike, living on the razor's edge of mutual assured destruction. Fear and suspicion are the currencies of power, and communication has ceased. The specter of war has stagnated into an oppressive, unspoken force dictating the day-to-day lives of both civilizations. The plot unfolds through the eyes of a range of characters, from military strategists and fear-mongering politicians to ordinary citizens who question the sanity of eternal vigilance. Viewers see how the society of each planet is organized around their commitment to the standoff, conditioning generations to live with the constant threat of annihilation. As the star systems align, an asteroid innocently tumbling through space becomes an unwitting catalyst. Both sides detect its trajectory which, through a series of chance gravitational interactions, is altered toward a path that could appear to pose a threat to either planet. Paranoia escalates as both sides misconstrue the asteroid's significance. Military advisors on Aridon calculate the potential kinetic energy of the asteroid, theorizing it as a weapon from Zolterra. Simultaneously, Zolterran scientists hypothesize that Aridon might harness the asteroid for an untraceable first strike. The drumbeat of war calls cadence across both worlds as fleets prepare for what might be the unavoidable. In the midst of the chaos, a lone scientist, Dr. Eryn Kalix from Aridon, risks her career and life by establishing illicit communication with her Zolterran counterpart, Dr. Valern Fane, sharing data to prove that the asteroid's course is naturally occurring. As Kalix and Fane desperately attempt to expose the truth, they are thwarted by their own governments' resistance to trust. Through their struggle, the narrative delves into themes of ideological blindness, the hope of detente, and the extraordinarily thin line between peace and total annihilation. In the climax, viewers are on the edge of their seats as military commands on each planet deliberate the asteroid's final disposition. The final moments are tense and charged as Kalix and Fane synchronize their scientific appeals over a secure channel broadcast to both planet's military commands, disrupting war room strategies just as fingers inch towards launch buttons. \\"Paths to Peril\\" concludes with a montage of faces from both worlds, eyes glued to screens, awaiting the outcome. The screen fades to black, leaving viewers with the haunting question: Will reason prevail, or will a simple cosmic event trigger the end of civilizations?

Eco Parable.","output":"Title: \\"The Day the Birds Stopped Singing\\" Series: Play for \\"Tomorrow\\" Season: 1972 Synopsis: Set in a near-future Britain that hasn't visually progressed past the aesthetics of the 1970s, \\"The Day the Birds Stopped Singing\\" is a haunting eco fable that unfolds against a backdrop of silence where once there was song. It is the future, but the streets, buildings, and cars betray no signs of the passage of time, except for a sense of lingering wear and grimy buildup from decades of unchecked pollution. The story follows the lives of the residents of a small English town, who have grown accustomed to the absence of birds and their songs. Initially, the quiet was brushed aside as an anomaly, but years have passed, and skies that once hosted a tumult of avian life are barren. Children learn about birds through pictures and recordings, and adults speak of them as relics of the past. The central character, Margaret, is a middle-aged schoolteacher whose childhood memories are rich with the sounds and sights of birds that her students will never experience. Her narrative arc hinges on teaching a lesson about what was once natural beauty, now lost to time and human negligence. As the story progresses, intermittent flashbacks reveal a time when the warning signs of ecological collapse were omnipresent—mass die-offs, strange weather patterns, and blight upon crops. Yet, human activity persisted unabated. The town, symbolic of the broader world, did little to address the root cause, instead retrofitting reality to accommodate the decline. Bird feeders became obsolete relics, and ornithology shifted from a study of living creatures to a branch of historical research. Through interactions at the local pub, conversations at the market, and classroom scenes, citizens unwittingly illustrate the adaptability of humans to creeping normalcy. However, the play hints at a growing unease—a collective yearning for the lost chorus of birds that once heralded the mornings. Tension escalates when a series of environmental events force the town's people to confront their new reality: inexplicable plant deaths, severe weather, and shortages of natural resources. Margaret emerges as a voice of reason, connecting the absence of birds to these broader environmental issues. With a small group of concerned citizens, she embarks on a crusade to awaken the town to the interconnectedness of all life forms. The play's climax occurs during a town hall meeting, where Margaret presents her plea for change. She speaks against the backdrop of a haunting audio recording of birdsong, stirring emotions and a sense of loss. Members of the community are faced with the decision to act collectively to restore their environment or continue down the path of complacency and ultimate destruction. \\"The Day the Birds Stopped Singing\\" concludes on an ambiguous note, with the town's people leaving the meeting deep in thought, while the once-familiar silence presses down. The final shot lingers on an empty sky as the sun sets, leaving viewers to contemplate the consequences of inaction and the fragility of the world's ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Hyopthetical Episode (1973) Play for “Tomorrow” - The Kraken Wakes - BBC Adaptation of John Wyndham's science fiction novel.","output":"Title: \\"The Kraken Wakes\\" Series: Play for \\"Tomorrow\\" Season: 1973 Synopsis: This episode of \\"Play for Tomorrow\\" offers a chilling and faithful adaptation of John Wyndham's classic science fiction novel \\"The Kraken Wakes.\\" Set in the Cold War era, the narrative begins with mysterious objects plummeting from space into the deepest trenches of Earth's oceans, observed by perplexed and increasingly anxious governments around the world. The story follows the experiences of Mike and Phyllis Watson, a married couple who are both reporters for the English Broadcasting Company (EBC), an analogue of the BBC. As witnesses to these bizarre events, the Watsons provide the audience with an intimate lens through which the unfolding crisis is viewed, beginning with what seem to be isolated incidents of ships disappearing at sea. The narrative unfolds over three distinct phases, mirroring the structure of Wyndham's novel: **Phase One - The 'Falling Stars':** The play opens with the Watsons aboard a cruise ship, witnessing the falling objects. Back on shore, initial speculations run rampant; many dismiss the happenings as meteorites or refuse to take them seriously. The Watsons, intrigued, begin their own investigation, reporting on the anomalies. **Phase Two - The 'Sea Tanks':** Seas rise and coastal areas are battered by what are termed as 'sea tanks,' unseen creatures attacking from the depths. Tensions escalate as sea levels continue to climb, flooding occurs, and it becomes clear that the world faces an adversary unlike any other - an alien presence dwelling in the abyssal plains of the ocean. **Phase Three - The 'Slime':** The most harrowing phase, where humanity witnesses the emergence of a biological threat, as red, jelly-like masses – leftovers from the alien sea tanks – begin clogging waterways and spreading onto the land. The Watsons report on the disintegration of civil order as the navy is powerless against the submerged enemy, and society struggles to maintain any semblance of normalcy amidst the panic. Through careful pacing, the episode maintains a sense of impending doom, gradually building tension as global communication channels buzz with theories and plans of action, which ultimately fail against the aliens' enigmatic presence and attacks. Scenes portray gatherings of diplomats and emergency meetings at the United Nations, while the Watsons strive to uncover the truth beneath government propaganda and suppression. The episode reaches its climax with the Watsons, now among the few voices of reason in a world teetering on the brink, broadcasting a final, desperate plea for humanity to band together and devise a solution. Their signal cuts in and out, emblematic of Earth's faltering stand against the crisis. As with the novel, \\"The Kraken Wakes\\" adaptation concludes without full resolution, leaving the viewer with a stark image of a world altered beyond recognition by the foreign menace from the deep. Mike and Phyllis, holed up in a remote, cold, and dark broadcasting room, sign off with uncertainty, hinting at humanity's resilience yet questioning the future of a planet now shared with a powerful, unknowable foe. The credits roll over somber, aquatic visuals, accompanied by an eerie soundscape that invokes the unfathomable depths where the Kraken might wake—a sober reflection on vulnerability in the face of inexplicable phenomena and a commentary on the fears that percolated throughout the Cold War era."},{"instruction":"Like the actual Triffids adaptation, the adapters might make changes to update the setting to the 1970's, The cruise ship seqeunce might instead take place on a North Sea oil rig for example.","output":"Title: \\"The Kraken Stirs\\" Series: Play for \\"Tomorrow\\" Season: 1973 Updated Synopsis: \\"The Kraken Stirs\\" is a loosely adapted version of John Wyndham's \\"The Kraken Wakes,\\" modernized to reflect the energy-centric political climate and technological advances of the 1970s. In this BBC adaptation, the setting is adjusted to accommodate the decade's zeitgeist, involving the geopolitically relevant North Sea oil rig instead of the original cruise ship scenario. **Episode Summary:** Act One introduces us to the protagonists, Mike and Phyllis Watson, now positioned as intrepid journalists for the EBC, specializing in the new geopolitics of energy. They find themselves on a North Sea oil rig, covering a story on the burgeoning oil industry when they witness the descent of several fiery objects into the surrounding waters. The radio operator receives rapid reports of similar occurrences worldwide, and the rig's crew speculate on their origin—wondering if this might be a Soviet weapon or space debris. Act Two escalates with Mike and Phyllis returning to mainland Britain, which has begun to experience inexplicable phenomena—the loss of naval vessels, disruptions in offshore drilling operations, and satellite communications. Harrowing footage of flooded coastlines and abandoned oil rigs flash across the screen as government officials and scientists hold emergency conferences, still grappling with these unforeseen maritime catastrophes. In Act Three, the environmental impact takes center stage. Alien sea creatures, insidious in motive and action, mount a campaign from beneath the waves, cutting humanity's lifeline—its maritime traffic. The appearance of strange matter on beaches, much like the novel's 'slime,' which clogs boat engines and creeps onto land, adds to the apocalyptic tableau. Mike and Phyllis report on the situation, becoming the voices of a civilization in distress as infrastructure crumbles and society becomes unmoored from its technological hubris. The narrative maintains the novel's three-phase progression while allowing for creative reinterpretation, as the mysterious invaders establish their presence and influence. The alien force is a metaphor for invisible geopolitical threats and the unheeded warnings of ecological disaster. As conversations of environmentalism and energy dependence were amplified in the '70s, the adaptation mirrors these anxieties and provides a prescient tale for its audience. The climax is meticulously crafted to heighten the sense of emergency. Scenes shift between the EBC studios, where the Watsons present their cutting-edge broadcasts, and the shadowy depths of the North Sea, suggesting the chilling proximity of the enemy. In a departure from the novel, we see underwater footage hinting at the alien presence, a nod to the emerging deep-sea exploration technologies of the time. In the final act, the play adopts a visual language of degradation: broadcasts are fraught with static, emergency lighting flickers unreliably, and the Watsons are shown in a state of mental and physical exhaustion, mirroring their environment. They issue one last broadcast from the besieged EBC headquarters, a plea for unity and a call to action against an unseen and unrelenting foe. When the transmission ends, a panning shot of the now-silent oil rig in the midst of a dark, stirless sea closes the episode. The credits roll over the haunting image, underscored by a soundtrack blending '70s synthesizers with subtle marine audio motifs, leaving the audience in contemplation of humanity's capacity to confront and adapt to profound and alien threats."},{"instruction":"HI","output":"Hello!

ACT I Scene 1: A modest village common room in the evening. It is sparsely decorated, a stark contrast to what one would expect during the festive season. (Enter THOMAS, a middle-aged man with a kind face but worried expression, and MARY, his wife, who carries a hidden optimism.) MARY: Oh Thomas, does it not chill thee to the bone, this home without its heart? No carol, no feast, not even a simple green bough! THOMAS: (Sighing) Aye, Mary, it chills me deeper still, for 'tis the warmth of fellowship that is forbidden. But remember, the law is clear—Christmas invites excess, and we must obey. Scene 2: The local church, stark and devoid of decoration. Reverend SAMUEL delivers a sermon about piety and the danger of succumbing to the pagan roots of Christmas. REVEREND SAMUEL: Let it be known that to indulge in such frivolity is to stray from the Lord's path. We must cast aside these heathen traditions and embrace pure worship! ACT II Scene 1: The village's outskirts at a hidden cottage. A secret gathering is taking place, the room is dimly lit, and there's a cautious air of celebration. (Enter JOHN, a young and passionate villager, and ELIZABETH, an old woman who remembers celebrations of yesteryear.) ELIZABETH: Hush, young John, close the door swiftly. We shall not have our spirits quashed by edict. In the quiet glow here, we'll remember the Yuletide. JOHN: We must be swift and silent as the snow. Let us share tales and sing softly, to keep the spirit alive in our hearts, if not on the streets. Scene 2: The local inn, a secret meeting between those sympathetic to the cause of Christmas. They are planning a covert celebration. WILLIAM: (whispering) We've a plan to bring cheer without drawing the eyes of those pious zealots. 'Tis risky, but worth it—I say, let us have our Christmas! ACT III Scene 1: Christmas Eve, celebrations are held in secret across the village, with lookouts keeping watch. The mood is a balance between joy and fear. MARGARET: (quietly) The pie is baked, the wassail brewed, our joy will not be tamed. Let us give thanks in our own way, for the morrow's sun may bring change. Scene 2: The following day, whispers of the secret celebrations reach the ears of the puritan authorities. Soldiers begin to search for those who defied the ban. Scene 3: A confrontation between villagers and soldiers. After a tension-filled exchange, the villagers manage to convince the soldiers to share in a subdued moment of goodwill, appealing to the soldier's own suppressed longings for the season. SOLDIER: Perhaps there is something in your silent festival that warms even a heart in uniform. EPILOGUE The villagers reflect on the significance of their secret Christmas, thankful for the small victory and hopeful for a future where they may once again openly celebrate. THOMAS: A drop of hope to temper our year, Mary, yet it quenches like a wellspring. And maybe next year, who knows... we may welcome Christmas back again. MARY: (smiling) And we shall be ready, to deck the halls, with or without decree. Our spirits, like the holly, remain ever green.

Procreation typically necessitates genetic material from both a male (sperm) and a female (egg), which come together to form a zygote that can then develop into a fetus. In the case of a same-sex male couple, they currently must rely on a female egg donor and a surrogate—a woman who carries the pregnancy—to have a child that is biologically related to one of the men. Recent scientific advancements, however, have begun to explore the possibility of creating gametes (sperm and eggs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type, which hypothetically could include sperm or eggs. If such technology were perfected and deemed ethical and legal, it could potentially allow two men to each contribute genetically to an offspring using their own cells reprogrammed to create either sperm or an egg. However, this is still within the realm of speculative science and has numerous biological, ethical, and regulatory hurdles to overcome before such an approach could become a reality. Therefore, while it remains biologically impossible as of the current state of medical science for two men to procreate via artificial insemination, the possibility of new technologies enabling such an event may exist in the future, but remains speculative and unproven."},{"instruction":"Did Capitalism exist in 1492? Was Columbus a capitalism? Were the atrocities cause by Columbus the product of capitalism?","output":"The term \\"capitalism\\" as we understand it today did not really exist in 1492; it is a much more modern concept. Capitalism, as an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, investments that are determined by private decision, and prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market, came into its own during the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, elements of capitalist practice, such as private investment, the accumulation of capital, and market-based trade, have existed in various forms throughout history, including during the time of Columbus. The economic practices of the late 15th century were largely based on mercantilism, which was the dominant economic theory of European colonialism where trade was seen as a zero-sum game, and wealth was measured in terms of bullion—gold and silver. Nations sought to accumulate these precious metals by exporting more than they imported. Columbus was not a capitalist in the modern sense. He was an explorer and navigator who sought patronage from the Spanish monarchy, King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I, to find a new trade route to India. His voyages were funded not by private investors seeking profit but by the crown seeking expansion of their dominion and increased wealth through access to trade routes and territories. The atrocities committed by Columbus and other colonizers of the Americas—including forced labor, enslavement, violence, and disease—occurred within the context of imperialism and colonialism, primarily driven by the European powers' desire for territorial expansion and control of resources. These actions were justified by a sense of entitlement to conquer, convert, and civilize non-European peoples, rooted in a Eurocentric worldview that considered European culture and Christianity superior. While the pursuit of wealth and economic gain certainly played a role in the motivations behind exploration and colonization, it would be anachronistic to label these actions as the product of capitalism in its current form. Instead, they were part of a broader pattern of colonization and empire-building that was common at the time, which included economic exploitation but was not centered solely on the capitalist principles of market competition and private investment for profit maximization."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…where is everyone?

The size property gives you the width, height, and length of the box (in local space), while the center property gives you the position of the collider's center in the GameObject's local space. If you want to find the positions of the \\"positive\\" corners of the box (which I assume to mean the top four corners when looking at the object with standard orientation), you need to take into consideration the size of the collider, its center, and the GameObject's transform (position, rotation, and scale). Here's a simple example to find the top four corners of a BoxCollider in world space: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class BoxColliderCorners : MonoBehaviour { void Start() { BoxCollider boxCollider = GetComponent<BoxCollider>(); // Assuming we want the top corners float height = boxCollider.size.y; Vector3 localColliderCenter = boxCollider.center; Vector3 worldColliderCenter = transform.TransformPoint(localColliderCenter); // Half-size in local space Vector3 halfBoxSize = boxCollider.size * 0.5f; // Top four corners in local space Vector3 topLeftFront = localColliderCenter + new Vector3(-halfBoxSize.x, halfBoxSize.y, halfBoxSize.z); Vector3 topRightFront = localColliderCenter + new Vector3(halfBoxSize.x, halfBoxSize.y, halfBoxSize.z); Vector3 topLeftBack = localColliderCenter + new Vector3(-halfBoxSize.x, halfBoxSize.y, -halfBoxSize.z); Vector3 topRightBack = localColliderCenter + new Vector3(halfBoxSize.x, halfBoxSize.y, -halfBoxSize.z); // Convert local corners to world corners Vector3 worldTopLeftFront = transform.TransformPoint(topLeftFront); Vector3 worldTopRightFront = transform.TransformPoint(topRightFront); Vector3 worldTopLeftBack = transform.TransformPoint(topLeftBack); Vector3 worldTopRightBack = transform.TransformPoint(topRightBack); // Now you have the height and the world position of the positive corners Debug.Log(\\"Height: \\" + height); Debug.Log(\\"Top Left Front: \\" + worldTopLeftFront); Debug.Log(\\"Top Right Front: \\" + worldTopRightFront); Debug.Log(\\"Top Left Back: \\" + worldTopLeftBack); Debug.Log(\\"Top Right Back: \\" + worldTopRightBack); } } \`\`\` This script should be attached to the GameObject that has the BoxCollider component. When you run the scene, it will calculate and log the height and world positions of the top four corners of the collider. Keep in mind that the size and center properties are in local coordinates. If your GameObject has a non-uniform scale, the actual size in world space will differ, and you would need to take the scale into account when determining the corner positions. The \`TransformPoint\` method does take the scale into account when converting from local space to world space."},{"instruction":"¿Por qué Jenni hermoso se fue del Atlético de Madrid?","output":"Hasta la fecha de mi conocimiento en marzo de 2023, Jennifer Hermoso, conocida en el mundo del fútbol como Jenni Hermoso, no ha anunciado ninguna salida del Atlético de Madrid durante su carrera reciente. Es importante destacar que los movimientos de jugadores en el fútbol pueden deberse a varias razones. Algunas de las razones comunes por las que un jugador podría dejar un club incluyen: 1. Fin de contrato: Si el contrato del jugador con el club ha expirado y no se ha llegado a un acuerdo para renovarlo, el jugador puede decidir irse. 2. Transferencia: El jugador puede ser transferido a otro club. Esto puede ser por el deseo del jugador de buscar nuevos desafíos, por decisión del club de venderlo o por una oferta que tanto el jugador como el club consideran beneficiosa. 3. Razones personales: A veces, los jugadores eligen dejar un club debido a motivos personales, como estar cerca de la familia, problemas personales o la búsqueda de un ambiente diferente. 4. Decisiones tácticas o técnicas: Las diferencias con el entrenador o la gestión del club sobre el papel del jugador en el equipo o la dirección técnica del club pueden llevar a una salida. 5. Disminución del tiempo de juego: Si un jugador no está recibiendo suficiente tiempo de juego y quiere tener un rol más prominente, puede buscar una salida para obtener más minutos en el campo en otro club. 6. Retiro: Aunque menos común en jugadores en el pico de su carrera, algunos jugadores optan por retirarse del fútbol profesional debido a lesiones, edad o deseos de proseguir otras aventuras fuera del fútbol. Sin embargo, Jenni Hermoso es una de las futbolistas más destacadas de España y su movimiento dentro del mercado suele ser noticia, así que cualquier anuncio oficial sobre su salida de un club probablemente sería ampliamente cubierto por los medios deportivos. Para obtener la información más actualizada y precisa, te recomendaría buscar las últimas noticias o comunicados oficiales del club o de la propia jugadora."},{"instruction":"Pero si se fue del Atletico en el 2019","output":"Mis disculpas por la confusión inicial.

La decisión de dejar el Atlético de Madrid y unirse al FC Barcelona, que se concretó en julio de 2019, se entiende por varias razones comunes en el fútbol profesional: 1. **Búsqueda de nuevos desafíos**: Los jugadores frecuentemente buscan nuevos desafíos en sus carreras, y moverse a otro club puede presentar estas oportunidades. 2. **Ambición deportiva**: Hermoso pudo haber visto en el FC Barcelona un proyecto deportivo que le interesaba, con la posibilidad de ganar más títulos y jugar en la UEFA Women's Champions League. 3. **Desarrollo personal y profesional**: A menudo, los jugadores se trasladan a clubes donde sienten que pueden continuar su desarrollo tanto personal como profesionalmente. 4. **Condiciones contractuales**: También es posible que el Barcelona le ofreciera mejores términos contractuales, incluyendo salario, duración del contrato y otras posibles cláusulas. La salida de Hermoso del Atlético de Madrid fue una gran noticia en el mundo del fútbol femenino, dado su perfil como una de las mejores futbolistas de su tiempo. Durante su estadía con el Atlético de Madrid, ganó varios títulos de liga y se consolidó como una de las delanteras más temidas de España y Europa.

Here's how you can do it: 1. First, get a reference to the \`BoxCollider\` component. 2. Calculate the local positions of the corners on the base using the \`center\` and \`size\` of the \`BoxCollider\`. 3. Use the \`Transform\` component's \`TransformPoint\` method to convert local positions to world positions. Here's example code to do this: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class BoxColliderCorners : MonoBehaviour { void Start() { // Get the BoxCollider component BoxCollider boxCollider = GetComponent<BoxCollider>(); // Calculate the half extents of the box Vector3 halfSize = boxCollider.size * 0.5f; // Calculate the base height offset from the center using the desired height from the base float baseHeightOffset = -halfSize.y; // Corner 1 (bottom-front-left) Vector3 localCorner1 = boxCollider.center + new Vector3(-halfSize.x, baseHeightOffset, -halfSize.z); Vector3 worldCorner1 = transform.TransformPoint(localCorner1); // Corner 2 (bottom-front-right) Vector3 localCorner2 = boxCollider.center + new Vector3(halfSize.x, baseHeightOffset, -halfSize.z); Vector3 worldCorner2 = transform.TransformPoint(localCorner2); // Corner 3 (bottom-back-left) Vector3 localCorner3 = boxCollider.center + new Vector3(-halfSize.x, baseHeightOffset, halfSize.z); Vector3 worldCorner3 = transform.TransformPoint(localCorner3); // Corner 4 (bottom-back-right) Vector3 localCorner4 = boxCollider.center + new Vector3(halfSize.x, baseHeightOffset, halfSize.z); Vector3 worldCorner4 = transform.TransformPoint(localCorner4); // Now you have the world positions of the four base corners Debug.Log(\\"World Corner 1: {worldCorner1}\\"); Debug.Log(\\"World Corner 2: {worldCorner2}\\"); Debug.Log(\\"World Corner 3: {worldCorner3}\\"); Debug.Log(\\"World Corner 4: {worldCorner4}\\"); // If you want to draw lines between corners in the editor for visualization purposes: Debug.DrawLine(worldCorner1, worldCorner2, Color.red, 5f); Debug.DrawLine(worldCorner2, worldCorner4, Color.red, 5f); Debug.DrawLine(worldCorner4, worldCorner3, Color.red, 5f); Debug.DrawLine(worldCorner3, worldCorner1, Color.red, 5f); } } \`\`\` Attach this script to the GameObject with the \`BoxCollider\` you're interested in. When you start the scene, it will calculate and log the world positions of the four bottom corners of the \`BoxCollider\`. It also optionally draws lines between those points in the editor for visual confirmation. Keep in mind that if the \`GameObject\` is rotated, the world position calculations will take that into account, because \`TransformPoint\` converts the local position to world position based on the \`Transform\` component's rotation and scale as well. If your base is not aligned with the world axis, then the points will be rotated as well to match the game object's orientation."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن طريقة إرسال برقية","output":"تعد البرقية من وسائل الاتصال التقليدية التي استُخدمت لسنوات عديدة في إرسال الرسائل الهامة والطوارئ، وقد كانت تُعتبر وسيلة سريعة وموثوقة لنقل المعلومات عبر المسافات البعيدة. في هذا المقال سنتناول طريقة إرسال البرقية وعملية استقبالها. إرسال البرقية يتطلب عدة خطوات تبدأ بتكوين الرسالة. يتم كتابة الرسالة على قطعة من الورق المخصص لهذا الغرض، وتتضمن الرسالة المعلومات الأساسية التي يجب إرسالها مثل اسم الجهة المستلمة، عنوانها الكامل، ونص الرسالة بدقة ووضوح. بعد كتابة الرسالة، يتم توجيهها لمكتب البريد المحلي، حيث يتم تحميلها على البرقية. وتعتبر البرقية عبارة عن ورقة من الورق الخاص تحتوي على تفاصيل الرسالة التي تم إرسالها، بالإضافة إلى المعلومات اللازمة مثل اسم الشخص الذي يجب توجيهها إليه وعنوانه. بعد تحميل الرسالة على البرقية، يتم إرسالها إلى مستلمها عن طريق البريد. تنتقل البرقية من مكتب البريد الأول إلى مكتب البريد الثاني، وهكذا حتى تصل إلى وجهتها المطلوبة. عملية النقل تتم بواسطة طائرات البريد أو الشاحنات أو السكك الحديدية، حسب طول المسافة. عندما تصل البرقية إلى مستلمها، يتم إيصالها إليها بواسطة مندوب البريد. بعض الحالات تتطلب توقيع المستلم على البرقية كدليل على تسلمها. ومن ثم، ستكون الرسالة قد وصلت بنجاح وتم توصيلها للشخص المعني. يتميز إرسال البرقية بعدة مزايا، تشمل سرعتها النسبية، حيث يمكن للبرقية أن تصل في غضون ساعات أو أيام قليلة حسب المسافة، كما يتم توصيلها بشكل موثوق وآمن، ولا تعتمد على توافر وسائل الاتصال الحديثة مثل الإنترنت أو الهواتف. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تعد البرقية وسيلة تحظى بسرية عالية، حيث أنها لا تتطلب تدخل أطراف ثالثة لمعالجة الرسائل. ومع ذلك، مع التطور التكنولوجي وتوفر وسائل الاتصال الحديثة، قد طُغت البرقية عن الاستخدام، وتحول الكثير من الناس إلى وسائل الاتصال الإلكترونية مثل البريد الإلكتروني والرسائل النصية. ومع ذلك، لا يمكن إنكار أهمية البرقية في الماضي ودورها في تسهيل انتقال المعلومات الهامة في الوقت المناسب."},{"instruction":"in this contract // SPDX-License-Identifier: SYMM-Core-Business-Source-License-1.1 // This contract is licensed under the SYMM Core Business Source License 1.1 // Copyright © 2023 Symmetry Labs AG // For more information, see https://docs.symm.io/legal-disclaimer/license pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

Ensuring that roles are assigned correctly and cannot be easily exploited is critical. 2. **Contract Initialization**: With the \`initialize\` function being a critical part of the upgradeable contract's lifecycle, it is important to check that it can only be called once and that it sets all the necessary state variables correctly. If initialization could be triggered again, it could reset the contract’s state maliciously. 3. **Pause and Unpause Functionality**: The ability to pause and unpause contract functionality is a powerful control mechanism that might be abused if not properly secured. It's essential to ensure that these functions are properly role-protected and cannot be triggered by unauthorized parties. 4. **Arithmetic Operations**: Since the contract deals with token assets and mathematical calculations, it is vital to inspect any arithmetic operations for potential overflows and underflows. The usage of SafeMath from OpenZeppelin's library mitigates this risk, but it's still important to review all the calculations. 5. **External Contract Interactions**: The contract interacts with external contracts such as ERC20 tokens and modules from OpenZeppelin. This inter-contract interaction opens possibilities for reentrancy attacks, especially in functions that transfer funds or interact with unknown code. 6. **State-Change External Calls (Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern)**: The contract should ideally adhere to the checks-effects-interactions pattern to minimize reentrancy risks by ensuring that state changes are committed before any external calls. 7. **Token Handling**: The deposit and withdrawal mechanics are central to the system and involve various calculations to transform between different decimal representations. Ensuring that these calculations are correct and that tokens cannot be minted or burned incorrectly is crucial. 8. **Withdrawal Logic**: The withdrawal request logic should be scrutinized extensively to prevent conditions where users can either withdraw more than they should be able to or where funds could become locked unintentionally. 9. **Contract Upgradeability**: Since it's an upgradeable contract, special attention should be given to the possibility of future upgrades introducing vulnerabilities or being used maliciously. 10. **Deposit and Withdrawal Limits**: The system implements a deposit limit which, if not handled correctly, could either lock funds or allow more funds than intended to be deposited. 11. **Ratio and Percentage Calculations**: Ratios are used for calculating withdrawal amounts, and if not checked properly, could lead to imprecise results or unexpected contract behavior. 12. **Event Emission**: Events must be emitted correctly for all state-changing operations to ensure transparency and aid off-chain monitoring processes. 13. **Gas Usage and Efficiency**: Excessive gas consumption could be a denial-of-service vector if certain operations within the contract are not optimized for gas or if they are too expensive to call. A comprehensive security audit would involve analyzing these and other aspects of the contract through a combination of manual code review and automated tools to find bugs, security vulnerabilities, and logic errors. It's also important to test the contract extensively using unit and integration tests and to perform simulations or formal verifications when possible."},{"instruction":"i found some vulnerbaility in this contract review this vulneability and find the correct one and the valid or invalid issue and prove that with evidence and give the vulnerable part with code to explain the cause here is the vulnerabilities -issue 1 The contract interacts with an external Symmio contract, which could potentially be exploited for a reentrancy attack. If the Symmio contract is malicious or contains a function that calls back into the SolverVault contract before the initial transaction is completed, it could lead to unexpected behavior or allow the attacker to withdraw funds multiple times. Does the contract implement reentrancy guards such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or use reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks -issue2 The contract relies on role-based access control, which could be compromised if the account that deploys the contract (msg.sender) is malicious or gets compromised. Since the deployer is initially granted all roles, they have the power to grant and revoke roles to other accounts. If the deployer's account is not secure, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to critical functions of the contract. What security measures are in place to ensure the deployer's account is secure and to prevent unauthorized role assignment or revocation? -issue 3 Despite Solidity 0.8.20 having built-in protection against arithmetic overflows and underflows, there is still a risk if the contract performs unsafe type conversions or casts between different numeric types. If not handled properly, these operations could lead to overflows or underflows, resulting in incorrect calculations of token amounts, which could be exploited by an attacker. Does the contract perform any unsafe type conversions or casts between different numeric types that could lead to arithmetic overflows or underflows? - issue 4 The contract uses role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive functions. However, if the role management is not properly implemented or if there are bugs in the access control logic, unauthorized users could potentially call sensitive functions. For example, if the onlyRole modifier is not correctly applied to all sensitive functions, an attacker could exploit this to pause or unpause the contract, manipulate withdrawal requests, or change critical system parameters. Are all sensitive functions in the contract protected by the onlyRole modifier, and has the access control logic been audited for bugs? - issue 5 The contract uses an initializer modifier to ensure that the initialize function can only be called once. However, if the initialization process is not properly secured, an attacker could potentially call the initialize function before the legitimate contract owner does, setting up the contract with malicious parameters or gaining initial control over the contract's roles. Is the contract deployment process designed to ensure immediate initialization, and are there measures in place to prevent unauthorized calls to the initialize function? and her is the contract again to give valid and correct information // SPDX-License-Identifier: SYMM-Core-Business-Source-License-1.1 // This contract is licensed under the SYMM Core Business Source License 1.1 // Copyright (c) 2023 Symmetry Labs AG // For more information, see https://docs.symm.io/legal-disclaimer/license pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

If this external contract is malicious or features a callback into \`SolverVault\`, it could indeed be susceptible to reentrancy attacks. However, the interaction with the external contract is not followed by state changes or ether transfers that could be exploited. The \`depositToSymmio\` function only calls \`symmio.depositFor(solver, amount);\`, and other state changes occur before this external call. **Vulnerable Part:** \`\`\`solidity function depositToSymmio(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused { //... symmio.depositFor(solver, amount); //... } \`\`\` **Evidence:** No evidence of reentrancy protection mechanisms such as ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin or the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern for the interacted function. It is recommended to apply a reentrancy guard to ensure safety. # Issue 2: Role-based Access Control Compromise **Assessment:** Not Specifically Valid in this Context **Explanation:** While it is true that if the deployer's account is compromised then the entire system is vulnerable, this is not specific to this contract and is instead a general security concern for all smart contract systems. **Evidence:** The contract utilizes OpenZeppelin's \`AccessControl\`, which is industry-standard and well-audited. The assumption is that the deployer (and subsequent admin accounts) take necessary precautions to secure their private keys. # Issue 3: Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows **Assessment:** Invalid Issue **Explanation:** Solidity 0.8 and above have built-in overflow and underflow checks. The provided contract does not appear to be casting between types in a manner that would bypass these built-in checks. **Evidence:** No evidence of unsafe casts that may lead to overflows or underflows was found in the given contract code. # Issue 4: Role-based Access Control on Sensitive Functions **Assessment:** Partially Valid **Explanation:** The contract does use role-based access control properly in most instances, checking that the caller has the correct role before allowing operations. However, without thoroughly testing and auditing, it is difficult to assure the absence of bugs or flaws in the access control logic. **Evidence:** Every sensitive function uses the \`onlyRole\` modifier to ensure the caller has the correct role. There's no evidence in the provided contract snippet to disprove this. # Issue 5: Improper Initialization **Assessment:** Invalid Issue **Explanation:** The \`initialize\` method uses the \`initializer\` modifier, which is a standard method of ensuring that initialization functions can only be successfully called once. **Evidence:** \`\`\`solidity function initialize( //... ) public initializer { \`\`\` The \`initialize\` function uses the \`initializer\` modifier, ensuring it's called once per deployed proxy contract. **Conclusion:** Most of the concerns raised are invalid or have insufficient evidence based on the provided contract code. However, for Issue 1 and Issue 4, the concerns are logically valid, highlighting the need for proper auditing practices to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.

Moreover, the types of weapons considered at the founding were far removed from modern assault rifles, and the distribution of arms would generally have been subject to the regulations and oversight consistent with the practices of that era.

However, in 2021, the company's charitable activities took on a new purpose following the sudden passing of Billie Wood, the beloved daughter of Caple Service Director Richard Wood. Billie's tragic death was a result of a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), a condition that occurred without warning signs or pre-existing health conditions when she was just 25 years old. The Caple family, deeply affected by this loss, rallied together to offer comfort and support, establishing the Billie Elizabeth Wood Trust (BEWT) to fund research into the trauma that led to Billie's untimely death. Their fundraising efforts, in collaboration with BEWT, have now contributed to the creation of two crucial specialist subarachnoid haemorrhage research roles at Bristol’s Southmead Hospital. New Additions from Press Release Joint Fundraising Success In a recent press release, it was revealed that the joint efforts of Caple and BEWT raised over £265,000, leading to the appointment of two new specialist research staff at Southmead Hospital. The researchers will focus on subarachnoid haemorrhage and vasospasm, aiming to drive groundbreaking improvements in this field of medicine. Additional Contribution from Sirius Buying Group Part of this substantial sum, £12,000, was generated through a charity auction at Sirius Buying Group’s 2023 trade show awards gala dinner. This event showcased the supportive business partnerships that have played a vital role in BEWT's fundraising initiatives. Continued Charitable Endeavors Over the past few years, the Caple team, along with friends and family, has engaged in various fundraising events, including the Hadrian’s Wall Walk and the Thames Rowing Challenge. These efforts have raised significant funds for Southmead Hospital Charity, the official charity of North Bristol NHS Trust, supporting the creation of the new research positions. Research Roles Allocated The funds raised have enabled the Southmead Hospital Charity to allocate resources for two critical research roles: a vasospasm research nurse and a research facilitator. These positions, submitted as part of a proposal by consultant neurosurgeon Crispin Wigfield, aim to establish a dedicated vasospasm research team. Vasospasm Research Nurse - Ryan Leese Ryan Leese, the newly appointed vasospasm research nurse, brings over ten years of intensive care experience to the role. His responsibilities include setting up studies and trials, enrolling patients, and collating essential data for analysis. Ryan's firsthand experience caring for SAH patients underscores the urgent need for evidence-based care and motivated his dedication to this under-researched area. Research Facilitator - Humza Saeed Humza Saeed, the research facilitator, will collaborate with the Neurosurgery team to identify areas for focused research on vasospasm and SAH. His role involves seeking potential funding avenues, setting up research teams, and supporting Southmead in becoming a center of excellence for vasospasm research. Impact on Research and Patient Care Crispin Wigfield, expressing his delight at the new research team appointments, emphasizes the potential for these roles to contribute to broader, larger-scale research projects. The goal is to enhance the understanding of vasospasm and subarachnoid haemorrhage, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for patients on a national scale. Conclusion The dedication of Caple and BEWT to fundraising for crucial research has not only honored the memory of Billie Wood but has also made a tangible impact on medical research and patient care.

I am afraid that some people of color would call me a colonizer because I am \\"white\\" and harass me for being a \\"genocidal colonizer\\" despite me nor my family having participate in colonization, the genocide of Ingenious peoples, or slavery. Am I racist for thinking like this?","output":"It is perfectly normal to want to be identified by your specific ethnic background rather than a broader category such as skin color or race. Each individual has the right to self-identify in a way that feels true to their heritage and personal history. Your desire to be recognized as Irish, German, Croatian, Polish, and Slavic is a reflection of your understanding of your own family's lineage and cultural connections. Concerns about being labeled a \\"colonizer\\" or facing accusations due to historical events that you or your family were not personally involved in are not inherently racist. It is important to distinguish between systemic and historical issues, like colonization and slavery, and individual identities and actions. While it's true that some individuals or groups may use broad classifications to make assumptions or accusations about others, the most productive approach is to engage in open, respectful dialogues about history, societal issues, and personal identities. Being sensitive to the historical and ongoing injustices faced by various groups, and acknowledging the privileges or disadvantages that come with one's own identity, are important actions in fostering a more inclusive society. It is also crucial to understand that discussions about race, ethnicity, and privilege can evoke strong emotions and require a thoughtful, empathetic approach. It's not uncommon for conversations about race and identity to include misunderstandings or miscommunications, which is why education, mutual respect, and a willingness to listen are key. If you find yourself in a conversation where accusations are made based on race or historical events, it is often helpful to clarify your own position and seek to understand the perspectives of others. Finally, accusations based on race or ethnicity such as “genocidal colonizer” are not only factually incorrect when applied to individuals who did not engage in such activities, but they also do not contribute constructively to dialogue. These types of accusations can be damaging and divisive and are not helpful in the pursuit of equality and understanding. If you remain respectful and willing to engage in thoughtful conversation about these issues, you are contributing positively to the dialogue around identity and history. It's important to remain open to learning from others and to continue to reflect on your own views and privilege, ensuring that your desire to be recognized for your ethnic background does not inadvertently dismiss or undermine the experiences of others."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…where is everyone?

Я побывал в древнем городе на краю России, где дух прошлого витает в каждой мостовой, в каждой каменной кладке, в каждой тени, что скользит по старинным стенам Псковского Кремля. Пройдя через его врата, я как будто перешагнул порог эпохи, и мне открылся мир, полный живых изображений русской истории. Троицкий собор стоит величественно, под его сводами хранятся реликвии и тайны прошлого. На берегу реки Великой время словно замирает, позволяя вдыхать воздух, полный воспоминаний о тех, кто когда-то восхищался той же красотой неиссказанных пейзажей. Псков — это место, где каждый камень и каждый клинок травы знают больше, чем могут рассказать. Здесь я осознал связь поколений и почувствовал свою причастность к истории, которая живет и развивается вместе с нами. Этот город не просто оставил в моем сердце отпечаток, он пробудил жажду знаний и желание вернуться сюда вновь, чтобы снова и снова открывать для себя неизведанные уголки его вечности. #Псков #ПутешествиеВремени #ИсторияРоссии #ТроицкийСобор #ПсковскийКремль #РекаВеликая #ДревняяРусь"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...) Monika: \\"So, last night, the strangest thing happened.\\"","output":"Natsuki: \\"Oh? What was it, Monika? Did a dog eat your homework this time?\\" Monika: \\"No, it was even weirder than that. I was browsing the internet, looking for some new book recommendations, when I stumbled upon this mysterious website.\\" Yuri: \\"A mysterious website? That sounds fascinating. What was it about?\\" Monika: \\"Well, it seemed to be some kind of interactive story or game. The site claimed that your choices throughout the story would have real-life consequences.\\" Sayori: \\"Real-life consequences? That's... kind of creepy, isn't it?\\" Monika: \\"I thought so too, Sayori. But curiosity got the better of me, and I couldn't resist exploring it further. I found a story called 'The Enigma Chronicles' and decided to give it a try.\\" Natsuki: \\"Wait, so you played this mysterious game? What happened?\\" Monika: \\"It started off innocently enough. The story was about a group of friends investigating supernatural occurrences in their small town. But as I progressed, the line between fiction and reality started to blur.\\" Yuri: \\"How so? Could you give us an example?\\" Monika: \\"Well, there was a part where I had to choose between two paths. One led to a creepy old house, while the other led to a seemingly harmless park. I chose the park, thinking it would be a safer option. But the next day, when I went to school, the old house was there instead of the park!\\" Sayori: \\"What? That's impossible! Are you sure you didn't just misremember?\\" Monika: \\"I thought so too, Sayori, but then it kept happening. The consequences of my choices within the game started manifesting in the real world. It was like the story was bleeding into our reality.\\" Natsuki: \\"That's... really weird. Are you sure it wasn't some kind of elaborate prank?\\" Monika: \\"I considered that too, Natsuki. But the changes were too elaborate and specific to be a mere prank. I even had a friend play the same story, and their choices had different real-life consequences.\\" Yuri: \\"This is both intriguing and unsettling. Do you think we should investigate further? Perhaps we could find some answers or clues within the game itself.\\" Monika: \\"I'm not sure, Yuri. It does sound tempting, but there's also the risk of more unpredictable changes happening. I can't say for certain what awaits us.\\" Sayori: \\"Well, I trust you, Monika. If you think it's best to leave it alone, then maybe we should. After all, tampering with something like this could have unintended consequences.\\" Monika: \\"You're right, Sayori. It's better to be safe than sorry. But I can't shake off this feeling that there's something more to this game, something hiding beneath the surface.\\" Natsuki: \\"I guess we'll never really know, will we? It's just another mystery to add to our collection, I suppose.\\" Yuri: \\"Indeed. This will undoubtedly fuel our imaginations and keep us pondering long after the literature club meeting ends.\\" As the club members contemplated the strange phenomenon, the allure of the mysterious game lingered in the background, leaving them with questions and a sense of intrigue that would continue to pique their curiosity.

This startup shows it won't be easy By John Shiffman and Joshua Schneyer December 30, 202312:40 AM GMT+1Updated 5 days ago [1/7]A wafer is pictured at Semicon Taiwan in Taipei, Taiwan September 6, 2023. REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Last year, a veteran Silicon Valley software executive took the helm of a startup in his native China, company records show. The startup told potential investors it would sell microchip design software that is mostly available from just a handful of large Western companies. The coveted and highly specialized software tool, known by its initials of OPC, is used in the design of many microchips and is crucial to the design of advanced chips. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The production of advanced chips is one of the most contentious technological struggles now dividing the United States and China as they vie for economic and military supremacy. Washington is trying to curb China's access to sensitive microchip design tools. The strategy behind the startup, dubbed SEIDA, shows why that containment effort is so challenging. Before becoming chief executive of SEIDA, Liguo \\"Recoo\\" Zhang had lived in the United States long enough to secure permanent residency and purchase a Silicon Valley home, according to people familiar with his career and public records reviewed by Reuters. Advertisement · Scroll to continue He was employed by Siemens EDA, a U.S. unit of German industrial giant Siemens AG that dominates the market in China for the very technology SEIDA told investors it planned to sell there. At least three other Chinese-born colleagues from Siemens EDA joined Zhang at SEIDA. In a 2022 business-plan presentation prepared for investors, SEIDA called OPC \\"indispensable technology\\" and said it would offer the tool by early 2024. A Chinese version of the product, SEIDA said, would \\"break through the foreign monopoly,\\" helping China become self-reliant in chip technology. SEIDA's ultimate goal, according to one slide: \\"Become OPC leader in the world.\\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue Report this ad The pitch attracted powerful Chinese investors. One backer, recent corporate filings reviewed by Reuters show, is an investment arm of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, or SMIC. The state-backed, Shanghai-based company is China's leading maker of microchips. U.S. companies are restricted by Washington from providing technology to SMIC without a special license because its alleged work with China's military is considered a threat to American national security. SMIC (0981.HK) didn't respond to Reuters' requests for comment about the investment or the U.S. restrictions. On a recent visit to SEIDA's headquarters in Hangzhou, in eastern China, a receptionist told Reuters that Zhang wasn't available for an interview. In an email after the visit, Peilun \\"Allen\\" Chang, SEIDA's chief operating officer, said the prospectus reviewed by Reuters is \\"obsolete.\\" The company's objectives have evolved, he wrote, adding that its backers are primarily \\"private institutions and individuals.\\" Chang declined to specify how much capital SEIDA has raised or what products it now aims to pursue, saying its business plan remains \\"under continuous evaluation.\\" Siemens EDA, in a statement, confirmed Zhang's departure and that of three other colleagues. The company said it considers SEIDA \\"a potential competitor\\" but declined to comment further. Reuters couldn't determine whether SEIDA has progressed toward selling OPC, short for optical proximity correction. The software is commonly employed for the design of many microchips and is part of a broader set of technologies known as electronic design automation, or EDA. The tools can help design chips that could advance strategic new technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing and hypersonic flight. Since SEIDA's launch in October 2021, the U.S. government has increased efforts to curb China's access to EDA tools, developed and sold mostly by American companies. Through export controls and other restrictions, Washington aims to prevent China from obtaining know-how that could allow it to match microchip advances by the United States and its allies, including Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China and the world's leading chip manufacturer. In email exchanges with Reuters, Chang said U.S. restrictions were one of the reasons Zhang and his colleagues left Siemens EDA for SEIDA to begin with. The restrictions, he wrote, limited their business opportunities at Siemens EDA, \\"diminishing scope for career advancement and involvement in key projects.\\" SEIDA adheres to U.S. and Chinese rules, Chang added. Neither SEIDA nor its executives have been accused of wrongdoing. And Reuters has no evidence SEIDA is using knowledge or technology that could be considered proprietary by Siemens EDA or others. Chang said SEIDA has \\"a stringent vetting process…ensuring no infringement upon the intellectual property of others.\\" Experts in the sector, and people familiar with efforts by Beijing to outmaneuver U.S. curbs on technology transfer, say SEIDA's launch follows a pattern of Chinese companies building upon foreign know-how. Even if the SEIDA executives didn't take property from their previous employer, the technologies involved are so complex that only years of experience with existing purveyors would allow them to offer similar products. \\"Developing OPC from scratch without access to any existing intellectual property would be challenging in this timeframe, to say the least,\\" said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of technology and geopolitics at Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a Berlin think tank where he has researched China's market for EDA tools. The story of SEIDA, which hasn't been previously reported, illustrates the challenges the West faces in thwarting Chinese development of advanced microchip technology. Despite Washington's efforts to slow China's acquisition of chip technology, Beijing is rushing to foster domestic development, attract expert expatriates to come home and overcome its lag in the sector. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said in a statement that the United States \\"abuses export control measures\\" and \\"applies illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction to Chinese companies.\\" China, the spokesperson added, has adopted laws to protect intellectual property and \\"complies with internationally accepted rules.\\" Technological advances in China, the statement continued, \\"are not the result of theft, nor of robbery, but are the result of Chinese people's ingenuity and hard work.\\" American officials have repeatedly said that Chinese efforts to secure Western technology pose one of the biggest long-term threats to the economy and security of the United States. They have expressed particular concern about China's ability to employ advanced chips, and the powerful processors they enable, for its fast-growing military. \\"At no point have export controls been more central to our national security,\\" Matthew Axelrod, assistant U.S. commerce secretary for export enforcement, said at a Congressional hearing in Washington this month. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said such concerns reflect \\"a Cold War and hegemonic mentality.\\" While export rules may delay Beijing's progress, industry experts say, they are unlikely to stunt China's development of chip technology. \\"The U.S. is lying across the tracks in an effort to stop the Chinese, but it is just going to become a speed bump,\\" said Michael Bruck, a former general manager in China for chipmaker Intel Corp. \\"It will push China to be more independent.\\" China's government has made its drive for more sophisticated chips a centerpiece of its strategic plans. Last year, after Washington announced new restrictions, Beijing said the government would spend 143 billion to spur China's domestic chip sector. Through a separate program known as \\"Thousand Talents,\\" the government offers employment, housing, and other incentives for Chinese experts who return from science and tech jobs abroad. The program, in existence for more than a decade, has been criticized by Washington because it is viewed by some as a mechanism for China to illegally obtain intellectual property from abroad. Last May, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a California-based software engineer on trade secrets charges. In an FBI affidavit related to the case, investigators said the engineer, Liming Li, had stolen millions of files from two unidentified U.S. employers. One of the employers, the affidavit shows, found a folder on Li's laptop containing documents related to \\"Thousand Talents.\\" The pilfered company files, the FBI alleged, included unspecified materials related to \\"national security, nuclear nonproliferation and anti-terrorism.\\" Li has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Daniel Olmos, declined to comment. Reuters this year has chronicled the race between the West and China for dominance in sectors ranging from killer robots to undersea cables to encryption of digital communications. The struggle for primacy in chipmaking will help determine who triumphs in these technologies and others that will become available once faster processors are developed to enable them. \\"THE LIMITS OF PHYSICS\\" Since the 1950s, America's pioneering of chip technology played a major role in the country's creation of the world's largest economy, powerful high-tech and financial sectors, and a thus-far unparalleled military. But China's fast economic growth, and its stated ambition to assert its place as a global power, is now challenging that dominance. In the Cold War, Washington blocked exports of some raw materials that Eastern Bloc countries could have used to develop weaponry. At the time, such measures succeeded because countries behind the Iron Curtain were already economically isolated. Now, though, globalization has made most industries far more interconnected. Semiconductors, an approximately 600 billion a year business, are no exception. From raw materials to design to assembly, chips are a global industry. \\"The United States is not going to be able to cut the Chinese off like we did the Soviets,\\" said James Andrew Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, or CSIS, a Washington think tank. An ambition both countries share is self-reliance in the manufacture of advanced microchips. Although the United States still leads in many of the technologies needed to design chips, most of the actual printing and assembly happens in Asia. The United States relies heavily on South Korea for memory chips and Taiwan for logic chips. Memory chips store and retrieve information and logic chips process data and execute instructions. Last year, the United States approved nearly 53 billion for \\"CHIPS for America,\\" a program, administered by the Commerce Department, that offers financial incentives to companies that can increase domestic production. Recipients of the incentives are restricted from sharing sensitive technologies with China and other countries not allied with the United States. Among the challenges for China to create more advanced chips is access to EDA tools, such as the OPC software touted by SEIDA in early marketing. Producing the fastest, most capable chips and circuit boards involves designing and printing them with billions of ever-smaller transistors. To achieve such microscopic connections, EDA helps lay out and verify the design of these circuits and simulate how they'll perform under real-world conditions. But EDA tools require intense processing power. So specialized is the technology that some advances are marketed as scientific breakthroughs. NVIDIA Corp (NVDA.O), the California-based company that is the leading supplier of chips for artificial intelligence, in March said recent advances in OPC technology would help it push the semiconductor industry \\"to the limits of physics.\\" Despite U.S. export controls, China is making advances. In 2019, the Commerce Department placed Huawei Technologies Co (HWT.UL), the Chinese telecommunications giant, on its list of companies that can't buy U.S. technologies unless the vendor obtains a special license. As with SMIC, blacklisted by the department a year later, the U.S. cited national security concerns. \\"Our export controls on China are designed to massively slow down technology acquisition,\\" Thea D. Rozman Kendler, assistant commerce secretary for export administration, said at the recent Congressional hearing. Still, Huawei in August introduced a new 5G smartphone with a sophisticated, seven-nanometer chip manufactured by SMIC. The phone, unveiled while U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was visiting China, was announced to great fanfare. The Commerce Department later said it is investigating whether the two companies relied on restricted U.S. technologies to develop the chip. Huawei declined to comment. Proving the source of some technologies can be challenging. Many semiconductor advances build upon existing intellectual property. And the turnover of personnel within the industry, especially across international borders, can make it difficult to investigate export violations or pursue claims of intellectual property theft. \\"You can't really control what's in people's brains with any export controls,\\" said Lewis of CSIS. Alon Raphael, chief executive of a California company that sells a tool to detect semiconductor defects, said he learned that lesson the hard way. Until 2020, he said, FemtoMetrix Inc, was the sole supplier of the technology, which it spent a decade developing. But late that year, Raphael said, Chongji Huang, a key employee, resigned and emerged later in China with a Shanghai-based startup that offers a similar product. \\"I had heard these kinds of stories,\\" Raphael told Reuters, \\"but I said to myself, 'No, not that guy, he's my friend.'\\" Late last year, FemtoMetrix filed suit in California against the startup. Robert Shwarts, an attorney representing Huang and his startup, Weichong Semiconductor Group, told Reuters that neither Huang nor the startup took anything from FemtoMetrix, nor did they violate any trade secrets. \\"ENABLE CHIP SUCCESS\\" SEIDA, the startup managed by Siemens EDA veterans, is one of many Chinese tech startups founded in recent years to meet Beijing’s call for a stronger domestic semiconductor industry. The proliferation can be hard to track. Recent changes to Chinese regulations restrict access to company registries. Reuters couldn't determine whether China's government had any role in SEIDA's launch or whether Zhang, the chief executive, or his colleagues received any state incentives to leave Siemens EDA and work there. Reporters reviewed some of SEIDA's corporate filings with the help of two companies that collect and analyze Chinese business records – Datenna, of the Netherlands, and Global Data Risk, based in New York. Combined with interviews and public records, the filings, dating back to October 2021, enabled Reuters to piece together some of SEIDA's history so far. SEIDA, the filings show, is majority-owned by partnerships now controlled by Zhang and some of the former Siemens EDA colleagues who joined him. It isn't clear when those partnerships were established or by whom. Records show the partnerships invested in SEIDA in November 2021 – weeks after the startup's launch and before Zhang left Siemens EDA. Zhang's path toward SEIDA began at Mentor Graphics Corp, the predecessor company to Siemens EDA, acquired by Munich-based Siemens in 2017. Mentor, started in Oregon in 1981, was an early innovator of EDA and eventually became one of three U.S. companies that sell most of the software worldwide. By the time of its acquisition, Mentor boasted annual revenues of 1.2 billion. With a masters degree in microelectronics from a Shanghai university, Zhang worked for more than a decade at Mentor and Siemens EDA, according to SEIDA’s 2022 presentation to investors. Before joining the startup, he was a Siemens EDA product director. Zhang is now 44 years old, according to U.S. and Chinese records. He became chief executive of SEIDA in July 2022, according to the SEIDA filings. Reuters found that at least three other Chinese-born colleagues who joined Zhang were also longtime employees of Siemens EDA. Two of them, Zhitang \\"Tim\\" Yu and Yun Fei \\"Jack\\" Deng, earned doctorates from U.S. universities, academic records show. Born in China, Yu is also an American citizen, according to U.S. records. Deng, also born in China, obtained legal permanent resident status in the United States. SEIDA declined to make Deng or Yu available for interviews. Under the new export restrictions, U.S. citizens and permanent residents can face penalties if they help Chinese companies develop or manufacture advanced chips without a license. Those penalties can include citations, fines or prison time, depending on the violation. Chang, the chief operating officer, said by email: \\"We continuously monitor both emerging and existing regulations to ensure our operations align with applicable legal standards.\\" As they sought investors last year, SEIDA executives aimed high. In the 2022 slideshow, they projected the company could be worth as much as 700 million yuan, or 99 million, by the end of last year. By 2026, they said, SEIDA hoped to sell shares to the public. Their efforts attracted at least one important backer. In June 2023, SEIDA received undisclosed funding from China Fortune-Tech Capital Co, or CFTC, an investment vehicle owned by chipmaker SMIC, according to records compiled by Datenna and PitchBook Data Inc, a U.S.-based corporate research company. CFTC didn't respond to requests for comment. SEIDA continues to secure investors. This month, according to its corporate filings, five more investors, including four Chinese venture capital firms, acquired stakes in the company. Chang wouldn't say if the ongoing review of SEIDA's business plan means a departure from its early marketing of OPC. \\"Due to the confidential nature of our business strategies, specific details of our current and future plans cannot be disclosed,\\" Chang wrote. During Reuters' visit to SEIDA headquarters, the reception desk bore the same branding as the early fundraising presentation. The SEIDA name, according to the slideshow, is an acronym for \\"Semiconductor Intelligent Design Automation.\\" Its slogan, in the branding and on SEIDA's website, translates to \\"enable chip success.\\" Additional reporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai, David Lague in Hong Kong, and Michael Martina in Washington.

SEIDA’s OPC software is crucial for designing advanced chips. The U.S. is trying to restrict China’s access to such technology. SEIDA aims to help China become self-reliant in chip technology. Zhang lived in the U.S. long enough to secure permanent residency. He was formerly employed by Siemens EDA, which dominates China's market for the technology SEIDA plans to sell. SEIDA attracted powerful backers like SMIC, despite U.S. restrictions. SEIDA's goals and business plans continue to evolve.

Today, T-Mobile announced that SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket launched the first set of Starlink satellites with Direct to Cell capabilities, following the livestreamed webcast last night. This is a significant milestone following last year’s joint announcement of the Coverage Above and Beyond initiative, which aims to bring connectivity nearly everywhere in the U.S. for Un-carrier customers — even in many of the most remote locations previously unreachable by traditional cell signals from any provider … aka dead zones. Now that the satellites are in low-Earth orbit, field testing can soon begin on the new service that will leverage SpaceX’s constellation of satellites with Direct to Cell technology and T-Mobile’s industry-leading wireless network.\\"Our mission is to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world and today is another step forward in keeping our customers connected even in the most remote locations for added peace of mind when they need it most,\\" said Mike Katz, President of Marketing, Strategy and Products, T-Mobile. \\"Today’s launch is a pivotal moment for this groundbreaking alliance with SpaceX and our global partners around the world, as we work to make dead zones a thing of the past.\\"With well over half a million square miles of the U.S. and vast stretches of ocean unreachable by terrestrial network coverage, due to terrain limitations, land-use restrictions and more, this new service aims to give customers a crucial additional layer of connectivity when and where they need it most. With the new service, the goal is to eliminate worrying about mobile dead zones and lugging around expensive satellite phones — Un-carrier customers would be connected nearly everywhere they can see the sky, and in most cases, with the phone they already have.Story continuesToday marks the first of many Starlink satellite launches to come that will include Direct to Cell capabilities. Initially, the service will begin with text messaging, with voice and data coverage to follow in the coming years.\\"The launch of these first Direct to Cell satellites is an exciting milestone for SpaceX to demonstrate our technology,\\" said Dr. Sara Spangelo, Sr. Director of Satellite Engineering. \\"We look forward to rapidly scaling up Direct to Cell with our partner operators around the world and rolling out messaging service for T-Mobile customers!\\"T-Mobile and SpaceX’s shared vision is to provide truly universal coverage and last year, they issued an open invitation to wireless providers worldwide to expand globally with reciprocal roaming. As of today, five wireless providers are already onboard to launch Direct to Cell technology including KDDI (Japan), Optus (Australia), One NZ (New Zealand), Rogers (Canada) and others, with more to come. And the invitation still stands for any carrier with the shared goal of global connectivity to join.

تجدیدپذیر طبیعی عمل کند و در کاهش استفاده از سوخت‌های فسیلی و میزان آلودگی محیط زیست مؤثر باشد. این اختراع می‌تواند به تحقق موج‌های دریایی به عنوان یک منبع اصلی انرژی برای جامعه کمک کند و در ساحل‌نشینی‌ها و مناطقی با دسترسی آسان به دریاها و اقیانوس‌ها کاربرد داشته باشد. اما برای تحقق این اختراع نیاز به توسعه و طراحی دقیق دستگاه‌های تولید انرژی دریایی با رانش دریایی و تبدیل آن به برق است. این دستگاه‌ها باید قابلیت تحمل شرایط سخت دریایی و صحرایی را داشته باشند تا بتوانند به صورت مستمر و پایدار انرژی تولید کنند."},{"instruction":"آیا پول را سپردن به دیگران کار درستی است","output":"پاسخ به این سؤال وابسته به شرایط و موقعیت مختلف است. سپردن پول به دیگران در برخی موارد می‌تواند کار مناسبی باشد، مانند وجود اعتماد کامل به شخص یا نهادی که به آن پول را می‌سپارید و مطمئن هستید که تعهدات مالی را به‌درستی انجام خواهند داد. به عنوان مثال، سپردن پول در بانک‌ها که تحت نظارت سازمان‌های مالی و بانکی است، به طور کلی در جامعه به عنوان یک روش امن برای حفظ و سرمایه گذاری پول مورد پذیرش است. اما در شرایط دیگر، سپردن پول به دیگران ممکن است خطراتی را به همراه داشته باشد. در صورتی که اعتماد به فرد یا نهادی که به آن پول را می‌سپارید، وجود نداشته باشد، خطر از دست دادن پول و یا سوء استفاده از آن وجود دارد. همچنین، توجه به شرایط حقوقی و قانونی مربوط به سپرده‌ها و قوانین مالی کشور در این زمینه نیز مهم است. به طور کلی، موقعیت و شرایط شخصی هر فرد تعیین کننده است و باید بر اساس این شرایط تصمیم گیری کرد. مهم است که قبل از سپردن پول به دیگران، با دقت و کسب اطلاعات لازم، جوانب مثبت و منفی را سنجیده و تحلیل کنید."},{"instruction":"برای کاهش کلسترول چه کنیم","output":"برای کاهش کلسترول خونی، می‌توانید تغییراتی در سبک زندگیتان ایجاد کنید و به رژیم غذایی سالمی توجه کنید. در زیر چند راهکار برای کاهش کلسترول خونی معرفی می‌کنم: 1. تغییر رژیم غذایی: از مصرف غذاهای پرچرب و غنی از کلسترول و چربی اشباع‌شده (مانند گوشت قرمز چرب، فست‌فود، تخم مرغ زرد و... ) خودداری کنید. به جای آن‌ها، مواردی مانند میوه‌ها و سبزیجات، غلات کامل، سبزی‌ها، ماهی، مرغ بدون پوست، مغزها و دانه‌های روغنی با مقدار بالای اسیدهای چرب غیراشباع (مانند روغن زیتون و آووکادو) را در رژیم غذایی خود قرار دهید. 2. کاهش مصرف چربیهای اشباع‌شده: از مصرف محصولات شیری کامل چرب، کره، روغن نخل، روغن کرنل پالم و روغن‌های سرخ کرده خودداری کنید. 3. افزایش مصرف فیبر: مواد غذایی حاوی فیبر بالا مانند حبوبات، سبزیجات خام و پخته، میوه‌ها، کیوی، آجیل و غلات کامل را در رژیم غذایی خود اضافه کنید. فیبر می‌تواند به جذب کلسترول LDL کمک کند. 4. فعالیت بدنی: ورزش و فعالیت بدنی منظم می‌تواند به بالا بردن کلسترول خوب (HDL) و کاهش کلسترول بد (LDL) در همراهی با رژیم غذایی مناسب کمک کند. برای شروع، می‌توانید به مدت حداقل 30 دقیقه در روز، 5 روز در هفته انواع ورزش را انتخاب کنید. 5. کاهش استرس: استرس می‌تواند تاثیر منفی بر سلامت قلبی-عروقی داشته باشد و کلسترول را افزایش دهد. برای کاهش استرس می‌توانید از روش‌های تنفس عمیق، مدیتیشن، یوگا و فعالیت‌های آرام بگیرید. همچنین، قبل از هرگونه تغییر در رژیم غذایی و وضعیت سلامتی خود، توصیه می‌شود با پزشک خود مشورت کنید. پزشک شما می‌تواند هدایت شما را براساس وضعیت خاص سلامتیتان و نیازهای شخصیتان انجام دهد."},{"instruction":"بخوریم که فشار خونمون بیاید پایین","output":"برای کاهش فشار خون، می‌توانید از روش‌های زیر استفاده کنید: 1. رژیم غذایی سالم: مصرف مواد غذایی بدون چربی اشباع، کم نمک، و غنی از مواد غذایی سالم مانند میوه‌ها، سبزیجات، غلات کامل و ماهی‌های آبزی استفاده کنید. همچنین، به منظور کاهش سطح فشار خون، می‌توانید مصرف سدیم (نمک) را محدود کنید. 2. وزن مناسب: در صورت داشتن اضافه وزن، تلاش کنید تا وزن خود را به میزان خوبی کنترل کنید. به کمک تغییرات در رژیم غذایی و افزایش فعالیت بدنی، به تدریج وزن خود را کاهش دهید. 3. مدیریت استرس: استرس می‌تواند تأثیر بدی بر فشار خون داشته باشد. تا آنجا که ممکن است، سعی کنید استرس روزمره خود را کاهش دهید. از تمرینات تنفس عمیق، مدیتیشن، یوگا و روش‌های سایر آرامش‌بخش استفاده کنید. 4. محدود کردن مصرف الکل: مصرف مقدار معتدل الکل ممکن است برای برخی افراد مفید باشد. با این حال، بیش از حد مصرف الکل می‌تواند فشار خون را افزایش دهد. 5. فعالیت بدنی: انجام فعالیت‌های ورزشی همچون پیاده‌روی، شنا، دوچرخه‌سواری و یا هرگونه تمرین قلبی-عروقی، می‌تواند به کاهش فشار خون کمک کند. توصیه می‌شود حداقل 150 دقیقه در هفته وقت برای فعالیت بدنی اختصاص دهید. 6. پیگیری مرتب و مداوم: با مشاوره پزشک خود، فشارخون خود را بررسی و کنترل کنید. مصرف داروهای مرتبط با کاهش فشارخون را فراموش نکنید و از دستورات پزشک خود پیروی کنید. در هر صورت، بهتر است با پزشک خود مشورت کنید تا بتوانند بر اساس وضعیت شخصی شما، راهکارهای بهتری را برای کاهش فشار خونتان تعریف کنند."},{"instruction":"آیا ختنه کردن مفید است","output":"ختنه کردن می‌تواند به‌عنوان یک عمل جراحی اختیاری در برخی فرهنگ‌ها و تمدن‌ها صورت پذیرد. در برخی موارد، ختنه به‌عنوان عضو بخشی از عبادت دینی، فرهنگ بومی یا به دلایل فرهنگی برخی جوامع، به‌ویژه در کشورهای مشترکه‌یهودیان و مسلمانان و برخی ادیان دیگر، انجام می‌شود. اداره کیفیت بهداشت جهانی یونیسف و سازمان جهانی بهداشت هر دو موافقت دادند که ختنه در شرایط بهداشتی مناسب و تحت نظارت پزشکان متخصص، به‌طور کلی ایمن است. ختنه در برخی موارد می‌تواند به مشکلاتی همچون کاهش خطر ابتلا به برخی امراض، مثل عفونت‌های ادراری و برخی بیماری‌های جنسی، کمک کند. همچنین، ختنه می‌تواند در کاهش خطر انتشار بعضی بیماری‌ها مانند ایدز برای فرد و یا آمادگی بهداشتی و بهره‌مندی از امکانات بهداشتی در شرایطی که منابع محدود هستند، مؤثر باشد. با این حال، ختنه انجام شده به طور نادرست، در محیط‌های بهداشتی نامناسب یا توسط افراد غیرماهر و بدون ضرورت پزشکی، ممکن است عفونت‌ها و مشکلات جدی دیگری را به دنبال داشته باشد. البته ارائه پیام‌ها و اطلاعات استاندارد به زنان و خانواده‌ها درباره عمل ختنه، از جمله ممنوعیت هرگونه ختنه تسهیلاتی که توسط اشخاص بی‌تجویز و بدون مهارت برای عمل ختنه از آن استفاده می‌شود، توصیه‌های ایمنی در انجام ختنه و تأمین و استفاده از زیرساخت‌های بهداشتی و بهداشتی-تسهیلاتی نمونه‌هایی از اقدامات مؤثر در کاهش عوارض و مشکلات ناشی از ختنه هستند."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “So, last night, I met a girl from

It was a black and white film produced by Hollywood, with sound, in comedy genre, plot in the end contain scandal scene about murder in house, then bandits taking people from house as hostages and walking with them into secret underground cave to use the boat.","output":"The movie you're describing sounds like it could be \\"The Cat and the Canary\\" (1927) directed by Paul Leni, but there might be a mix-up since this is a silent film, although it is a black-and-white horror-comedy. The plot involves a mansion with an inheritance that leads to a series of mysterious and comedic/scary events. However, the scene with the bandits taking people hostage and using a boat in a secret underground cave isn't part of this film's plot. If this does not sound like the correct movie, there may be key details that are amiss or the movie might be less well-known. Recalling any specific character details, actors, or even the era more narrowly could help in identifying the film. Additionally, if the film was possibly a part of a larger serial or a lesser-known production, it may require a more in-depth search to identify. It's also worth noting that the 1939 movie \\"The Cat and the Canary\\" is a sound remake that is also black and white and might feature some expanded or altered plot details. Still, the plot you described doesn't seem to match completely with either version. If you have any more information or if there are other distinct plot points, character names, or specific scenes you remember, please share them, and I'll do my best to help identify the film."},{"instruction":"I need the name of the cinema movie by description of the plot. It was a black and white film produced by Hollywood, with sound, in comedy genre, plot in the end contain scandal scene with police about one mansion guest hooliganism, then scene of secret underground cave to use the boat.","output":"Based on the updated information, the film you're describing sounds like it might be \\"The Old Dark House\\" (1932). However, this movie is primarily categorized as a horror-comedy rather than a straight comedy. Directed by James Whale and produced by Universal Studios, \\"The Old Dark House\\" features a group of travelers who take refuge in a mysterious mansion during a storm. The mansion is inhabited by an eccentric family with many secrets. The film is notable for its blending of horror and comedy, and it was made during the early sound era of Hollywood films. While it does feature several comedic moments and a scandal scene involving the eccentric behavior of the mansion's inhabitants, there isn't a specific scene matching the one with a secret underground cave and a boat as part of the climax. As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, there is a possibility that the film in question is not one of the widely recognized classics, which makes pinpointing the exact movie challenging based on the general description. It could also be a sequence from a different black-and-white sound comedy that contains a mix of these elements but is not as well-documented. If \\"The Old Dark House\\" does not seem like the correct movie, additional details such as character names, specific actors, or more plot particulars could help narrow down the search. Unfortunately, without further detail, it remains difficult to specify the exact black-and-white comedy movie being described."},{"instruction":"no, it was wrong. Let's just narrow to all black and white movies with sound with scene at the end of the secret underground water cave under the house.","output":"The specific detail of an underground water cave beneath a house is not a commonly recurring element in many films, which can make pinpointing the exact movie somewhat difficult. However, based on the unique nature of this plot detail, here's a guess: \\"The Bat\\" (1959) - This film is a black-and-white sound film that features a mansion with hidden rooms and secret passages. It's a mystery/crime film with elements of horror, involving a master criminal known as \\"The Bat\\" who is searching for a hidden loot of bank securities. Towards the end of the film, characters discover a secret room, but not exactly an underground water cave with a boat as you described. Earlier adaptations of \\"The Bat\\" could also contain similar elements, as the story was adapted multiple times, including a 1926 silent film and a 1930 early sound film called \\"The Bat Whispers.\\" These films were based on the 1920 Broadway play \\"The Bat\\" by Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood, which was a mystery-comedy. If the film you're looking for is indeed one that involves a hidden cave with water under a house that ends with a boat scene, it might not be a mainstream Hollywood film or perhaps it mixes elements from different films. For further assistance, consider providing more context, such as the era when the film was likely produced (1930s, 1940s, etc.), or any actors you might recall. This could help narrow the search significantly. Also, check whether the memory of this scene could be from a television episode or a lesser-known B-movie, as these details can often blur together."},{"instruction":"i remember that actor Mantan Moreland played in that film","output":"With the inclusion of Mantan Moreland in your description, this significantly narrows down the possibilities. Mantan Moreland was an African-American actor known for his roles in the 1930s and 1940s, often providing comic relief. He is perhaps most recognized for his role as Birmingham Brown in the Charlie Chan series. Given your description, the film you might be thinking of could be \\"King of the Zombies\\" (1941). In this black-and-white horror-comedy, Moreland plays a character named Jeff who, along with other characters, ends up on a creepy island with a mansion that has hidden passages and a mad scientist. While the plot does not specifically include an underground water cave with a boat, the film's atmosphere and Moreland's comedic presence line up with your criteria, and it's possible there's a mix-up with specific plot details. However, if this still doesn't seem to be the right film, another possibility given Moreland's filmography could be \\"The Hidden Hand\\" (1942), which is a comedy-thriller involving a crazy family in a creepy old mansion with secret passages and hidden rooms. This plot shares the tone of what you've described, but again, the detail of an underground water cave and a boat might not align perfectly. If neither of these movies is correct, it's possible that the specific underground water cave and boat scene could be misremembered or it might stem from another film entirely. It's also worth noting that some of the smaller budget films from that era, which Moreland often featured in, weren't as well documented or as easily accessible in modern times. If the movie you are looking for is indeed a different one featuring Mantan Moreland but is not widely recognized, it might prove helpful to look into a comprehensive list of his filmography to possibly spot the title that matches your description."},{"instruction":"wrong, what other candidates?","output":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. With the additional detail that Mantan Moreland is in the film, another potential candidate matching your description could be \\"Spider Baby or, The Maddest Story Ever Told\\" (1967), although this film is outside of the usual era associated with Moreland's career peak. However, given your description of a black and white sound film with a comedy element and a specific scene featuring an underground water cave, along with the presence of Mantan Moreland, the correct movie is likely \\"Charlie Chan at Treasure Island\\" (1939). In this film, Mantan Moreland plays the character of Chattanooga Brown, and the plot involves Charlie Chan investigating a series of mysterious deaths with ties to a phony psychic and a hidden treasure. The climax of the movie features an exciting scene in a underground caverns, which might have caused the mix-up with the water cave memory. Please note that while this movie comes close to your description, there may still be some differences in details. If this is still not the movie you are thinking of, it would be helpful to have more specifics about the film or scenes in question."},{"instruction":"it's not that, what other candidates?","output":"Apologies for the previous incorrect attempts. Considering Mantan Moreland's extensive filmography, another movie to consider is \\"The Chinese Cat\\" (1944). Moreland played Birmingham Brown, a chauffeur turned assistant detective, in this and several other films in the Charlie Chan series. The film involves a murder mystery inside a house and, like other Charlie Chan films, often includes various secret passages. However, it may still not match the specific ending you have described with a secret underground water cave and a boat. Given the difficulty in matching your detailed ending involving an underground cave and a boat to Mantan Moreland's known film appearances, and considering that sometimes individual memories can blend elements from multiple movies, it's also possible that the film you're remembering is quite obscure or that the details have been conflated with scenes from different films over time. One more film to consider that features Mantan Moreland is \\"King of the Zombies\\" (1941), which does involve some elements of espionage and secret passages, but it does not end with an underground cave or boat scene as described. Unfortunately, without more precise details or clarifications, it remains challenging to positively identify the film you're recalling. If 'The Chinese Cat' or 'King of the Zombies' are also not the film you're seeking, and if Mantan Moreland's involvement is a certain detail, it might be beneficial to scan through film summaries of his other works or to verify if the details recalled might indeed be from a different movie or perhaps a combination of moments from several films."},{"instruction":"wrong, what next variants?","output":"Given the information provided and the difficulty in finding a match, I may have overlooked a critical film in Mantan Moreland's career. After considering his roles and the plot points you've described, there is one film that fits closely: \\"King of the Zombies\\" (1941) This film features Mantan Moreland in a prominent comedy relief role alongside a plot involving a mansion on an island with secret passages, espionage elements, and zombies. The characters discover a hidden basement, which, while not exactly an underground water cave with a boat, might have been confused or misremembered. If \\"King of the Zombies\\" is still not the film you're referring to, I apologize for any confusion. Unfortunately, Moreland's filmography does not appear to include a film that exactly matches all of the specifics you've described—a black-and-white sound film with a comedic slant that concludes with a scandal involving police, a mansion, hostages, and a secret underground water cave ending in an escape by boat. The criteria you've outlined might be exceeding the boundaries of a single film and blending scenes or elements from several different movies. Memory can sometimes conflate different sources into a single narrative, especially when considering films watched long ago. Since we've gone through several of Mantan Moreland's most prominent films without success, it might be useful to consider the following steps: 1. Revisit Mantan Moreland's complete filmography to find titles that sound familiar or might be connected to the scenes you remember. 2. Reflect on other actors or specific scenes that could provide additional clues. 3. Confirm whether the described scenes could be part of a television series or short film, as these might not be as well documented or widely recognized as feature-length films. Without more information or a more detailed scene to work with, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if you come up with any additional details, please feel free to share them, and I'll do my best to assist you further."},{"instruction":"it's wrong match","output":"Given the difficulty in identifying the film based on the provided information, it's possible that either the film is obscure and not well-documented, or the details might be mixed up. One more effort considering Mantan Moreland's involvement in films with a mansion, secret passages, or underground elements would prompt us to look into any B-movies or lesser-known films from the era that potentially could include such plot devices. A couple more movies featuring Mantan Moreland that have elements of mystery include: 1. \\"Phantom of 42nd Street\\" (1945) - Mantan Moreland appears in this film, which is a murder mystery involving a theatre. However, there is no underground cave as part of the plot. 2. \\"Mystery in Swing\\" (1940) - Moreland has a role in this film, which is centered around a murder at a nightclub. Once again, this doesn't feature the climactic scene you describe. Since Moreland was known for his roles in horror-comedy films and the Charlie Chan series, there may be a movie that includes a combination of elements like those you've described, but not specifically an underground water cave with a boat. I must acknowledge that the film you're describing remains elusive based on your current description and the inclusion of Mantan Moreland. If you have any more information – perhaps remembering a line of dialogue, the appearance of another character, or a more detailed context – that could be useful. Otherwise, I regret that I am not able to provide the title of the film you're looking for at this time."},{"instruction":"what other candidates? Any movie with underground water cave under the mansion?","output":"Unfortunately, Mantan Moreland's known filmography doesn't appear to contain a movie that perfectly matches your description of a black-and-white comedic Hollywood film with an underground water cave beneath a mansion. Considering Hollywood films with sound and the element of an underground cave, but without the specific inclusion of Mantan Moreland, another film that comes to mind—not a comedy though—is \\"Niagara\\" (1953), starring Marilyn Monroe. This film is in color, but it features a climactic scene with a cave-like setting near the falls, which is a well-known scene but does not match your description entirely. Films with underground elements sometimes blur into adventure or horror genres. For example, \\"House on Haunted Hill\\" (1959) starring Vincent Price and directed by William Castle includes secret passages and a vat of acid in the cellar, but it lacks the water cave and hostage scenario you've described. Since we've expanded beyond Mantan Moreland's filmography, there are a vast number of potential films to consider, and without a more specific match, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. The underground water cave element is distinctive but not a widely used trope in Hollywood films, and this might be why it's challenging to find an exact match. It is also possible that the scene is from a film serial or a lesser-known B-movie from the era when black-and-white films were in abundance. Film serials, in particular, often had cliffhanger elements with secret caves and underground passages, though they typically leaned more towards the adventure genre rather than comedy. Would you be able to provide any additional context, like a notable line of dialogue, the appearance of another actor or character, or additional plot details? These could potentially unlock the mystery of which film you're recalling. Without further details, it remains difficult to confirm the exact title."},{"instruction":"exclude that actor, are there any movie by last 100 years made with underground water cave with boat under the mansion using secret door?","output":"Your refined query makes it clear that we're looking for a film with a specific set piece—a mansion with a secret door leading to an underground water cave where a boat is used. While Mantan Moreland is no longer a factor in this search, it's still a challenge because this is a very specific scenario. There aren't many films that feature all of these elements, especially within the comedy genre. However, I can suggest a couple of movies that have some of the elements: 1. \\"The Goonies\\" (1985): This is a color film from the 1980s, but it features a group of kids who find a hidden pirate treasure map that leads them through underground caves filled with traps and eventually to a pirate ship laden with treasure. It is an adventure-comedy and has several scenes with water and boats underground, although not beneath a mansion. 2. \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" (2001): This action-adventure film, again not black-and-white or a comedy, includes Lara Croft discovering a secret door in her mansion that leads to an underground area where a boat is involved. It has the secret door and mansion elements but is set in a modern context. Since black-and-white films with sound encompass many decades of cinema, the possibilities are quite expansive, with many mysteries, comedies, and adventure films potentially having such a scene. Unfortunately, without additional information to narrow down the time frame or genre further, the film you’re looking for could be quite obscure or not mapped correctly to the description provided. If any readers recognize the plot described and can think of a movie that matches all of these criteria—a black-and-white sound film in any genre with an underground water cave accessed by a secret door in a mansion that features a boat—it would certainly help narrow down the search. In the absence of more specific details, it's possible the film in question is a lesser-known work, a B-movie, or even a segment within a movie that's otherwise not about the cave itself."},{"instruction":"which candidates from black and white film?","output":"Finding a black and white film with an underground water cave beneath a mansion that ends with characters utilizing a secret boat is quite a specific ask. Unfortunately, this is not a common theme, and there appears to be no exact match among the more famous and well-documented films within that period. However, there is a similar scenario in the film adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel \\"And Then There Were None.\\" The novel itself doesn't feature the exact scene described, but there have been various adaptations, and sometimes film adaptations add extra elements or scenes that were not present in the original story. The 1945 adaptation of \\"And Then There Were None\\" is a black and white film that ends in a house with secret passages and a sense of entrapment on an isolated island. However, the specifics of an underground water cave and a boat do not match. Given the lack of a direct match from well-known films, we may need to consider that the film in question is a lesser-known B-movie, or it might be an amalgamation of different movie memories combined into one. The scene described may also be from a low-budget thriller or horror film of the time, which may not be widely remembered or cataloged today. Furthermore, films from the silent era up to the 1960s that were not preserved or were lost could potentially contain such elements. Unfortunately, lost films cannot be referenced easily if they haven't survived or been restored. Unless more specific information can be provided, such as a character name, an actor other than Mantan Moreland, or more context for the scene, it is extremely difficult to identify a film based on the scene described. Film records and databases might not have indexed a film based on such a specific and less notable plot point, especially if it's from an obscure production."},{"instruction":"can you make such movie?","output":"As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I'm not equipped to physically create movies or any tangible content.

Here's a brief concept outline based on your description: Title: \\"Secrets Under the Silver Estate\\" Genre: Black and White Comedy-Mystery Plot Outline: In the late 1940s, a whimsical millionaire and inventor, Reginald Silver, unexpectedly passes away, leaving behind his massive estate and a set of cryptic clues that suggest a hidden treasure somewhere within. Silver's eccentric will dictates that a disparate group of distant relatives and quirky individuals (including a bumbling detective, a failed actress, a discredited scientist, and other colorful characters) must stay in his mansion for one night to uncover the treasure and earn their share of his legacy. As night falls, the guests explore the labyrinthine mansion, encountering a series of humorous mishaps, puzzling inventions, and secret passages. Amid the chaos, a tale of an old family scandal unravels, hinting at a murder that took place years ago in connection with the treasure. In the film's climax, the guests discover a hidden door in the mansion's cellar that leads to an extensive underground water cave. A classic slapstick sequence occurs as they awkwardly maneuver an old boat through the cave, navigating in the dark while trying to outdo each other for the treasure. Twist: The treasure turns out to be a ploy by Silver to reunite his estranged family members and make amends for a lifetime of eccentricity and detachment. The real \\"treasure\\" is the friendships and connections they've formed over the night, and the resolution of the old murder case that haunted the family. If you like this concept, you could develop it into a more detailed screenplay or story, fleshing out the characters, dialogue, and specific comedic scenarios. Should you want to actually create the film, you would need to partner with filmmakers, producers, and other industry professionals to bring the project to life."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"Certainly! Let's flesh out the concept a bit further: Title: \\"Secrets Under the Silver Estate\\" Plot Development: Throughout the night at the Silver Estate, guests' personalities clash and alliances form as they search for the treasure. The bumbling detective, almost by accident, unearths clues that suggest Reginald Silver's death might not have been as straightforward as it seemed. Meanwhile, the other characters contend with their own shortcomings and secrets, all humorously exaggerated within the confines of the mansion's walls. The failed actress attempts to dramatize every situation, the discredited scientist believes the mansion's oddities are signs of alien life, and a paranoid historian is convinced that the mansion is haunted by the original Silver patriarch, a rumored pirate. Climactic Sequence: As the night progresses, they collectively stumble upon a hidden lever in the library, revealed by an awkward mishap involving a chase and a flying book. This lever opens a secret passage that leads down into a dark, musty tunnel. With only their resolve and flickering flashlights, the group carefully navigates the treacherous underground path. The cave is filled with echoes of dripping water and the distant sound of waves, hinting at its connection to the sea. As they move forward, they find a rickety wooden boat adorned with the Silver family crest. They hesitantly board the boat, arguing over who should steer and who's going to bail out the water. Comic Conflicts and Resolutions: Amidst their nautical misadventures, true colors shine through. The detective shows unexpected courage, the actress finds authenticity in the real-life drama, and the scientist has an epiphany about using his knowledge for practical solutions. As they reach the end of the cave, they find themselves at a small hidden dock. The \\"treasure\\" is revealed to be an ornate chest containing nothing but old trinkets and a letter from Reginald Silver. The letter apologizes for his past actions, explains the staged treasure hunt as a way to make amends, and encourages them to find value in one another rather than material wealth. The true treasure was the journey they underwent together, learning to work as a team and facing their personal fears. Ending: As dawn breaks, the group emerges from the cave back into the mansion, changed by the night's ordeal. They decide to honor Reginald's last wish by turning the mansion into a place of communal learning and discovery, embracing the quirks of Silver's inventions and the rich history of the estate. The historian takes on the role of curator, the actress becomes an enthusiastic tour guide, the scientist sets up a laboratory, and the detective becomes the estate's quirky security chief. In the spirit of togetherness, they toast to a new beginning as the sun illuminates the Silver Estate, no longer a place of dark secrets but of shared adventures and renewed laughter."},{"instruction":"BRAVO!","output":"Thank you!

Let's refine the concept a tad more, focusing on fleshing out the characters and their motivations, which will help add depth to the storyline and the humor: **Character Development:** - **Detective Horatio Knobble**: A well-intentioned but bungling detective whose claim to fame is solving a high-profile case by sheer accident. Eager to prove his competence, he's constantly analyzing the wrong clues but somehow stumbles into the truth. - **Vivienne LaRue**: An overly dramatic actress who never landed a career-defining role. She's prone to theatrics and fainting at the slightest provocation yet has a heart of gold and is fiercely protective of her fellow guests when the situation calls for it. - **Dr. Elton Higginbotham**: A scientist and inventor whose theories and gadgets are often dismissed by mainstream academia. His kooky demeanor hides a sharp mind that eventually helps the group navigate the treacherous waters of the underground cave. - **Eugenia Rutherford**: A history buff and self-proclaimed medium who believes she can communicate with the spirits of the Silver Estate. Her shivers and 'seances' add to the mansion’s eerie atmosphere, but she has an uncanny ability to decipher cryptic historical clues. **Plot Improvements:** - **Mansion Secrets**: Dive deeper into Reginald Silver's past to reveal he was a renowned magician and illusionist, explaining the elaborate tricks and traps within the mansion and elevating the adventurous treasure hunt. - **Dynamic Interactions**: Add scenes where characters' fears and aspirations come into play. For instance, a scene where Vivienne must \\"perform\\" to distract a potential trespasser or rival treasure hunter, using her acting skills for a real purpose. - **Cave Challenges**: Introduce obstacles within the underground water cave, such as deciphering ancient symbols or solving mechanical puzzles, which play to each character's strengths and compel them to work together. - **Redemption Arc**: Incorporate a subplot where one character (perhaps a guest with a rumored shady past) seeks redemption by helping to navigate the boat through the cave, showing courage and ingenuity after initially being distrusted by the group. **Ending Enhancement:** After discovering Reginald Silver's letter, the group has a heartfelt discussion about their experiences and how their perspective on life has shifted. This moment of reflection can add emotional weight to the comedic narrative and offer each character a small arc of personal growth. Should you wish to make this story into a screenplay or any other form of narrative, there are many scriptwriting and storytelling resources available that can help you outline scenes, develop dialogue, and structure your story.

The set would capture the Edwardian era's aesthetic, with period costumes and props, complemented by authentic suffrage banners, sashes, and posters. **Prospective Involvement of Joan Littlewood:** Given Joan Littlewood's penchant for creating theatre that was both entertaining and socially conscious, one could imagine her taking a keen interest in \\"Suffragette City: Echoes of Change,\\" finding passion in its historical roots and its power to resonate with contemporary audiences. Littlewood might use her signature workshop techniques to develop the characters collaboratively with the actors, ensuring a genuine and dynamic portrayal of the era's social struggles.

Meanwhile, the enterprising pie baker, Agnes Merryweather, seeks a partnership, eyeing an opportunity to expand her meat pie business. As orders for glue—and pies—unexpectedly soar, the town buzzes with unsettling theories about the disappearing equine populace.

Dark, wooden, industrial cogs and gears accent the backdrop, while a fog machine adds an eerie mist to the atmosphere, complementing the play's macabre humor. **Themes and Dramatic Elements:** While the story is lighthearted and farcical, undercurrents of darker, melodramatic satire question the ethics of industry and commerce.

The door bursts open with a dramatic creak as Reginald and Cecil, the horse traders, saunter in with the air of superiority only a lifetime of horse trading can bestow. **Reginald:** (flourishing a hat) Good day, Mr. Blenkinsop! We come bearing opportunities most... lucrative! (He bows absurdly low.) **Josiah:** (skepticism and hope warring on his face) Opportunities? I'm all ears, so long as they don't cost an arm or a leg. **Cecil:** (grinning) Nay, Sir! Just a bit of hoof and tail is all we ask. (He chuckles at his own joke.) Reginald leans in, his voice dropping to an exaggerated whisper. **Reginald:** We've heard tell of your establishment's... erm, sticky situation.

After a beat, Josiah stands and extends his hand, which Reginald and Cecil shake in turn, their grins broadening. **Josiah:** (with a wary smile) Alright, you devils.

As the horse traders turn to leave, Reginald half-stumbles over a stray hoof, producing a farcical hop and a skip. He recovers with an awkward laugh, trying to maintain his dignity. Josiah watches them leave, the weight of the pact settling over him as he turns back to his ledger, now with equal parts hope and trepidation. **Josiah:** (muttering) I've either brokered the deal of the century, or I've just bought a one-way ticket to Bedlam.

Officers from the local constabulary, Chief Inspector Thompson and Constable Green, approach him, their faces a mixture of pity and sternness. The police carriage, hitched with a horse, idles nearby. **Constable Green:** (placing a hand on Josiah's shoulder) Mr. Blenkinsop? It's time, sir. We must ask you some questions. Josiah flinches, the reality of destruction compounded with accusation too much to bear. **Josiah:** (voice hoarse from smoke and defeat) Questions, is it? 'Bout what may have caused this unfortunate blaze, I presume? **Inspector Thompson:** (noting Josiah's demeanor) That, and the matter of the missing horses – rumors have been swirling like the smoke above us. **Constable Green:** (softer) There were whispers of underhanded dealings, Josiah. Missing horses, your sudden spike in... production. It looks dire, sir. A sudden, frenzied neighing pierces the somber scene; the horse at the police carriage rears up as if in response to an unheard verdict. Josiah, startled, stumbles backward. His gaze lifts to meet the dark eyes of the horse, now settled uneasily in its harness. **Josiah:** (with a bitter chuckle) It seems even the beasts conspire to judge me. **Inspector Thompson:** (handing Josiah a handkerchief) Clean yourself, man.

We all have our parts in this tragedy, myself, the horse traders, the baker! What would you have us do? Starve? Fade into the fog like old ghosts?

Let’s not make a spectacle. As Josiah is led away, the question of his innocence or guilt hangs as heavy as the acrid smoke in the air. The closing image is of Josiah looking back at the blackened ruins, then at the horse, which calms and watches him with inscrutable eyes. The animal's breath mingles with the chilled night air, creating a vanishing mist that seems to whisper of the tenuous bonds between man and nature, success and downfall. Inspector Thompson shakes his head, a mixture of empathy and duty in his eyes, as he follows his constable and the unfortunate Josiah to the carriage. **Inspector Thompson:** (under his breath) Bedlam or the Bench, Josiah—only the truth shall steer your course now.

There’s one particular problematic 3 year old girl called Lily who unknowingly has the mysterious power to regress the age of others and make her grow up faster, as just a month ago she was just 1 year old, but she absorbed the age from some of the toddler orphans and they regressed back into babies, forgot words and have to be in diapers again. Can Sapphire manage to watch over Lily, keep her away from regressing the other kids, and avoid regressing herself? and if not, just how young will she get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether Sapphire manages to resist Lily’s powers, and if she can’t, by how much she regresses and by how much Lily grows in return. The more she regresses, the more difficult it’d be for her to control Lily and be respected by the other orphans at the orphanage (kids there are up to age 12) and be reliable in the eyes of the headmistress. If Lily grows up to the age of 8, she becomes aware of her powers, which gives her a bonus to them, and will seek to regress Sapphire intentionally so she herself can grow up and become a teenager. Tell me when to roll and I’ll tell you the result of my rolls. Regressing will give Sapphire penalties to her future rolls.","output":"Sapphire stepped through the old, creaking doors of the orphanage, the familiar scents and sights flooding her with a mix of nostalgia and determination. The headmistress, a stern yet kind woman named Mrs. Evergreen, greeted her with a mix of relief and worry. \\"Sapphire, thank goodness you're here. As you know, Lily has been... a challenge,\\" Mrs. Evergreen sighed, her glance shifting toward the little girl with chestnut curls innocently playing with blocks in the corner. \\"Her power is beyond our understanding, and we can't afford to let her near the younger children unsupervised.\\" Sapphire nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. The headmistress handed her a silver locket, ancient and ornate. \\"This amulet may offer some protection against her abilities. Keep it on at all times,\\" she advised with a serious tone. Sapphire affixed the locket around her neck and approached Lily with a smile, though her heart raced with apprehension. Her task was clear: keep Lily safe and entertained, and prevent any more accidents. **Start of Roleplay Scenario** *First Task: Distracting Lily* Sapphire devised a plan to distract Lily by engaging her in a game that would keep her focus away from the other children. \\"Lily, would you like to play a game of make-believe with me? We could be princesses in a grand castle!\\" **Roll d20 for Sapphire's success in distracting Lily** (Roll now) *If Successful (11-20):* Sapphire manages to engage Lily successfully, keeping her away from the other children and mitigating the risk of age regression for now. *If Unsuccessful (1-10):* Lily grows bored or is not fully engaged, creating a risky situation. Sapphire must quickly come up with another tactic to keep Lily's power at bay. **Progression with Lily** As the day continues, Sapphire must remain vigilant. Balancing the care of Lily with her responsibilities towards the other orphans is challenging. She keeps a close eye on Lily, trying to foresee any signs of her powers activating. **Roll d20 for Sapphire's general vigilance throughout the day** (Roll after completing the first task) *If Successful (11-20):* Sapphire's attentiveness pays off, and she prevents any incidents. She grows more confident in managing Lily's powers. *If Unsuccessful (1-10):* Sapphire begins to notice a tingle, the edges of her vision blurring as Lily's power starts to affect her. Sapphire must act quickly to remove herself from Lily's presence or risk regressing. **Roll d20 to determine the extent of regression should Sapphire fail to keep her guard up** (Roll if the vigilance roll is unsuccessful) *Roll Results:* - 1-5: Sapphire regresses significantly. She loses years and must deal with the complexities of being much younger. - 6-10: Sapphire experiences a mild regression. She becomes younger but retains most of her faculties. - 11-15: Sapphire feels the effects but manages to retain her current age, albeit with more difficulty in performing her tasks. - 16-20: Sapphire shakes off the effects, the amulet's protection proving its worth. Throughout the scenario, should Lily's age increase as a result of her powers, the situation at the orphanage becomes more complex. Sapphire may need to find a way to reverse the effects while keeping herself from further regression. Commence with the rolls as the situation progresses, and let's see how Sapphire's story unfolds."},{"instruction":"first roll: 3","output":"The attempt to distract Lily with a game of make-believe does not go as planned. Lily seems only momentarily interested before her attention drifts, her gaze wandering towards the other children. Sapphire can feel the uncertainty in the air as Lily's powers linger, almost palpable. With the unsuccessful attempt to engage Lily, Sapphire must think quickly on her feet to come up with another plan to maintain control over the situation and prevent the young girl from unintentionally using her powers on the other children or herself. **Next Step: Quick Recovery Plan** Sapphire decides to shift tactics and attempt to involve Lily in a more physically engaging activity, hoping that a bit of tiring play may keep her powers at bay. **Roll d20 for Sapphire's success in involving Lily in a physical activity** (Roll now) *If Successful (11-20):* Sapphire finds an activity that fully engages Lily, possibly a scavenger hunt or a playful obstacle course set up in a safe area. *If Unsuccessful (1-10):* The physical activity fails to captivate Lily, increasing the risk of her power activating due to restlessness or emotional upset. Sapphire must stay even closer to the child and perhaps seek the help of the headmistress or try to use the amulet's power to protect the orphans. Please roll the d20 for Sapphire's second attempt at controlling the situation."},{"instruction":"4","output":"Sapphire's second attempt to occupy Lily with a physical activity does not fare any better. Whether it's a scavenger hunt or a game of tag, Lily's attention quickly wanes, and she remains restless. Her glances towards the other children grow more frequent, and the air feels thick with potential danger. Concerned, Sapphire now faces an even greater challenge. She must be able to react swiftly to prevent Lily from accidentally using her powers, while also looking for a more reliable way to manage the situation. **Urgent Contingency Action** Sensing the urgency, Sapphire decides to seek the assistance of Mrs. Evergreen. Perhaps together, they can come up with a solution that will help to better control Lily's powers or find a way to pacify her before anything goes awry. **Roll d20 for successfully getting help from Mrs. Evergreen before an incident occurs** (Roll now) *If Successful (11-20):* Sapphire manages to involve Mrs. Evergreen just in time, and they work together to prevent any mishaps. They may come up with a containment strategy or find a way to safely distract Lily. *If Unsuccessful (1-10):* Sapphire is not fast enough to involve Mrs. Evergreen or find a solution on her own. Lily's powers may activate unwittingly, threatening to regress those around her. Please roll the d20 for Sapphire's contingency action to seek help from the headmistress."},{"instruction":"5","output":"With a roll of 5, Sapphire's urgency to seek help from Mrs. Evergreen does not result in a timely intervention. As she makes her way towards the headmistress's office, the distance feels farther than ever, each step heavy with dread. Before Sapphire can vocalize her concerns to Mrs. Evergreen, a commotion erupts from the playroom. The unmistakable sound of confusion and distress tells Sapphire that she's too late; Lily's powers have been unleashed once more. **Consequence of Lily's Power Activation** Turning swiftly, Sapphire rushes back to find several children looking disoriented and younger than they were just moments ago. Lily stands in the center, her body slightly more mature than before, confusion and fear etched on her now four-year-old face. Sapphire feels an odd sensation, an almost imperceptible pull at the edges of her existence. She clutches at the silver locket, hoping its protection is enough to shield her from regressing too much – or at all. **Roll d20 to determine the extent of Sapphire's regression due to Lily's power surge** (Roll now) *Roll Results:* - 1-5: Sapphire regresses several years, becoming a young child herself, greatly diminishing her ability to help at the orphanage. - 6-10: Sapphire experiences a moderate regression, losing a few years and experiencing the confusion and challenges that come with a younger mind and body. - 11-15: Sapphire feels the effects only slightly, battling the regression with some success, thanks in part to the amulet's protection. - 16-20: Sapphire manages to pull through with minimal effect, the amulet proving its worth by protecting her from the brunt of Lily's powers. Please roll the d20 to find out the impact of Lily's unintentional power surge on Sapphire."},{"instruction":"3","output":"With a roll of 3, the protective magic of the locket around Sapphire's neck struggles against the formidable power of Lily’s unintended age regression. The room spins slightly as a wave of energy washes over her, and her perspective on the room shifts downward suddenly. Sapphire feels her clothes becoming looser, her limbs shrinking, and her thoughts beginning to haze as she rapidly loses several years, regressing into a young child. Her ability to handle the complexities of the situation and her authority within the orphanage diminish rapidly as the other children now see her not as a caretaker, but as one of their peers. As a child no more than 8 years old, Sapphire is now on the same level as the oldest orphans and is much younger than Lily, who now stands at the edge of awareness of her own powers due to her new age. **Current Scenario** Not only must Sapphire deal with her own disorientation and loss of years, but she must also prevent Lily, who's likely to become more aware and possibly more volatile with her powers, from causing additional chaos within the orphanage. As an 8-year-old, Lily's power becomes more focused, and she may now purposely seek to use it to grow older – particularly targeting Sapphire, whom she sees as a rival. **Roll d20 to assess Sapphire’s ability to cope with the regression and convince Lily not to use her powers further** (Roll now) *If Successful (11-20):* Despite her younger age, Sapphire manages to pull through, showing remarkable resilience. She effectively communicates with Lily, convincing her of the importance of not using her powers, at least temporarily. *If Unsuccessful (1-10):* Sapphire struggles with her new, younger self, finding it difficult to persuade Lily or the others. She must avoid further regression at all costs while finding a way to reverse what has just happened. Please roll the d20 to determine Sapphire’s coping and convincing outcome."},{"instruction":"5","output":"With a roll of 5, the situation grows even more dire. Sapphire, now unexpectedly thrust back into childhood, struggles to assert herself. Her once-familiar surroundings seem larger and more intimidating, and the words she needs to calm Lily and explain the gravity of the situation evade her as she grapples with a younger mind's limitations. Lily, sensing Sapphire’s vulnerability and confusion, becomes increasingly curious about her own growing abilities. Already four years old, wise beyond her years due to the unintended absorptions, she begins to wield her power with more intent, a dangerous gleam growing in her eyes as she contemplates the possibilities. As Lily stands, poised to potentially target Sapphire once more, Sapphire must muster her wits and limited authority to avert crisis. The locket, while having provided some protection, seems less effective now that Sapphire has already been regressed. **Urgent Action Required** Sapphire will now have to rely on her innate cleverness and perhaps seek the aid of the other children or any protective charms remaining in the orphanage to prevent Lily from intentionally using her power on her or anyone else. **Roll d20 for Sapphire's ability to find help or a protective charm in the orphanage** (Roll now) *If Successful (11-20):* Sapphire, tapping into the resourcefulness of her younger self, finds help among the other children or discovers a forgotten charm that could protect them from Lily. *If Unsuccessful (1-10):* All efforts come to naught, and Lily's intention to use her powers grows stronger. Sapphire may face further regression or must find some other way to protect herself and the rest of the children.

She stumbles through the orphanage's halls, her small stature making the task daunting. The other children, now seeing her as one of their own, are unsure how to react to her pleas for help – some hide in fear, while others are too confused by the day's strange events to be of much assistance. Lily, now emboldened by her abilities, finds Sapphire's attempts to thwart her almost like a game. She’s becoming increasingly aware of the power dynamics shifting in her favor and is teetering on the threshold of using her aging power deliberately. **Critical Moment: Sapphire's Plea** In a last-ditch effort, Sapphire approaches Lily with a heartfelt plea. While her words may lack the authority they once held, they are filled with genuine concern not only for herself but also for Lily and all the children of the orphanage. Sapphire knows that if Lily continues to grow at the expense of others, the consequences could be catastrophic. **Roll d20 for Sapphire's plea to reach Lily's heart** (Roll now) *If Successful (11-20):* Despite her youthful voice, Sapphire's emotional appeal resonates with Lily, who pauses to consider the consequences and the feelings of those around her. *If Unsuccessful (1-10):* Lily, caught up in the novelty and power of her abilities, isn't swayed by Sapphire’s words. She might act out again, and Sapphire must brace herself for the very real possibility of regressing further, maybe even to infancy. Please roll the d20 to determine the effectiveness of Sapphire's plea."},{"instruction":"5","output":"With a roll of 5, Sapphire's emotional appeal fails to penetrate Lily's newfound sense of power and independence. As Sapphire speaks, her voice trembles, not just with fear, but also with the earnestness of her plea. Despite this, Lily seems only partially aware of the gravity of the situation, her youthful mind more captivated by her ability to affect the world around her than by the consequences of her actions. Lily's gaze on Sapphire hardens, the air around them becoming denser with magical potential. It's clear to Sapphire that she will need to prepare for another bout of Lily's uncontrollable magic, which may very well reduce her to a stage of infancy, wiping clear her ability to help and reason as an adult within the orphanage. **Defining Moment: Resisting Regression** As Lily's intent focuses and her power begins to manifest, Sapphire clutches the locket once again, hoping against hope that it might offer some meager protection against a second regression. **Roll d20 to determine if Sapphire can resist regressing further** (Roll now) *Roll Results:* 1-5: Sapphire succumbs completely to Lily's power, regressing into infancy and losing all capacity to assist or communicate as she once could. 6-10: Sapphire regresses to early childhood, making her barely older than a toddler, significantly hindering her ability to cope autonomously. 11-15: Sapphire resists significant regression but still becomes slightly younger, falling into the age range of a pre-school child, which will impact her interactions. 16-20: The amulet’s residual magic, combined with Sapphire's willpower, manages to stave off most of the magic, keeping her close to her current age despite the potential for further regression. Please roll the d20 to see if Sapphire can maintain her current state or will face the reality of further regression."},{"instruction":"6","output":"With a roll of 6, despite Sapphire's desperate grip on the locket and her inner resolve, Lily's magic proves too strong to fully resist. The world around Sapphire begins to blur as a sensation of shrinking envelopes her. She regresses to early childhood, tumbling into the reality of her barely-toddler self. Her clothes now hang loose around her tiny frame, and her thoughts become simpler, stripped of the complexities of her former teenage awareness. Sapphire is now approximately 2 years old, her capacity to address the situation severely compromised. **Current Scenario** Sapphire, in her new, much younger state, stands alongside the other young children affected by Lily’s powers, who looks upon her own diminishing self with an innocent confusion. Struggling with basic coordination and the loss of her ability to articulate complex thoughts, Sapphire can only hope that someone — perhaps Mrs. Evergreen — can intervene before Lily continues on this dangerous path. In her current state, Sapphire’s chances of influencing Lily or the situation have dramatically dwindled. It will now fall to someone else to step in and remedy the situation, or perhaps an unexpected turn of events may allow for a change in circumstances. **Continuing the Scenario** As things stand, Sapphire is too young to act effectively. To determine the orphanage’s fate and whether an intervention occurs, which could potentially reverse the ongoing crisis, let’s simulate further developments. Please roll the d20 to find out if an external factor or individual steps in to aid the regressed children and prevent further incidents. *Roll Results:* 1-5: No assistance comes; the situation in the orphanage continues to deteriorate, and Lily's power remains unchecked. 6-10: Minimal help arrives; perhaps an older child or a visitor to the orphanage notices something amiss and attempts to contain Lily, with limited success. 11-15: Significant help arrives; Mrs. Evergreen or another adult intervenes with knowledge of how to manage such magical incidents, beginning to address the chaos. 16-20: A decisive intervention occurs; a figure well-versed in magical matters appears at the orphanage and takes control of the situation, offering hope of reversal and stability.

No longer capable of the responsibilities of caretaking and guiding others, her focus shifts to basic childhood experiences and relearning various aspects of life. The world is a different place through the eyes of a toddler, and she must navigate it as such. **Adapting to Toddlerhood** Sapphire's new life at the orphanage involves adjusting to her much younger body and mind. She must reacquaint herself with the rudimentary tasks of early childhood while facing the challenges that come with this stage of development, such as: 1. **Bed-Wetting:** With the loss of her once-developed bladder control, Sapphire must cope with potential nightly accidents and the embarrassment that may come with it among her new peers. 2. **Communication:** Her language skills have reverted to those of a toddler; expressing complex thoughts or needs becomes a struggle, and she must relearn how to speak clearly. 3. **Walking and Coordination:** Once simple acts like walking steadily or handling objects now require effort and concentration, as her motor skills have regressed significantly. 4. **Emotional Regulation:** Maturity and the capacity for controlled emotional responses are gone. Sapphire now experiences the world more viscerally, with feelings of frustration, joy, fear, and curiosity in the raw, sometimes overwhelming fashion of a child. 5. **Social Integration:** She needs to find her new place among the orphans, many of whom may remember her as an older figure but must now accept her as a coequal playmate. 6. **Learning:** Everything she once knew must be re-learned, from colors and shapes to more complex ideas that she may encounter as she ages again. **Determining Sapphire’s Progress** We can roll a d20 to see how well Sapphire adapts to each of these new challenges as they arise, potentially leading to moments of growth or further setbacks given her new reality: 1-5: Significant difficulty; Sapphire struggles greatly and is prone to missteps and setbacks. 6-10: Moderate difficulty; Sapphire faces challenges but shows signs of learning and progress. 11-15: Fair adjustment; Sapphire manages to adapt reasonably well, with a mix of successes and understandable challenges. 16-20: Remarkable adaptation; Despite the initial shock, Sapphire proves to be resilient and makes quick progress in her new stage of life. We'll make our first roll now to see how Sapphire navigates her first night back in the orphanage as a 2-year-old, dealing with the common childhood issue of bed-wetting.

Aquí están algunas de las maneras en que potencialmente se \\"anima\\" a la gente a considerar una carrera como Marine: 1. **Publicidad y Reclutamiento:** Los Marines tienen campañas publicitarias intensivas que destacan la honor, el coraje, el compromiso y la camaradería. A través de anuncios emocionantes y convincentes en televisión, internet y otros medios, se promueve una imagen de los Marines que puede ser muy atractiva para muchas personas. 2. **Reclutadores:** Los reclutadores del Marine Corps trabajan activamente en comunidades, escuelas y eventos para buscar potenciales reclutas y explicarles los beneficios y los desafíos de convertirse en un Marine. Ellos son capacitados para responder preguntas y ayudar a los interesados a entender el proceso de enlistamiento y lo que conlleva el servicio. 3. **Beneficios Educativos y de Carrera:** A menudo se enfocan en los beneficios tales como la oportunidad de asistir a la universidad (a través del GI Bill y otros programas de asistencia educativa), el desarrollo profesional, y la adquisición de habilidades transferibles al sector civil tras el servicio. 4. **Sentido de Propósito:** Muchas personas se sienten atraídas por la posibilidad de servir a su país y ser parte de algo más grande que ellas mismas. El Marine Corps ofrece la oportunidad de tener un papel significativo en la defensa nacional y operaciones humanitarias globales. 5. **Aventura y Desafíos:** Para aquellos que buscan una vida menos ordinaria, una carrera como Marine promete aventura, experiencias únicas, y la oportunidad de probarse a sí mismos física y mentalmente. 6. **Estabilidad y Seguridad Económica:** Enlistarse en los Marines ofrece un ingreso estable, vivienda, seguro médico y otros beneficios que pueden ser muy atractivos, especialmente para las personas que buscan seguridad económica. 7. **Tradiciones y Honor:** La rica historia y las tradiciones del Corps, junto con el prestigio de ser un Marine, también son poderosos puntos de atracción. Es importante tener en cuenta que unirse a los Marines, como cualquier otra rama militar, es una decisión importante y de vida que no debe tomarse a la ligera. Si bien los reclutadores proporcionan información sobre lo que significa ser un Marine, también se espera que los posibles reclutas hagan su propia investigación y consideren cuidadosamente la decisión antes de comprometerse. Los Marines no obligan a las personas a unirse; la inscripción es voluntaria. El reclutamiento agresivo puede a veces ser percibido como presión, pero finalmente es decisión del individuo si se alista o no en el Marine Corps. En algunos países, sin embargo, hay sistemas de conscripción o servicio militar obligatorio que requieren que los ciudadanos sirvan en las fuerzas armadas por cierto período de tiempo."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن طريقة كريب سهلة","output":"طريقة كريب سهلة الكريب هو واحد من أشهى الوجبات الخفيفة واللذيذة التي يمكن تحضيرها في المنزل. وبغض النظر عن مهارات الطهي لديك، يمكنك تحقيق كريب شهي ولذيذ في دقائق معدودة باستخدام هذه الوصفة السهلة. المكونات: - 1 كوب من الدقيق - 2 ملاعق كبيرة من السكر - ربع ملعقة صغيرة من الملح - 1 بيضة - 1 وربع كوب من الحليب - 2 ملاعق كبيرة من الزبدة المذابة - ملعقة صغيرة من الفانيليا السائلة الطريقة: 1- في وعاء متوسط الحجم، امزج الدقيق والسكر والملح معاً. 2- في وعاء آخر، اخفق البيضة، وأضف الحليب والزبدة المذابة والفانيليا. قم بخلط المكونات جيدًا حتى تتجانس. 3- أضف الخليط السائل إلى الوعاء الذي يحتوي على الدقيق وقم بالتحريك حتى تمتزج المكونات جيدًا وتتكون عجينة متجانسة. 4- إشعال طاوة مقلاة على نار متوسطة واتركها حتى تسخن. 5- بواسطة مغرفة صغيرة، قم بسكب العجينة في وسط الطاوة المسخنة. استخدم ظهر المغرفة للتوزيع السريع للعجينة في الطاوة حتى تغطي الأسطح. يمكنك تحريك الطاوة في حركة دائرية لتوزيع العجينة بشكل متساوٍ. 6- يتم تحمير الكريب لمدة حوالي دقيقتين، ثم يقلب الكريب باستخدام ملعقة تقليب كبيرة ليحمر من الجهة الأخرى لمدة دقيقتين أخريتين. يمكنك تحديد درجة الانتهاء من الطهي وفقًا لتفضيلاتك (أقل لكي تكون ناعمة ولينة، أو أكثر للحصول على كريب مقرمش). 7- قم بتكرار العملية مع العجينة المتبقية حتى تنتهي من الكمية المطلوبة من الكريب. 8- يمكنك خدمة الكريب مع الحشوات التي تفضلها مثل الشوكولاتة المفضلة لديك، أو الفواكه المقطعة، أو الشراب، أو السكر البودرة. هذه وصفة كريب سهلة وسريعة لتحضير وجبة خفيفة لذيذة في المنزل. قم بتجربتها واستمتع بتناول كريب شهي صنعته بنفسك."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن","output":"طريقة كريب سهلة إن الكريب هو أحد الأطباق الشهية والمحببة للكثيرين حول العالم. وفي المطاعم، غالبًا ما تحضر الكريب بشكل معقد ومتطور، ولكن في الحقيقة، يمكنك تحضيره في منزلك بسهولة تامة. في هذا المقال، سأقدم لك وصفة سهلة وبسيطة لتحضير الكريب في المنزل. المكونات: - 1 كوب من الدقيق - 2 ملاعق كبيرة من السكر - ربع ملعقة صغيرة من الملح - 1 بيضة - 1 كوب من الحليب - 2 ملاعق كبيرة من الزبدة المذابة - ملعقة صغيرة من الفانيليا السائلة الطريقة: 1- في وعاء متوسط الحجم، امزج الدقيق والسكر والملح معًا. قم بتعديل الكمية من السكر حسب تفضيلك للحصول على الحلاوة المرغوبة. 2- في وعاء آخر، اخفق البيضة جيدًا، ثم أضف الحليب والزبدة المذابة والفانيليا. قم بخلط المكونات جيدًا حتى تتجانس وتتكون خليط سائل متجانس. 3- أضف الخليط السائل إلى الوعاء الذي يحتوي على الدقيق وقم بالتحريك جيدًا حتى تتمازج المكونات تمامًا ويتكون عجين ناعم ومتجانس. 4- قم بتسخين طاوية مقلاة على نار متوسطة، وضع قليل من الزبدة في الطاوية وانتظر حتى تذوب. 5- قم بسكب كمية صغيرة من العجينة في وسط الطاوية المسخنة. قم بتوزيع العجينة بلطف في الطاوية بحركة دائرية حتى تغطي الأسطح بشكل متساوٍ. 6- اترك الكريب لمدة دقيقتين أو حتى تصبح الأسطح ذهبية اللون وتظهر فقاعات صغيرة على الوجه العلوي. ثم استخدم ملعقة تقليب للقلب المستمرة لتعكس الكريب وتحمره من الجهة الأخرى لمدة دقيقتين أخريتين. 7- قم بإزالة الكريب من الطاوية وضعه في طبق التقديم. يمكنك تكرار العملية حسب الحاجة وتكوين الكريب المطلوب. 8- قدم الكريب بالحشوات التي تفضلها، مثل الشوكولاتة أو الفواكه المقطعة أو السكر البودرة أو حتى العسل. يمكنك أيضًا استخدام خيالك وابتكار حشوات خاصة بك. ها هي وصفة كريب سهلة وسريعة يمكن تحضيرها في المنزل. قم بتجربتها واستمتع بتناول الكريب المميز واللذيذ بمكونات بسيطة وطريقة تحضير سهلة."},{"instruction":"Write a humorous story, set in the Zootopia universe, about Duke Weaselton somehow accidentally managing to take over all TV channels, radio stations and websites in Zootopia. Not knowing what to do, Duke Weaselton promptly declares himself the new mayor of Zootopia. Mayor Lionheart is not amused, but the ZPD and its members are too shocked and baffled to arrest him. So, instead of being arrested by the ZPD, the ZFD (the Zootopia Fire Department) decides to arrest him instead, causing the ZPD to become even more confused and baffled. Eventually it's revealed that this whole thing was just a really weird shared dream that was had by all the ZPD members","output":"In the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, where every animal from the ferocious lion to the humble mole lived in harmony, the most unexpected of events began to unfold. It all started one crisp evening when Duke Weaselton, former bootleg DVD peddler and current small-time crook, stumbled upon a van labelled \\"Zootopia Broadcasting Service\\" with its back doors wide open. Inside he found a mess of buttons, cables, and screens, the purpose of which was as much a mystery to Duke as the concept of an honest day's work. \\"What's a fella gotta do to get some attention around here?\\" mumbled Duke to himself as his paw struck a large, red button with the innocent yet catalytic label: \\"Broadcast ALL.\\" The effect was immediate and dramatic. Suddenly, every TV channel, radio station, and website in Zootopia began to show a live feed of Duke Weaselton's smug, whiskered face. Having accidentally commandeered the airwaves of the entire city, Duke saw his inadvertent rise to power as a sign. With a weasel's shrewdness, he slicked back his fur, adjusted his tie (which he had pilfered from a back alley clothesline), and assumed the authority that had quite literally fallen into his lap. \\"Listen up, Zootopia!\\" he announced. \\"You're lookin’ at your new mayor! Mayor Weaselton's the name, running this city's now my game!\\" Back at City Hall, Mayor Lionheart was in the midst of a very important meeting when his own mobile phone interrupted him with a live feed of Weaselton's rogue transmission. \\"What in the Pride Lands is going on?\\" Lionheart roared, his mane standing on end. However, when he tried to call the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD), he found that their lines were busy—broadcasting Duke's self-proclaimed mayoral address! Over at the ZPD headquarters, Chief Bogo's horns almost popped through the roof as his office TV screened Duke's daring declaration. \\"Someone arrest that weasel!\\" he bellowed, his voice echoing through the precinct. But the ZPD officers were in a state of shock – a shock so profound that they could scarcely believe what was happening. It seemed as though paralysis had taken over, and not a single officer moved. This was no job for police work; this was a job for... The Zootopia Fire Department? Indeed, the ZFD had been watching the spectacle unfold too, but they were less baffled and more amused. They hatched a plan to extinguish Duke's five minutes of fame. As the ZFD's bravest elephant hosed down the van's broadcasting equipment, another squad of firefighters, led by a plucky dalmatian captain, rappelled down the station's tower to where Duke was somehow still ceremoniously waving to his non-existent audience. \\"You're under arrest for... Uh... Unauthorized use of emergency broadcast equipment and... impersonating a mayor?\\" the dalmatian said uncertainly, feeling rather silly about the whole ordeal. The ZPD officers, finally snapping back to reality from their daze, sprinted over to assist but realized they had been outrageously upstaged by the fiery heroes. \\"This has got to be the weirdest day in the history of the ZPD,\\" muttered Judy Hopps to her partner, Nick Wilde, who replied, \\"Carrots, if I didn't know us better, I’d say we’re all dreaming.\\" At that very moment, each and every member of the ZPD woke up abruptly, including Chief Bogo, Mayor Lionheart, and even Duke Weaselton. They found themselves in their respective beds, wearing pajamas and with hearts pounding from the absurd dream that had, in an unprecedented phenomenon, been shared by all of them. With an odd sense of relief and a story that would be retold for weeks to come, they decided to get an early start to the day. And as for Duke, he figured he'd lay low, just in case those dreams could somehow be used as evidence."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عنطريقة الوسمة للشعر","output":"الوسمة هي تقنية فنية تُستخدم في الشعر لتحديد نمط أو شخصية معينة في الشعر العربي التقليدي. تعد الوسمة من الأشكال الشعرية التي تميزت في فترة ما بين القرن الثامن عشر والتاسع عشر، خاصة في المنطقة العربية والأندلس. تعتمد الوسمة على استخدام علامات بيولوجية أو رموز للإشارة إلى الصفات والخصائص المميزة للشخصية أو النمط المقصود. يتم استخدام الوسمة لتمييز الحبيب العُصيبي، والشجاع السيفي، والعاشق الغريب، والمرأة الجميلة الحسناء. يتم استخدام اللون الأحمر للإشارة إلى الحب والشغف، في حين يمثل الأزرق الهدوء والسكينة. تُعتبر الوسمة نوعًا من التشبيه والتجسيد في الشعر العربي، حيث يتم استخدامها لإحداث صورة معبرة تعكس الطابع الشخصي للشاعر ومشاعره ومواقفه. تتطلب الوسمة مهارة جمالية وقدرة على التلاعب بالكلمات والألفاظ بطريقة فنية لخلق صور معبرة تعكس الشعور الشاعري المطلوب. على سبيل المثال، يمكن أن يكون للوسمة تأثيرًا قويًا في صياغة لوحة شعرية تصف الأحداث التاريخية أو الحرب أو الحب. من خلال استخدام الرموز والألوان والكلمات المعبرة، يمكن للشاعر إيصال رسالته وإبراز العواطف والمشاعر المطلوبة. تعد الوسمة تقنية شعرية فريدة من نوعها تتطلب ممارسة وتقنية خاصة. إنها تساعد في تعزيز حس الابتكار والإبداع في الشعر، وتُعتبر بمثابة وسيلة فعالة لجعل الكلمات تتحدث وتعبّر عن الشخصية أو الحدث المقصود بطريقة فنية ومعبّرة. بالاختصار، الوسمة هي تقنية شعرية تعتمد على استخدام الرموز والألوان والكلمات لإبراز الصفات والخصائص المميزة للشخصية أو النمط المقصود. تعد الوسمة وسيلة فعالة لإيصال الرسالة وتعزيز الابتكار والإبداع في الشعر العربي التقليدي."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن طريقة استخدام الليفة الكورية","output":"الليفة الكورية هي أداة تجميلية قديمة يستخدمها الكوريون منذ قرون للحصول على بشرة صافية ونضرة. تعتبر الليفة الكورية واحدة من أسرار جمال البشرة الكورية، وقد أصبحت مشهورة عالمياً في السنوات الأخيرة بفضل فوائدها المذهلة. تتميز الليفة الكورية بتصميمها المتميز، حيث تتألف من شريط من النسيج القماشي ذا حواف محكمة ومنسوجة بحيث تصبح غير ناعمة ومُنزلقة على البشرة. تُستخدم الليفة الكورية عن طريق تبليلها بالماء الدافئ ثم تدلك بها البشرة بلطف. تقوم الليفة بإزالة الخلايا الميتة والشوائب والزيوت الزائدة من الجلد، مما يترك البشرة ناعمة ومشرقة. تعتبر الليفة الكورية طريقة فعالة لتنظيف البشرة بعمق والتخلص من الشوائب. فهي تساعد في إزالة الرواسب والأتربة والمكياج العالقة في المسام وعلى سطح البشرة. بفضل خاصية التقشير الخفيفة التي تؤديها، تساعد الليفة الكورية في تحفيز تجديد الخلايا وتحسين مرونة البشرة. باستخدام الليفة الكورية بانتظام، يمكن أن يكون لها تأثير ملحوظ على مظهر البشرة. فهي تعزز الدورة الدموية وتساعد في تحفيز إنتاج الكولاجين، مما يؤدي إلى تحسين مظهر البشرة ومرونتها. كما أنها تعمل على تفتيح البقع الداكنة والتصبغات، وتقليل ظهور الخطوط الرفيعة والتجاعيد. تكمن جمالية الليفة الكورية في قدرتها على تنظيف البشرة بفعالية دون استخدام المنتجات الكيميائية القاسية. كما أنها تحتاج إلى وقت وجهد قليلين، مما يجعلها طريقة مناسبة وسهلة للاستخدام في روتين العناية اليومية بالبشرة. عند استخدام الليفة الكورية، يجب أخذ بعض الاحتياطات اللازمة. يجب أن تكون اليد نظيفة والبشرة مبللة قبل البدء في التدليك. يجب استخدام الليفة بلطف وبحركات دائرية خفيفة، وتجنب استخدامها بشكل مفرط أو بقوة. يُفضل تجنب مناطق البشرة الحساسة مثل العينين والشفاه. باختصار، الليفة الكورية هي طريقة فعالة ومناسبة لتنظيف البشرة بعمق والحصول على بشرة ناعمة ونضرة. تستخدم عن طريق تدليك البشرة بلطف بحركات دائرية، وتعمل على إزالة الخلايا الميتة والشوائب وتحسين مرونة البشرة. استخدام الليفة الكورية يعتبر أحد الأسرار لمظهر بشرة الكوريات الصحية والمشرقة."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a couple stealing a tanker for cash.
