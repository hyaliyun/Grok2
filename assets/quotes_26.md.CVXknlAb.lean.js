One way to keep a mental list is to use a planner or a note-taking app on your phone. Daily, write down the tasks you need to accomplish, whether it's responding to emails, paying bills, or grocery shopping. This type of list will help you prioritize your time and ensure that you don't forget anything. Another useful activity for killing time is meditation. Taking a few minutes each day to focus on your breath and clear your mind can work wonders for your productivity. It can help you get into a calm and focused state, which will make it easier to focus on the tasks at hand. However, it's also important to balance meditation with real work. Procrastination and lack of focus are the biggest time killers. Tackle the toughest and most time-consuming tasks first, and then move on to the easier ones. For instance, if you have a project that's due in a week, start working on it early, so you don't have to stress about it later. Finally, if you're looking for a way to kill time when you're bored or waiting, consider writing an article on how to kill time. It can be a fun way to get creative while generating useful tips and tricks that others can use too. Plus, it keeps the mind active and engaged with a constructive task.

Reza Khan was a military officer who played a significant role in the history of Iran. He served in the Persian Cossack Brigade and eventually rose through the ranks to become the brigade's commander. In 1921, he led a coup against the government and established the Pahlavi dynasty, becoming the country's new prime minister. On the other hand, the Russians seized Tehran in 1941 during World War II. The Soviet Union launched an invasion of Iran, and its troops marched into the capital city of Tehran, deposing the Iranian monarch Reza Shah Pahlavi in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. While the dates of these events may seem close, they occurred two decades apart. Reza Khan's promotion occurred in 1921, while the Russian seizure of Tehran happened in 1941.

Between the years 2010 and 2020, the number of people in this age range has increased significantly, with countries such as the United States, Japan, and China reporting a notable surge in their populations.

This news comes not as a surprise, as some City analysts had already voiced their concerns about the opposition party's policy. Labour's plans to raise the minimum wage to £10 per hour and introduce a four-day workweek could potentially hurt businesses that are already struggling to keep their prices competitive. Such policies could lead to increased production costs and reduced profits for companies across various sectors. In the face of these proposed changes, firms are worried that they may have no choice but to continue with cut prices, which could create downward pressure on wages and living standards. While Labour's intentions may be to improve working conditions and boost the economy, there are fears that their policies could have unintended consequences. Moreover, some analysts have warned that this strategy could backfire on Labour itself, as it may alienate businesses and hurt job creation. In a time when the UK is facing economic uncertainties, it is essential for policymakers to strike a balance between improving working conditions and supporting businesses' growth. In conclusion, Labour's policy proposals are aiming to make a significant impact on the UK workforce.

The demonstrations have included burning of documents and rock throwing, sparking concerns about public safety. The government is currently in negotiations with the officers to address their concerns, but tensions remain high. The police officers argue that their salaries and benefits are not sufficient to cover the cost of living, and that they deserve better compensation for their difficult and often dangerous work. The protests have caused disruption throughout the country, with some officers refusing to work and others taking to the streets to voice their grievances. The burning of documents has also raised fears of potential security breaches, as sensitive information may have been lost or damaged. Despite the unrest, leaders on both sides have expressed a willingness to find a resolution. The government has pledged to address the officers' concerns, and talks are ongoing to find a solution that will satisfy all parties involved.

Without this information, we cannot accurately calculate the percentage. Assuming that we have the total population or sample size and data on age, we can calculate the percentage that falls outside of the 45 to 64 age range. To do this, we would need to subtract the number of individuals who fall within the 45 to 64 age range from the total population or sample size. Then, we would divide this number by the total population or sample size and multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage that is not from 45 to 64. For example, if we have a total population of 100 and 30 individuals fall within the 45 to 64 age range, then we would subtract 30 from 100 to get 70 individuals who are not from 45 to 64.

In a game against the Chicago Bears in 2011, he ran a touchdown for just one yard, making it the shortest touchdown run in NFL history.

However, Kuhn holds the distinction of the shortest touchdown run in history, and his feat is still remembered and celebrated by Packers fans. While one-yard runs may seem insignificant compared to longer touchdown runs that require more effort and skill, they play an important role in football. They are often the result of a team's hard work in moving the ball down the field and setting up a scoring opportunity.

After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.a[›] To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, betterunderstandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely (its group representations), both from a theoretical and a computational point of view. A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups announced in 1983.aa[›] Since the mid1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become a particularly active area in group theory.

In the 16th century some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were of Roman extraction, and the Lithuanian language was just a morphed Latin language. This led to paradox: Polish nobility claimed own ancestry from Sarmatian tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies to Romans. Thus new RomanSarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led that in the 16th century the new term to name Lithuanian nobility appeared šlėkta—a direct loanword from Polish szlachta. From the view of historical truth Lithuanians also should use this term, šlėkta (szlachta), to name own nobility, but Lithuanian linguists forbade the usage of this Polish loanword.

He charged £140 a time to marry EU nationals with spouses who were usually Nigerian. Jetted around the world using the undeclared income. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Reverend Brian Shipsides, a former vicar at All Saints church in Forest Gate, East London, has been found to have conducted hundreds of sham marriages between 2007 and 2010. He reportedly charged £140 per ceremony, where EU nationals were married to Nigerian spouses, despite knowing that the marriages were fraudulent. The proceeds from the sham weddings were undeclared by Shipsides and he used the money to travel around the world. The discovery of the bogus unions was made by the UK Border Agency, which had grown suspicious of the unusually high number of marriages conducted at the church. An investigation ensued, revealing the extent of the vicar's involvement in the scam. In total, it is believed that Shipsides conducted over 300 fake marriages during his time at All Saints church. The illegal business was a lucrative one for the vicar, as he was able to charge a fee for each ceremony conducted. His customers were typically EU nationals who wanted to marry Nigerian partners in order to secure the latter's right to remain in the UK. Shipsides knew that the marriages were fraudulent but continued to conduct them anyway, for personal gain. The revelations have shocked the local community, who had trusted Shipsides to act with honesty and integrity. The church has issued a statement distancing itself from the former vicar's actions, stating that it had no knowledge of the sham marriages taking place. Shipsides has since been convicted of immigration offences and was sentenced to five years in prison. The case highlights the extent to which some individuals are willing to go to profit from other people's desperation. It is a reminder of the importance of upholding the law and investigating suspicious activities, in order to safeguard the integrity of our institutions and protect the vulnerable."},{"instruction":"What would be an example of an positive review?","output":"\\"Great product!

ADA is an ingredient that is commonly added to foods to enhance the texture and volume of the product. However, ADA is banned in the UK, most European countries, and Australia due to its potential health hazards. Last month, sandwich chain Subway announced that they would no longer be using the ingredient in their U.S. stores. This decision came after numerous consumer groups have been pushing for the elimination of ADA in food products due to its association with respiratory problems and skin irritations. In large quantities, ADA has been shown to cause harmful effects on the body. Workers who have come in contact with the chemical have reported respiratory problems and skin irritations. Although most consumers are not exposed to the chemical in large amounts, there is still concern over the long-term effects of consuming ADA in small doses over a period of time. Despite the potential risks, it is still legal to use ADA in the United States. Consumer groups are urging the government to take a stand and ban the use of this harmful ingredient in food products. Substitutes for ADA do exist, and many companies have already begun to phase out its use in their products. In conclusion, the use of ADA in food products is a cause for concern among consumers and consumer groups. While it is banned in many countries, it is still allowed in the United States. The recent decision by Subway to eliminate this ingredient in their sandwiches is a step in the right direction, and it is hoped that other companies will follow suit. The potential health risks associated with ADA make it imperative that we find safer alternatives for use in our food products."},{"instruction":"Q: What is the world 's best selling cookie ?

Also, be sure that any family members, including younger siblings, give the teenager the quiet time that they need. Reward their homework with a fun activity or something new their mind enjoys at the moment. You don't want them to feel absorbed in the homework. This will be where their assignments will be done so they can concentrate and have distraction free time. Ultimately, it doesn't matter what their room is or where they sleep. Close any drawers and bookcases, and make sure their possessions are easy to access.

The law, known as the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, was named after a young girl who lost her life after being trapped in a hot tub drain. Despite the importance of the law, some states are having difficulty enforcing it. A number of pool operators have reported that they are still waiting to receive the necessary drain covers, as they are currently on back order. As a result, several states have allowed pools to remain open without implementing the new safety measures. However, many experts have expressed concern that this could put children at risk of serious injury or death. While the federal law is intended to protect children, some states argue that they do not have the legal authority to enforce it. This has created confusion and inconsistency in terms of how the law is being implemented across the country. Despite these challenges, many pool operators are taking the new requirements seriously and are working to ensure that they are in compliance with the law as quickly as possible. In addition to installing the required drain covers, many pools are also taking other steps to improve safety, such as providing additional lifeguards and increasing staff training on emergency procedures. While the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act represents an important step forward in protecting children, it is clear that there are still some challenges that need to be addressed.

In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are suppressed is languagespecific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan (Stampe's wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan. The principles of natural phonology were extended to morphology by Wolfgang U. Dressler, who founded natural morphology.","output":"Title: Natural phonology and its principles."},{"instruction":"w does the next paragraph end?

In order to do that, you need to follow some simple steps to ensure that the wound is treated properly. Here's what to do: First, remove all the bandages from their packaging.

Clean the area and ensure it has enough light to easily see what you're doing. Now that you're all set up, prepare some cotton wool sausages. These will be used to clean the wound and keep it dry. Pre-cut strips of adhesive dressing tape that you will need to cover the wound once it has been cleaned and disinfected. With everything ready, ask someone to help you hold the cat, as treating a cat's injury alone can be quite challenging. While you hold your cat, place it on the table and restrain it properly to prevent any further movement. Your cat's injury may be covered with hair or debris, so it's important to clean the area first with your cotton wool sausages.

With these simple steps, you can treat your cat's injury effectively, ensuring a speedy recovery.

Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect: lighting, film speed, fnumber (aperture size), and shutter speed (exposure time). The equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, by addition, using the APEX system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure; this increment is commonly known as a stop. The effective fnumber is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. Thus, a lens set to f/1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2. Therefore, each fnumber factor of the square root of two (approximately 1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression: f/1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc. Please answer a question about this article.

This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada. Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of Dada and Surrealism was profound; Louis Aragon, founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was our immediate elder, the exemplary poet. Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets John Ashbery and Ron Padgett have recently produced new translations of Reverdy's work.

But faking an illness isn't as simple as it seems. If you want to pull it off convincingly, you need to know how to fake the right symptoms. Here's a guide on how to do just that. Firstly, have controllable symptoms. Don't go for anything too severe, like coughing up blood or passing out. Instead, aim for symptoms you can easily fake, like a sore throat, headache, or upset stomach. Next, play up your symptoms without being too obvious. Avoid talking to show how much your throat hurts. Swallow slowly and show your pain. Be tired, sluggish, and sad. These symptoms are easy to fake and will make you appear genuinely unwell. Gargling with salt water is an effective way to make your throat appear sore. It's a simple but effective trick that can add to the authenticity of your illness. Be careful not to overdo it with symptoms, as this will draw suspicion. Don't act like you're dying, just act like you're under the weather. It's also important to avoid heavy foods and eat lightly, as sickness often leads to a lack of appetite. Lastly, if you really want to sell your illness, have a bit of a fever. This can be easily faked by putting a wet cloth on your forehead. In conclusion, if you need an excuse to stay home, faking an illness can be a viable option. Remember to have controllable symptoms, avoid talking about your commitments, play up your symptoms without being too obvious, and gargle with salt water.

Van Persie and Rooney formed a formidable partnership at Manchester United, scoring important goals for the Red Devils. Van Persie testifies that playing alongside Rooney made him a better player. They both have a unique ability to play as both a striker and an attacking midfielder or 'number 10', making them difficult for defenders to mark. Van Persie had similar sentiments towards Rooney and their partnership, saying that they both make each other better players. They showed their quality in the 2012/13 season, where they scored a combined 38 goals in the Premier League to help Manchester United win the title. Van Persie also spoke about how some advice from Van Basten changed his life. The former Holland manager told him to focus on his strengths rather than trying to fix his weaknesses. This simple advice helped Van Persie evolve into one of the best strikers in the world and score some stunning goals. Finally, Van Persie admitted that he wished he had scored Patrick Kluivert's winner in the 1995 Champions League final. Although he wasn't involved in the match, he still thinks about the missed opportunity to score the winning goal in such a prestigious event. In conclusion, Robin van Persie reflects on his successful partnership with Wayne Rooney, how some advice from Marco van Basten changed his life, and his one regret in football. Van Persie's comments show how important it is to have a good partner on the field, and how simple advice can change a player's career."},{"instruction":"CocaColaandPepsibeenClaimedthatContainedCarcinogen|ChemicalPlastic What's a sentence that uses these characters?","output":"\\"Coca-Cola and Pepsi faces controversy as reports claim the presence of carcinogen and chemical plastic in their products.\\""},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Finn: Hey did you get the notes from class today?

He broke his nose, fractured his eye socket and needed stitches. He was not wearing a helmet but has been told it would not have saved him. He is now claiming compensation from Surrey County Council.","output":"Tony Webber, a 25-year-old cyclist, recently suffered a serious accident when he was flipped over his handlebars after hitting a pothole. The incident left him with a broken nose, fractured eye socket, and multiple stitches. While Webber was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, he has been informed that it would not have significantly lessened his injuries. The accident has since prompted Webber to file a compensation claim against Surrey County Council. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the danger that potholes and other road hazards can pose to cyclists and motorists alike. In recent years, the UK has seen an increasing number of potholes and road hazards, which pose a significant risk to road users. While local councils are responsible for maintaining and repairing the roads in their jurisdiction, the sheer volume of reports and repairs needed often result in delays and backlog. This, in turn, can lead to dangerous road conditions that put lives at risk. Cyclists, in particular, are often vulnerable to accidents caused by potholes and other hazards. With little protection other than a helmet, riders are at risk of sustaining serious or even fatal injuries if they are thrown from their bicycles. While it is essential for cyclists to wear helmets and other protective gear, it is also necessary to address the root causes of these types of accidents. The government and local councils must invest in road maintenance and repair to ensure that the roads are safe for all users. Additionally, drivers and cyclists alike must be vigilant and aware of their surroundings, so they can take appropriate action to avoid accidents caused by road hazards. In conclusion, Webber's accident serves as a sobering reminder of the risks posed by potholes and other road hazards. It is essential to take a proactive approach to road safety by investing in maintenance and repair, increasing awareness and vigilance among drivers and cyclists, and enforcing the legal responsibility of local councils to maintain safe roads. Only by taking these steps can we ensure that everyone can travel safely on our roads."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 5*m 7*m 10 = 0 for m.","output":"The solution for the math problem is m = 2."},{"instruction":"Article: In 1980, the Soviet Union, which then ruled his birthplace Bukhara, celebrated the thousandth anniversary of Avicenna's birth by circulating various commemorative stamps with artistic illustrations, and by erecting a bust of Avicenna based on anthropological research by Soviet scholars.[citation needed] Near his birthplace in Qishlak Afshona, some 25 km (16 mi) north of Bukhara, a training college for medical staff has been named for him.[year needed] On the grounds is a museum dedicated to his life, times and work.[citation needed] Question: Besides stamps, what did the Soviet Union also create in Avicenna's honor?","output":"The Soviet Union also created a bust of Avicenna based on anthropological research by Soviet scholars and a training college for medical staff near his birthplace in Qishlak Afshona, which has a museum dedicated to his life, times, and work."},{"instruction":"Premise: um and uh there's a book called Life Extensions i don't know if you've ever heard of it Hypothesis: I know you heard of the book Life Extensions.

It was during this time that Shaun Wright-Phillips, one of the most promising talents of the club, was sold to Chelsea for a whopping £21 million. Interestingly, Pearce has recently claimed that the club was on the verge of bankruptcy during his time there. It is unclear whether this financial instability played any role in the decision to sell Wright-Phillips, but it certainly would have put pressure on the club's finances. Despite the challenges he faced, Pearce's time at Manchester City taught him the value of the club's academy system. This is exemplified by the development of Micah Richards. Richards, a talented defender who was part of City's academy, went on to have a long and successful career at the club. Today, Pearce is the manager of Nottingham Forest. It is likely that the lessons he learned during his time at Manchester City have informed his approach to managing this club. The value of developing young talent through an academy system cannot be overstated, and it is clear that Pearce understands this better than most."},{"instruction":"w similar are the following two sentences?

The apology was made in 2004 by the then German Development Minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, who explicitly referred to the events as \\"a genocide\\". The genocide occurred between 1904 to 1908, during Germany's colonial rule over Namibia, which was then known as German South West Africa. The Herero and Nama people had resisted the German colonization, and in response, the German military commanders issued orders to exterminate them. As a result, thousands of men, women, and children were killed or forced into concentration camps where many died due to diseases and harsh living conditions. For several decades, the German government avoided acknowledging the killings as genocide, which was considered a sensitive and controversial term. Instead, the massacres were referred to as a \\"colonial-era conflict\\" or even as mere \\"excesses\\" of war. It was only after intense negotiations with the Namibian government, which demanded an official apology and reparations, that the German government agreed to use the term \\"genocide.\\" In May 2021, Germany announced that it would return Namibia's colonial-era artifacts which were looted during the massacres of the Herero and Nama people. The German government also pledged to provide over €1.1 billion in development aid to Namibia over 30 years as a direct acknowledgment of its colonial-era crimes. This gesture was welcomed by the Namibian government and the indigenous communities affected by the genocide, but it also sparked criticism concerning the adequacy and timeliness of the effort. In conclusion, it took more than 100 years for the German government to recognize the massacres of the Herero and Nama people as genocide. While the official apology and reparations are welcome steps towards reconciliation, it is important to acknowledge the enduring impact of colonialism and systemic racism on the affected communities and to work towards genuine justice and healing."},{"instruction":"f Three guys sitting on rocks looking at the scenery., can we conclude Three guys are sitting on a bench.?

Staff members were taught to be on hand to assist customers, but not too aggressively, and to sell the merchandise.

Louis van Gaal made a surprising decision to substitute Paddy McNair after just 39 minutes of play. The 19-year-old defender had struggled early on and seemed to lack confidence in his abilities. Speaking after the match, the Manchester United boss stated that he 'had to' replace McNair, as he wasn't performing up to the required standard. Van Gaal admitted that McNair's lack of confidence was evident, and he felt it was in the player's best interests to bring him off the field. However, the decision to replace McNair was met with surprise and criticism from many fans and pundits. McNair has been a regular in the Manchester United starting lineup this season and has often impressed with his performances. Some saw the substitution as a harsh decision that could potentially harm McNair's confidence even further. Van Gaal remained defiant over his decision, stating that he always acts in the best interests of his players. He believes that taking McNair off was the right move, as it allowed the young defender to regroup and come back stronger in future games. Van Gaal also praised the performance of McNair's replacement, Marcos Rojo, who put in a solid display at left-back.

In this respect it is notable that the Umayyad caliphs referred to themselves not as khalifat rasul Allah (successor of the messenger of God, the title preferred by the tradition), but rather as khalifat Allah (deputy of God). The distinction seems to indicate that the Umayyads regarded themselves as God's representatives at the head of the community and saw no need to share their religious power with, or delegate it to, the emergent class of religious scholars. In fact, it was precisely this class of scholars, based largely in Iraq, that was responsible for collecting and recording the traditions that form the primary source material for the history of the Umayyad period. In reconstructing this history, therefore, it is necessary to rely mainly on sources, such as the histories of Tabari and Baladhuri, that were written in the Abbasid court at Baghdad.

Practice identifying chords by sound. Determine whether the song is in a major or minor key. Identify the tonic (I) chord. Use the bass line as a guide to find other chords.

These progressions are the backbone of music and are essential for any musician or composer to master. By understanding common chord progressions, you can create more nuanced and effective music. The first step to understanding chord progressions is to familiarize yourself with the ones commonly used in your genre. For example, if you are a jazz musician, you will want to start with familiarizing yourself with the ii-V-I chord progression. Similarly, if you are a blues musician, you'll want to get to know the 12 bar blues progression. Once you have familiarized yourself with these progressions, the next step is to practice identifying chords by sound. This skill takes time to develop, but with consistent practice, you can train your ear to recognize different chords based on their sound. Another important step is to determine whether a song is in a major or minor key. Knowing this will help you understand the mood and feeling of the music. In a major key, the I chord will be major, while in a minor key, it will be minor. Identifying the tonic (I) chord is crucial, as this will help you understand the harmonic structure of the song. Once you've identified the tonic, use the bass line as a guide to find other chords. The bass line will generally follow the root notes of each chord in the progression. Practice playing the chords in sequence. This will help ingrain the progressions into your muscle memory and make it easier to play them without thinking. As you become more comfortable with the progressions, try experimenting with variations to make them unique and creative. Ultimately, the goal is to put the chords and melody together. This will involve playing the chords as the melody progresses, highlighting the mood and feeling of the music. In conclusion, mastering chord progressions is essential for any serious musician or composer. By familiarizing yourself with common progressions, identifying chords by sound, determining the key and tonic chord, using the bass line as a guide, and practicing playing chords in sequence, you'll be well on your way to creating effective and memorable music."},{"instruction":"Question: Which school granted Lee an honory doctorate in 2006?
