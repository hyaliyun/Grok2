The classification as a Springian planet suggests it falls within a temperature range of 90-350 K, which is relatively cold compared to planets closer to their stars. This temperature range emphasizes a chemical composition rich in organic compounds and sulfur, hinting at intriguing atmospheric phenomena and potentially vibrant aerial ecosystems. # Gray Ring The presence of a gray ring resulting from a rocky planet that came too close and was destroyed by Lṫeko̍y's Roche limit adds a layer of historical and dynamic complexity to the system. The Roche limit is the distance within which a celestial body, held together only by its gravity, will disintegrate due to a second celestial body's tidal forces exceeding the first body's gravitational self-attraction. This event suggests catastrophic past events that have shaped the current state of Lṫeko̍y and its orbiting bodies. The material composing the ring could be a source of study for understanding the system's geological and astronomical history. # Aerial Lifeforms The mention of aerial lifeforms on Lṫeko̍y is particularly intriguing. Given the planet's gaseous nature and the presumed abundance of organic compounds and sulfur in its atmosphere, these lifeforms would need to have evolved survival strategies significantly different from terrestrial life. Such adaptations could include floating or flying mechanisms, unique respiratory systems to process the planet's chemical composition, and perhaps even social structures that optimize for life suspended in the atmosphere. # Orbital Characteristics Õlk̍ṅ being the second planet orbiting Lṫeko̍y places it in a unique celestial position, possibly affecting its climate, geological activity, and overall environmental conditions due to gravitational interactions with the giant planet and its ring system. The presence of 45 asteroids in orbit around Lṫeko̍y also indicates a complex gravitational field and a dynamic space environment, likely impacting Õlk̍ṅ with meteor showers or by serving as a source of mined materials. # Rocky Planets The system's other rocky planets, listed as the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th orbiting Lṫeko̍y, contribute to the diversity of celestial bodies within this system. Each of these planets would have its own unique conditions, compositions, and potentially even life forms, making the system a rich tapestry of astronomical phenomena and a likely candidate for exploration and study. # The Chromochemical System The chromochemical classification, illustrated by the Springian class to which Lṫeko̍y belongs, provides an innovative approach to categorizing gaseous giants based on temperature, chemical composition, and observable colors. This system not only aids in the identification and study of such planets but also hints at the aesthetic aspects of astronomical objects—offering a glimpse into how these celestial bodies appear when observed. In summary, Lṫeko̍y and its accompanying celestial bodies offer a detailed and captivating glimpse into a system that is both scientifically intriguing and ripe for storytelling within the context of its alien civilization, environmental conditions, and interstellar interactions. The system, with its gaseous giant, destroyed planets, orbital characteristics, and unique life forms, encapsulates the diversity and wonder of the universe, highlighting the myriad possibilities for exploration, settlement, and understanding beyond our Earthly experiences."},{"instruction":"Give Õlk̍ev̇b name for GV2-type parent star of Õlk̍ṅ","output":"Given the linguistic characteristics and naming conventions outlined for the constructed language Õlk̍ev̇b, and without a specific formula provided for naming stars or celestial bodies, a plausible name for the GV2-type parent star of Õlk̍ṅ within the constraints of this language's structure could be synthesized as follows: The prefix \\"Lṫe\\" could signify a celestial or significant astronomical object, as inferred from the naming of the planet's gaseous giant \\"Lṫeko̍y.\\" The suffix \\"k̍ṅ\\" is part of the planet Õlk̍ṅ's name, possibly denoting a categorization or relationship within its celestial system.

Since Õlk̍ev̇b is a constructed language with unique linguistic features, the guidelines should facilitate its use in communication, writing, and cultural expression among the inhabitants of Õlk̍ṅ. Here’s a fundamental approach to structuring these guidelines: # 1. Letters Categories **Begins (Consonants):** Serve as the initial sound of a word or syllable, setting the phonetic foundation. They are crucial for word identity and grammatical function. - **List:** b, o, k, y, d, q, f, v, n, t **Middles (Vowels):** Usually follow a begin consonant, providing vowel sounds that are essential for word formation and variations in meaning. - **List:** i, l, j (Note: In this system, 'l' and 'j' are treated as vowels or vowel-like sounds, reflecting unique aspects of Õlk̍ev̇b phonology.) **Ends:** Conclude a word or syllable, vital for completing the sound structure and often indicating tense, case, plurality, or other grammatical nuances. - **List:** r, ǝ, e # 2. Diacritics Roles Diacritics modify the letters they accompany, altering pronunciation, grammatical function, or semantic content. They can be applied to any category of letters, influencing the word's overall meaning and sound. - **List and Function:** - ̇ : May indicate a tone, stress, or elongation of the associated sound. - ̍ : Could imply a phonetic alteration, such as softening a consonant or modifying a vowel’s quality. - ̆ : Might signal a shortening or reduction of the sound. - ̃ : Potentially denotes nasalization or another significant modification of the original sound for both consonants and vowels. - ̀ , ̑ , ̄ , ̌ , etc.: Each could represent different phonetic variations or grammatical markers, such as case endings, possessive forms, or plurals. # 3. Application Guidelines - **Combination Rule:** A word typically begins with a 'Begin' letter, includes one or more 'Middle' letters, and ends with an 'End' letter. This structure supports clarity and consistency in word formation. - **Diacritics Placement:** Diacritics are placed directly above the letter they modify. The choice of diacritic depends on the desired alteration in sound or meaning. Some diacritics may be specific to certain letters, depending on phonetic compatibility. - **Pronunciation Influence:** The presence of a diacritic might change the pronunciation of a letter significantly. Guidelines for these alterations should be consistent and well-documented to aid learners of the language. - **Semantic and Grammatical Impact:** Beyond phonetic changes, certain diacritics could imply grammatical or semantic shifts important for conveying precise meanings. Their use requires understanding the context and the syntax of Õlk̍ev̇b. # 4. Writing System Written from left to right in horizontal lines, words are separated by spaces.

These guidelines will respect the unique linguistic features of Õlk̍ev̇b as provided. # Overview of Õlk̍ev̇b Characters Structure System **1. Letter Categories in Õlk̍ev̇b** - **Begins:** Initial letters of words; primarily consonants. - **Middles:** Typically vowel sounds that follow a 'begin' and can be combined with 'ends'. - **Ends:** Concluding letters that often indicate grammatical structures. **2. Diacritics Application** Diacritics in Õlk̍ev̇b alter the sound, meaning, or grammatical function of the letters they are applied to. They are especially significant when used with 'begin' letters to convey nuanced phonetic or semantic attributes. # Specific Guidelines for Structured Use **Arrangement of Letters:** - When constructing words, 'begin' letters start the word unless an 'end' letter is used in a specific, rule-based scenario to convey particular meanings or grammatical nuances. - 'Middle' letters follow a 'begin' or modified 'begin' letter and precede an 'end' letter, facilitating the flow and connection of sounds within the word. - 'End' letters can precede 'begin' letters in certain constructed circumstances, transforming traditional roles and creating unique word structures, as shown in the \\"eb\\" example. **Applying Diacritics on \\"b\\":** - When \\"b\\" is used as a 'begin' letter, diacritics can be applied directly to it to modify its pronunciation, introduce tonal qualities, or alter its grammatical function within the word. - The choice of diacritic on \\"b\\" follows specific rules related to the desired output in sound or meaning. For instance, \\"ḃ\\" might indicate a softened pronunciation, a deviation from its normal sound, or a special grammatical category. **Example Formulation: \\"ejḃ\\"** - In the given example, \\"ejḃ\\" combines 'end' \\"e\\", 'middle' \\"j\\", and 'begin' \\"b\\" with a diacritic \\"̇\\". - This structure showcases the flexibility of Õlk̍ev̇b in word formation: - **\\"e\\" (end) at the start:** Indicates a grammatical or semantic reversal or specialty. - **\\"j\\" (middle):** Maintains its role as connecting or enhancing the flow between 'begin' and 'end'. - **\\"ḃ\\" (begin with diacritic):** Alters the expected sound or function of \\"b\\", affected by the diacritic. # Writing System and Diacritics Placement - Õlk̍ev̇b is written left to right, with words separated by spaces. - Diacritics are placed above, below, or around their letters, depending on the defined phonetic or grammatical influence. - Consistency in diacritics' application ensures clarity and aids in learning and understanding of Õlk̍ev̇b's complexities. # Cultural and Evolutionary Considerations - The guidelines for Õlk̍ev̇b's letters and diacritics structure must also allow for cultural significance and evolutionary language changes, accommodating new concepts, technologies, and intercultural exchanges. - Openness to adaptation and reinterpretation of these rules can foster rich linguistic diversity and creativity within Õlk̍ev̇b-speaking communities.

Analysis & Summary of SaaS, PaaS & IaaS Cloud Computing Solutions Software as a Service (SaaS) SaaS is a cloud computing model where software applications are provided over the internet on a subscription basis (Mell & Grance, 2011). Users do not need to worry about software maintenance or infrastructure management, as these are handled by the service provider. A practical example of SaaS is Salesforce, a customer relationship management (CRM) tool used by businesses worldwide. However, SaaS solutions may pose data security concerns, as sensitive information is stored on external servers (Smith, 2022). Platform as a Service (PaaS) PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure (Mell & Grance, 2011). It offers a high level of abstraction, which can increase productivity by reducing the amount of coding required (Johnson, 2023). For instance, Google App Engine is a popular PaaS solution. Despite its benefits, PaaS can lead to vendor lock-in, as it may be challenging to migrate applications to other platforms (Brown, 2023). Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (Mell & Grance, 2011). It offers a high degree of flexibility and control over the infrastructure, making it suitable for businesses with specific requirements. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading IaaS provider. However, managing an IaaS solution requires a certain level of IT expertise, which may be a barrier for some organizations (Davis, 2023). In conclusion, SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS each offer unique advantages and potential challenges.

PaaS can increase productivity by reducing coding requirements, but may lead to vendor lock-in. IaaS offers flexibility and control, but requires IT expertise. Therefore, organizations should carefully consider their specific needs and capabilities when choosing a cloud computing solution. Recommendations & Cost Estimates of Provisioning Services When provisioning cloud services, organizations must consider their specific needs, budget constraints, and long-term goals. For small to medium-sized businesses with limited IT resources, SaaS solutions like Salesforce or Microsoft 365 can be an excellent choice. These services offer a wide range of functionalities at a predictable monthly cost. According to Gartner (2022), the average cost per user for a basic SaaS CRM system is around 50 per month. For organizations looking to develop custom applications, PaaS solutions such as Google App Engine or Microsoft Azure can provide a robust and flexible platform. These services typically charge based on the resources consumed, making them scalable and cost-effective. As per the report by Flexera (2023), the median monthly cost for a PaaS solution ranges from 500 for small applications to 20,000 for large-scale enterprise applications. For large organizations with specific infrastructure requirements, IaaS solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform can offer the necessary control and flexibility. These services typically charge based on the resources used, such as storage, compute power, and network traffic. According to a study by Canalys (2024), the average monthly cost for an IaaS solution can range from 1,000 for small deployments to over 10,000 for large-scale implementations. In conclusion, the choice between SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS depends on the organization’s specific needs, technical capabilities, and budget. It’s crucial to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis before deciding on a cloud service model. Furthermore, organizations should consider engaging with a cloud services broker to help navigate the complex landscape of cloud computing and ensure they are getting the best value for their investment (Columbus, 2023). Recommendations for INaaS and BPaaS Development & Provision The development and provision of Infrastructure Networking as a Service (INaaS) and Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) require careful planning and strategic implementation. INaaS Development & Provision INaaS, an extension of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), provides network components as a service. It includes services like Wide Area Networking (WAN), bandwidth provisioning, and firewall protection (Gartner, 2022). 1. Scalability: INaaS should be scalable to accommodate the fluctuating network demands of businesses. For instance, Amazon Web Services Direct Connect provides dedicated network connections from the user’s premises to AWS, allowing for increased bandwidth throughput (AWS, 2023). 2. Security: Security is paramount in INaaS. Providers should ensure robust security measures, such as advanced firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Cisco’s Secure Firewall, for example, offers threat-focused next-generation firewall security (Cisco, 2024). 3. Cost: INaaS providers should offer flexible pricing models that align with the usage patterns of businesses. Microsoft Azure, for instance, provides a pay-as-you-go model, allowing businesses to pay only for the network resources they use (Microsoft, 2023). BPaaS Development & Provision BPaaS delivers business process outsourcing (BPO) services through the cloud, typically automated, and covers business functions like payroll, human resources, or accounting (IBM, 2022). 1. Integration: BPaaS solutions should seamlessly integrate with existing systems. For example, Workday’s BPaaS solution for human resources and finance can integrate with existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (Workday, 2023). 2. Customization: BPaaS providers should offer customization options to cater to the unique needs of businesses. SAP’s Cloud Platform offers a wide range of customization options for its BPaaS solutions (SAP, 2024). 3. Compliance: Given the sensitive nature of the data handled, BPaaS providers must ensure compliance with relevant regulations. ADP’s BPaaS solution for payroll and human resources, for example, complies with global and local statutory regulations (ADP, 2024). The development and provision of INaaS and BPaaS require a strategic approach that considers scalability, security, cost, integration, customization, and compliance. By following these recommendations, providers can deliver robust and efficient services that meet the diverse needs of businesses. The examples of AWS, Cisco, Microsoft Azure, Workday, SAP, and ADP illustrate the practical application of these recommendations. As the demand for cloud services continues to grow, the importance of these considerations will only increase. Critical Examination of Selected Service Providers’ Green Credentials In the era of climate change, the green credentials of service providers have become a critical consideration. This section critically examines the green credentials of selected service providers. Amazon Web Services (AWS): AWS has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy usage for its global infrastructure by 2025 (AWS, 2024). However, Greenpeace’s “Clicking Clean” report (2023) criticized AWS for its lack of transparency in energy reporting and slow progress towards its renewable energy goals. Microsoft Azure: Microsoft has pledged to be carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050, it aims to remove all the carbon it has emitted since its inception in 1975 (Microsoft, 2023). While these commitments are commendable, the company’s continued investments in fossil fuel technologies present a contradiction (The Guardian, 2023). Google Cloud: Google achieved its goal of matching its energy usage with 100% renewable energy in 2017 (Google, 2022). However, the company has faced criticism for its contracts with oil and gas companies, which arguably undermine its green credentials (The Verge, 2023). IBM Cloud: IBM has committed to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (IBM, 2024). Yet, the company’s specific plans towards this goal remain unclear, raising questions about its green commitment (Business Insider, 2024). While these service providers have made significant commitments towards sustainability, there is a clear need for greater transparency and consistency in their actions. The green credentials of a company are not just about the goals it sets, but also about the integrity it maintains in pursuing those goals. As consumers and businesses increasingly prioritize sustainability, the pressure on these service providers to improve their green credentials will only intensify. Conclusion In conclusion, the green credentials of service providers are a complex interplay of commitments, actions, and transparency. While AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud have made significant strides towards sustainability, their actions sometimes contradict their commitments. For instance, Microsoft’s investment in fossil fuels undermines its carbon-negative pledge. Similarly, Google Cloud’s contracts with oil and gas companies cast a shadow over its achievement of 100% renewable energy. These examples underscore the importance of consistency between a company’s sustainability goals and its actions. As the demand for sustainable services grows, these providers must not only set ambitious goals but also demonstrate unwavering commitment to these goals through their actions. The future of our planet hinges on such commitment to sustainability, making the examination of green credentials not just an academic exercise, but a necessity for our times.

Analysis & Summary of SaaS, PaaS & IaaS Cloud Computing Solutions Software as a Service (SaaS) SaaS is a cloud computing model where software applications are provided over the internet on a subscription basis (Mell & Grance, 2011). Users do not need to worry about software maintenance or infrastructure management, as these are handled by the service provider. A practical example of SaaS is Salesforce, a customer relationship management (CRM) tool used by businesses worldwide. However, SaaS solutions may pose data security concerns, as sensitive information is stored on external servers (Smith, 2022). Platform as a Service (PaaS) PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure (Mell & Grance, 2011). It offers a high level of abstraction, which can increase productivity by reducing the amount of coding required (Johnson, 2023). For instance, Google App Engine is a popular PaaS solution. Despite its benefits, PaaS can lead to vendor lock-in, as it may be challenging to migrate applications to other platforms (Brown, 2023). Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (Mell & Grance, 2011). It offers a high degree of flexibility and control over the infrastructure, making it suitable for businesses with specific requirements. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading IaaS provider. However, managing an IaaS solution requires a certain level of IT expertise, which may be a barrier for some organizations (Davis, 2023). In conclusion, SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS each offer unique advantages and potential challenges. SaaS is user-friendly and eliminates the need for infrastructure management, but may pose data security concerns. PaaS can increase productivity by reducing coding requirements, but may lead to vendor lock-in. IaaS offers flexibility and control, but requires IT expertise. Therefore, organizations should carefully consider their specific needs and capabilities when choosing a cloud computing solution. Recommendations & Cost Estimates of Provisioning Services When provisioning cloud services, organizations must consider their specific needs, budget constraints, and long-term goals. For small to medium-sized businesses with limited IT resources, SaaS solutions like Salesforce or Microsoft 365 can be an excellent choice. These services offer a wide range of functionalities at a predictable monthly cost. According to Gartner (2022), the average cost per user for a basic SaaS CRM system is around 50 per month. For organizations looking to develop custom applications, PaaS solutions such as Google App Engine or Microsoft Azure can provide a robust and flexible platform. These services typically charge based on the resources consumed, making them scalable and cost-effective. As per the report by Flexera (2023), the median monthly cost for a PaaS solution ranges from 500 for small applications to 20,000 for large-scale enterprise applications. For large organizations with specific infrastructure requirements, IaaS solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform can offer the necessary control and flexibility. These services typically charge based on the resources used, such as storage, compute power, and network traffic. According to a study by Canalys (2024), the average monthly cost for an IaaS solution can range from 1,000 for small deployments to over 10,000 for large-scale implementations. In conclusion, the choice between SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS depends on the organization’s specific needs, technical capabilities, and budget. It’s crucial to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis before deciding on a cloud service model. Furthermore, organizations should consider engaging with a cloud services broker to help navigate the complex landscape of cloud computing and ensure they are getting the best value for their investment (Columbus, 2023). Recommendations for INaaS and BPaaS Development & Provision The development and provision of Infrastructure Networking as a Service (INaaS) and Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) require careful planning and strategic implementation. INaaS Development & Provision INaaS, an extension of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), provides network components as a service. It includes services like Wide Area Networking (WAN), bandwidth provisioning, and firewall protection (Gartner, 2022). 1. Scalability: INaaS should be scalable to accommodate the fluctuating network demands of businesses. For instance, Amazon Web Services Direct Connect provides dedicated network connections from the user’s premises to AWS, allowing for increased bandwidth throughput (AWS, 2023). 2. Security: Security is paramount in INaaS. Providers should ensure robust security measures, such as advanced firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Cisco’s Secure Firewall, for example, offers threat-focused next-generation firewall security (Cisco, 2024). 3. Cost: INaaS providers should offer flexible pricing models that align with the usage patterns of businesses. Microsoft Azure, for instance, provides a pay-as-you-go model, allowing businesses to pay only for the network resources they use (Microsoft, 2023). BPaaS Development & Provision BPaaS delivers business process outsourcing (BPO) services through the cloud, typically automated, and covers business functions like payroll, human resources, or accounting (IBM, 2022). 1. Integration: BPaaS solutions should seamlessly integrate with existing systems. For example, Workday’s BPaaS solution for human resources and finance can integrate with existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (Workday, 2023). 2. Customization: BPaaS providers should offer customization options to cater to the unique needs of businesses. SAP’s Cloud Platform offers a wide range of customization options for its BPaaS solutions (SAP, 2024). 3. Compliance: Given the sensitive nature of the data handled, BPaaS providers must ensure compliance with relevant regulations. ADP’s BPaaS solution for payroll and human resources, for example, complies with global and local statutory regulations (ADP, 2024). The development and provision of INaaS and BPaaS require a strategic approach that considers scalability, security, cost, integration, customization, and compliance. By following these recommendations, providers can deliver robust and efficient services that meet the diverse needs of businesses. The examples of AWS, Cisco, Microsoft Azure, Workday, SAP, and ADP illustrate the practical application of these recommendations. As the demand for cloud services continues to grow, the importance of these considerations will only increase. Critical Examination of Selected Service Providers’ Green Credentials In the era of climate change, the green credentials of service providers have become a critical consideration. This section critically examines the green credentials of selected service providers. Amazon Web Services (AWS): AWS has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy usage for its global infrastructure by 2025 (AWS, 2024). However, Greenpeace’s “Clicking Clean” report (2023) criticized AWS for its lack of transparency in energy reporting and slow progress towards its renewable energy goals. Microsoft Azure: Microsoft has pledged to be carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050, it aims to remove all the carbon it has emitted since its inception in 1975 (Microsoft, 2023). While these commitments are commendable, the company’s continued investments in fossil fuel technologies present a contradiction (The Guardian, 2023). Google Cloud: Google achieved its goal of matching its energy usage with 100% renewable energy in 2017 (Google, 2022). However, the company has faced criticism for its contracts with oil and gas companies, which arguably undermine its green credentials (The Verge, 2023). IBM Cloud: IBM has committed to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (IBM, 2024). Yet, the company’s specific plans towards this goal remain unclear, raising questions about its green commitment (Business Insider, 2024). While these service providers have made significant commitments towards sustainability, there is a clear need for greater transparency and consistency in their actions. The green credentials of a company are not just about the goals it sets, but also about the integrity it maintains in pursuing those goals. As consumers and businesses increasingly prioritize sustainability, the pressure on these service providers to improve their green credentials will only intensify. Conclusion In conclusion, the green credentials of service providers are a complex interplay of commitments, actions, and transparency. While AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud have made significant strides towards sustainability, their actions sometimes contradict their commitments. For instance, Microsoft’s investment in fossil fuels undermines its carbon-negative pledge. Similarly, Google Cloud’s contracts with oil and gas companies cast a shadow over its achievement of 100% renewable energy. These examples underscore the importance of consistency between a company’s sustainability goals and its actions. As the demand for sustainable services grows, these providers must not only set ambitious goals but also demonstrate unwavering commitment to these goals through their actions. The future of our planet hinges on such commitment to sustainability, making the examination of green credentials not just an academic exercise, but a necessity for our times.

Drawing from the initial recommendations provided, this section delves deeper into the financial aspects of adopting SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS solutions, referencing Gartner (2022), Flexera (2023), and Canalys (2024) findings, respectively, to provide a comprehensive view. # Cost Analysis of Current IT Infrastructure The current setup, characterized by outdated systems lacking integration, incurs significant costs related not only to maintaining and occasionally patching these systems but also to lost opportunities and inefficiencies. Without specific figures from CVS's finances, industry norms suggest that maintaining legacy systems can cost organizations upwards of 70% of their total IT budget (Smith & Johnson, 2023). Further, non-integrated systems often lead to manual data reconciliation, higher error rates, and missed sales opportunities, particularly impactful for an organization with an e-commerce arm (Brown, 2023). # Financial Implications and Savings with Cloud Computing **SaaS Solutions:** For basic applications such as email and customer relationship management, SaaS offers a predictable cost model. Gartner (2022) estimated the average cost at 50 per user per month for a CRM system. For CVS, transitioning to SaaS for its 4,000 employees could mean an initial monthly outlay of approximately 200,000. However, this shift eliminates the need for upfront software purchases and reduces ongoing maintenance expenses and the need for specialized IT support, presenting long-term savings. **PaaS Solutions:** For developing custom applications, PaaS provides a flexible and scalable environment. With costs based on resource consumption, Flexera (2023) indicates a median monthly cost from 500 to 20,000 for applications of varying scales. Assuming CVS adopts PaaS for medium-scale applications, a mid-range estimate of 10,000 monthly reflects not only the initial outlay but considerable savings in avoiding the capital expenditure on server hardware and data centers. **IaaS Solutions:** Large-scale infrastructure needs, particularly for CVS's e-commerce platform, can be met by IaaS, offering control and scalability. Based on usage, Canalys (2024) suggests costs ranging from 1,000 to over 10,000 monthly for such solutions. By choosing a service like AWS for its e-commerce infrastructure, CVS might face a starting cost near the upper range but would benefit from significant reductions in the investment required for physical servers and the ability to scale resources according to demand, resulting in operational efficiencies and cost control over time. # Long-Term Financial Benefits Adopting cloud computing presents CVS with an opportunity to transform its IT infrastructure into a more scalable, efficient, and agile system. While the upfront monthly costs might seem substantial—potentially reaching upwards of 230,000 when combining SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS solutions—the long-term savings and benefits far outweigh the initial increase in operational expenses. Reductions in capital expenditures, the elimination of maintenance costs for outdated systems, improved operational efficiencies, and the ability to scale resources precisely according to need all contribute to a stronger financial position over time. Additionally, a cloud-based infrastructure aligns with the development of a national e-commerce strategy, potentially increasing revenue and further offsetting the costs associated with the cloud transition (Taylor, 2023). # Conclusion In conclusion, the transition to cloud computing, though initially costlier in terms of operational expenses, presents CVS with an opportunity for significant long-term savings and financial sustainability. The efficiency, scalability, and flexibility provided by cloud solutions like SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS not only support CVS in achieving its operational goals but also align with its strategic initiatives, including expanding its e-commerce presence. A nuanced understanding of these costs and benefits, supported by industry research and projections, is essential for CVS to make informed decisions about its IT infrastructure investment."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Максимальное количество ошибок, допущенных одним студентом на контрольной работе, равно семи. Какое минимальное количество студентов в группе могло совершить одинаковое количество ошибок? (Учитывая студентов, совершивших 0 ошибок)","output":"Чтобы определить минимальное количество студентов, которое могло совершить одинаковое количество ошибок, нужно рассмотреть случай, при котором студенты совершают максимально возможное разнообразие в количестве ошибок. Поскольку максимальное количество ошибок — семь, и есть возможность совершить ноль ошибок, всего существует восемь различных результатов контрольной работы по количеству ошибок (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Так как в группе 25 человек, и имеется только восемь уникальных вариантов количества ошибок, чтобы узнать минимально возможное количество студентов с одинаковым числом ошибок, мы можем предположить, что каждый вариант количества ошибок встречается как минимум трижды (поскольку 3 x 8 = 24), что меньше общего количества студентов в группе. Распределение студентов по группам с одинаковым количеством ошибок в таком случае приведет к тому, что хотя бы одна такая \\"группа ошибок\\" будет содержать больше студентов, чем остальные, из-за оставшегося студента (25 - 24 = 1), который тоже должен быть распределён. Однако, чтобы определить минимальное количество студентов, имеющих одинаковое количество ошибок, нужно учесть, что мы ищем минимально возможный вариант, а не максимальное разнообразие. В описанном выше расчёте, каждая группа ошибок уже содержит минимум трех студентов для максимального разнообразия, но одна группа будет содержать четырех. Таким образом, минимальное количество студентов, которое могло совершить одинаковое количество ошибок, всё же три (учитывая условия задачи и сам подход к решению). Так что, ответ на вопрос зависит от того, как мы его интерпретируем: если ищем минимальное количество студентов, которые точно будут иметь одинаковое количество ошибок при любом распределении, то это будет три студента. Это минимум, при условии что мы стремимся распределить всех студентов по возможности равномерно среди всех возможных результатов."},{"instruction":"Выберите справедливые утверждения для данного отношения на множестве людей: \\"... имеет тот же цвет глаз, что и ...\\" Вопрос 2Выберите один или несколько ответов: Отношение кососимметрично Отношение симметрично Отношение частичного порядка Отношение транзитивно Отношение эквивалентности Отношение рефлексивно","output":"Для отношения \\"... имеет тот же цвет глаз, что и ...\\" анализируем каждое утверждение: 1. **Отношение симметрично** - верно.

Задача, кажется, содержит небольшую опечатку в определении второй функции (g(x)), которая должна быть задана как (g(x) = -5x + 4). # Функция (f(x) = 5x + 3) **Инъективность (взаимно однозначное соответствие):** Функция инъективна, если разным значениям аргумента соответствуют разные значения функции. В случае линейной функции, как (f(x)), это условие выполняется, если коэффициент при (x) не равен нулю, что здесь и наблюдается (коэффициент равен 5). Значит, функция (f(x)) инъективна. **Сюръективность (наложение):** Функция сюръективна, если для каждого элемента из множества значений (области значений) существует хотя бы один элемент из области определения, который отображается в данный элемент. В случае линейной функции, она сюръективна на множестве вещественных чисел (mathbb{R}), поскольку может принимать любые вещественные значения. Так как конкретное множество (B) не определено и мы предполагаем работу с (mathbb{R}), (f(x)) можно считать сюръективной. Таким образом, (f(x)) является биекцией на (mathbb{R}), так как она и инъективна, и сюръективна одновременно. **Обратная функция:** Для биекции обратная функция существует. Найдем ее для (f(x)): [y = 5x + 3] [y - 3 = 5x] [x = frac{y - 3}{5}] Отсюда обратная функция (f^{-1}(x) = frac{x - 3}{5}). # Функция (g(x) = -5x + 4) Проведем аналогичный анализ. **Инъективность:** Так как линейный коэффициент при (x) (-5) не равен нулю, функция (g(x)) также инъективна. **Сюръективность:** Аналогично, линейная функция может принимать любые значения из (mathbb{R}), таким образом, (g(x)) также может быть считана сюръективной, если рассматривается множество вещественных чисел. Значит, (g(x)) также является биекцией на (mathbb{R}). **Обратная функция:** Найдем обратную функцию для (g(x)): [y = -5x + 4] [y - 4 = -5x] [x = frac{4 - y}{5}] Отсюда обратная функция (g^{-1}(x) = frac{4 - x}{5}).

Here are four highly effective skill moves ideal for defenders, along with a step-by-step guide on how to perform each. # 1. **Jockeying** **Objective**: To control the attacker’s movements and guide them into a less threatening position. **Tutorial**: - **Step 1**: Face the attacker, maintaining a low centre of gravity by bending your knees slightly. - **Step 2**: Keep your eyes on the ball, staying light on your feet to quickly react to the attacker’s movements. - **Step 3**: Position yourself about an arm's length away from the attacker, ensuring you’re close enough to pressure yet far enough to react to any direction change. - **Step 4**: If the attacker tries to go past you, use small, quick steps to maintain your position between them and the goal. # 2. **Slide Tackling** **Objective**: To dispossess an opponent in a manner that minimizes the risk of committing a foul. **Tutorial**: - **Step 1**: Judge the right moment to tackle, typically when the ball is out of the opponent’s close control. - **Step 2**: Approach the attacker at an angle, not directly from behind, to reduce the risk of fouling. - **Step 3**: Launch yourself towards the ball, leading with one leg extended to poke the ball away, keeping your other leg bent for control. - **Step 4**: Aim to connect with the ball first, using the inside of your foot for a cleaner sweep. # 3. **Fake Throw** **Objective**: For situations where defenders take throw-ins, misdirecting opponents to create space for a safe pass. **Tutorial**: - **Step 1**: Grip the ball as if preparing for a long throw to a targeted player. - **Step 2**: Make a convincing throwing motion towards your initial target but without releasing the ball. - **Step 3**: Quickly switch the direction of your body and eyes to throw the ball to a less marked teammate. - **Step 4**: This move should be executed swiftly to catch the opposing players off-guard. # 4. **Shoulder Drop** **Objective**: To create space by deceiving the attacker into believing you’re moving in a direction you're not. **Tutorial**: - **Step 1**: With the ball at your feet, face the approaching attacker. - **Step 2**: Drop your shoulder and lean slightly in the direction you want the attacker to believe you’re heading. - **Step 3**: As the attacker reacts, quickly switch direction by pushing off strongly from your leading foot. - **Step 4**: Accelerate away in the new direction, creating space between you and the attacker. # Final Thoughts: Mastering these skills requires practice and situational awareness. As a defender, the key is not just in executing these moves but knowing when and where to use them effectively. Regularly incorporating these techniques into your training sessions will help make them second nature during matches, enhancing your defensive capabilities. Remember, the best defense is not just about physicality but also intelligence and trickery on the ball."},{"instruction":"как меняется график гиперболы при смене коэффицента","output":"Гипербола – это геометрическое место точек, разность расстояний от каждой из которых до двух данных точек (фокусов) есть величина постоянная.

Гиперболы состоят из двух отдельных ветвей. Как изменение коэффициентов (a) и (b) влияет на форму гиперболы: 1. **Изменение коэффициента (a):** - Увеличение значения (a) расширяет гиперболу вдоль оси (x) и делает ветви более \\"плоскими\\" и распространенными горизонтально. - Уменьшение значения (a) сужает гиперболу вдоль оси (x) и делает ветви более крутыми, приближая их к оси (y). 2. **Изменение коэффициента (b):** - Увеличение значения (b) расширяет гиперболу вдоль оси (y), делая ветви более \\"плоскими\\" и распространенными вертикально. - Уменьшение значения (b) сужает гиперболу вдоль оси (y), делая ветви более крутыми, приближая их к оси (x).

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to perform this skillful maneuver effectively: # 1. Reading the Opponent - **Analyze the Stance**: Look for opponents standing with their legs apart. The wider the stance, the larger the gap to target. - **Predict Movements**: Anticipate where the opponent will move next. If they are shifting weight to one foot, they’re more likely to open up a gap. - **Engage Directly**: Approach the defender directly to make it easier to predict which way they’ll move based on your actions. # 2. Dribbling and Position - **Close Control**: Keep the ball close to your feet with deft touches. This gives you the precision needed to execute a nutmeg. - **Body Feints**: Use your body to feint or fake movements to prompt the defender to move in a certain way or to open their legs. # 3. The Execution - **Timing**: Wait for the precise moment when the opponent opens their legs slightly. This is often when they’re about to take a step. - **Positioning**: Position your body as if you’re going to pass or move in one direction but intend to nutmeg in the opposite. - **The Technique**: There are a few techniques to execute a nutmeg: - **The Push**: Gently push the ball through the opponent’s legs with the inside or outside of your foot. - **The Roll**: Roll the ball using the sole of your foot between the opponent’s legs. - **The Flick**: Flick the ball with the outside of your foot, especially if the defender is moving towards you or by your side. # 4. Acceleration - **Burst of Speed**: After executing the nutmeg, immediately accelerate to get past the opponent and regain control of the ball. - **Keep Your Eyes on the Ball**: Maintain focus on the ball rather than watching the nutmeg itself. This helps in regaining control faster. # 5. Practice and Situation Awareness - **Repetitive Training**: Practice nutmegs regularly during training sessions not just standing still but against moving opponents. - **Game Application**: Start applying this in less risky scenarios (like in training games or when leading comfortably) to build confidence. # 6. Warning and Fair Play - **Be Humble**: While nutmegging can be exciting and humiliating for the opponent, always play with respect towards everyone on the pitch. - **Know When to Use It**: Not every situation is suitable for a nutmeg. Ensure its use is effective for the play and not just for show. # Extra Tip In tight spaces or during one-on-one confrontations, being unpredictable is your greatest asset. Mixing up your dribbling patterns, speed, and even throwing in a stepover or two before attempting a nutmeg can make the execution much more successful. Remember, successful footballers play with their head up, constantly scanning the field and their opponents. Integrating nutmegs into your skillset is beneficial, but the best players know when to use them effectively as part of their broader game strategy."},{"instruction":"Find me free chromium based open source browsers","output":"Open-source Chromium-based browsers offer a variety of features and philosophies, catering to different user preferences and priorities, such as privacy, customization, and speed.

Here are step-by-step tutorials and drills for enhancing these critical skills: # 1. Reaction Time Improving your reaction time means enhancing your ability to quickly respond to the game's dynamics. **Drills**: - **Cone Taps Drill**: Set up a line of cones. Have a partner call out instructions (\\"left,\\" \\"right,\\" \\"forward,\\" \\"back\\") and quickly move to tap the indicated cone. This drill enhances your ability to react swiftly to verbal cues. - **Ball Drop**: Have a partner hold a ball at shoulder height and drop it without warning. Try to catch it before it hits the ground. Gradually increase the difficulty by standing further back. - **Visual Cue Reaction**: Use a reaction light app or have a partner flash colored cards randomly. Each color should represent a different activity (e.g., sprint, jump, turn). React by performing the activity as quickly as possible. # 2. Ball Control Good ball control allows you to keep the ball close and maneuver through tight spaces under pressure. **Drills**: - **Wall Passes**: Stand a few meters from a wall. Pass the ball against the wall and control the rebound with one touch, aiming to keep the ball close to your feet. Alternate feet and vary the angle and speed of your passes. - **Cone Dribbling**: Set up a line or grid of cones. Dribble the ball through the cones using close touches, keeping the ball as close to your feet as possible. Focus on using both feet and changing pace. - **Juggling**: Start with keeping the ball in the air using your feet. As you become more comfortable, try to use different parts of your body (thigh, chest, head). This drill improves your touch and control over the ball. # 3. Decision Making Quick and effective decision-making is crucial for utilizing your ball control and reaction skills effectively in a game scenario. **Drills**: - **Small-Sided Games**: Playing in small-sided games (e.g., 3v3, 4v4) forces you to make quicker decisions due to the limited space and time. Focus on quickly assessing your options every time you receive the ball. - **Positional Rondos**: This is a passing drill where the objective is to maintain possession within a small grid with an outnumbered opposing team. It improves your ability to make quick decisions under pressure. - **Scanning Practice**: Work on your ability to 'scan' the field before you receive the ball. You can practice this by asking a partner to hold up fingers behind your back as you receive a pass. Before turning to control the ball, you should glance back to see how many fingers your partner is holding up, training you to constantly assess your environment. # General Tips - **Practice Consistently**: Improvement comes with regular, focused practice. Incorporate these drills into your routine several times a week. - **Play More**: Join pick-up games or practice matches to apply these skills in game-like scenarios. - **Mental Visualization**: Picture yourself performing these skills successfully. Visualization helps build neural pathways that translate to physical performance. - **Stay Fit**: Good physical conditioning improves your overall speed and endurance, allowing you to execute skills more effectively. By dedicating time to each of these areas, you'll see improvement not just in these specific skills but in your overall game performance.

This did not just affect members of the lower orders. It was certainly the case that the gentry were prosecuted mainly at episcopal courts, but occasionally - particularly in cases of 'recusancy' (i.e. neglect of church attendance and communion) they might also appear before the arch-deacon.116 The large number of condemnations by the church courts dem-onstrates on the one hand the frequently delivered verdict that the English people were on the whole 'ungovernable', i.e. not fully in thrall to the 'secular development' of social disciplining, while on the other hand the effectiveness of these courts in terms of public order depended on the collaboration of judicial institutions. The best evidence for this is given by all those conflicts in which this collaboration was lacking and hence local order was considerably damaged.117 For without local support and recognition, the church's autono-mous judicial power was greatly confined, even if it was promoted by the crown. This is especially shown in the punishment of 'recusants'. As long as this was simply a question of Catholics, prosecution generally remained con-fined to prominent individuals, on whom fines were usually imposed by way of example. If the offenders were particularly prestigious, the imposition of these penalties was the responsibility of episcopal commissions. The activity of these, however, was combated by the gentry, who saw this as an encroach-ment on the local structures of estate rule. When the laws against recusants were sharpened in 1584, the imposition of the law was transferred to purely secular judicial commissions. These could only intervene on the basis of a report from the local secular and spiritual instances. Their effectiveness was thus subject to preliminary considerations of local politics. If religious power could only involve itself judicially with good order with the support of the local ruling estates, the Reformation also brought a shift in secular judicial power. For conflicts over questions of faith and the require-ments of piety at a local level led - even if these tendencies should not be over-estimated in their practical effect - to a redefinition of the meaning of ‘public office' - to a moralising of rulership. This was possible because the Justices of the Peace and their estate colleagues also included Puritans, or at least Christians who demanded both of themselves and others that they should regard their secular offices as a work entrusted to them by God. The moralisation of rule meant a redefinition of the habitus of the ruling estates, above all that of the gentry. Patrick Collinson sees this reorientation of what was in practice an already established ruling estate (Collinson says ‘class') as the real ‘rise of the gentry'.118 The cultural transformation of the notion of rule was certainly promoted in the main by members of the gentry, but in no way was it exclusively developed by them. Rather, the moralising of rule under the English ancien régime was also a product of the public discourse - partially independent of power - that developed in the wake of the Reformation. This found expression in the distribution of religious tracts, in conflicts over seating in the church,119 but above all in the claim persistently made by Christians to the right to read the Bible for themselves and pursue with other Christians a way of life pleasing to God. Sanctioning of conditions of appropriation by ruling power In the two centuries before the partial revolutionising of the ancien régime, the conditions of material reproduction of a large part of the English population underwent a significant change. Research has focused above all on the trans- formation of relations of production, and among these the change in practices of appropriation and the results of appropriation of members of the higher nobility and gentry. For a while, this last point was linked with the question of the causes of the ‘English Revolution'. This has not been good either for analysis of the social causes of the revolution or for the discovery of groups bearing the processes of capitalisation (cf. below). In the following section, we shall deal with change in conditions of repro-duction exclusively from the standpoint of their being sanctioned by the ruling power. This restricts the presentation to those characteristics of appropriation that formed structural peculiarities of the epoch of the ancien régime (cf. Part Five, 1 and 2). In this analytical context, two aspects of the structural change in the countryside are particularly important: the dissolution of traditional con-vergences of interest and the sanctioning of private relations of exploitation by the generalised power. New convergences of interest especially arose in connection with strategies of commercialisation. Recent research has come to see the general level of commercialisation as somewhat less than was previously thought. Even in the early seventeenth century, very many peasants still oriented their production almost entirely to the goal of providing for their own household. The money that they needed to pay for supplies and if necessary also for taxes (the poorer peasant families generally escaped direct taxation), they sought to obtain by occasional wage-labour and domestic work. Even among the nobility, orien-tation to marketable sources of income was in no way universal at this time. Instead, many members of the higher nobility and upper gentry persisted in forms of production that could serve as the basis for a hospitable household and the needs of a retinue. As regards the readiness of peasants to hire them-selves out for war service, for example, only those lords could hope for this who did not seek to extricate themselves from the structure of traditional rul-ership. But despite this, many members of the upper nobility and gentry, and even many richer peasants, made use of the prospects for appropriation that were offered by sales opportunities both at home and abroad. Strategies of commercialisation did not always compete with the reproduc-tion prospects of those who could not make use of these - at least not initially and not in every case.120 As long as villages were almost depopulated, peasant holdings unoccupied and common land only little used - as was still the case many decades after the Black Death of the mid fourteenth century - commercial strategies of individual landowners, such as were expressed in enclosures, engrossing of farms, and the transformation of agricultural land into pasture, did not necessarily threaten the reproduction prospects of the poor rural population. This changed however as the population grew, entry fines for tenures were abolished and freehold tenancies were so reduced as a result of divided inheritance that use of the common land became an indispensable condition of material reproduction. For many a younger son of peasants, the ‘structural change in the countryside at this time meant the inability to found a family of his own, if he was not actually forced into vagabondage in search of a livelihood of some kind; for many families it brought the loss of that provision, experienced as a 'good life', which their grandparents' generation had enjoyed. On the other hand, other peasant families of this time expanded the land in their possession by purchasing or leasing, especially in the grainproducing areas. To cultivate this they employed labourers (not uncommonly their poorer neighbours). The wages that they paid fell ever further behind the inflationary trend of prices from the mid sixteenth century on. Of the two or three more prosperous yeomen that there generally were in each village, many now sought, just like the lords, to stop pasture being divided up into fields, which at this time were not yet enclosed. But they were certainly quite prepared to accept the enclosure plans of the lords if they could participate in these themselves. By way of declarations of agreement of the 'inhabitants', however, enclosures were made legal - apart from a few individual cases that were declared 'unjust'. In this way, there arose a (partial) convergence of interest among those with commercially oriented agricultural 'enterprises'. It was not rare for such an interest to be conflict with that of the poorer peasants, who had always been oriented towards use-value. The dissolution of earlier convergences of interest brought about the struc-tural preconditions for the particular English form of transition from feudal-ism to capitalism in the countryside: the prevalence of profit interests at the expense of independent small-peasant modes of existence. Strategies of this kind were successful because, whilst the English peasants had indeed succeeded in winning their personal freedom - the last of them, however, only in the first three decades of the seventeenth century121 -, this generally did not automatically mean private property in their tenures; their possession of land remained subject to restrictions, differing from one manor to another, that were set down in a copy of the roll of the manor court (hence the term 'copyhold'). Even peasants who now held their land in the form of copyhold rather than freehold obtained in the course of the sixteenth century the protection of their rights of possession by the general judicial power. The first steps by which this was accomplished were the introduction of proceedings for 'trespass' in common law, or the appeal to the Chancellor, who could make decisions outside the common law on the principle of equity. This legal protection, however, still applied only within the conditions of copyhold. These were established in the context of decentralised rule. Whether a peasant holding was heritable under conditions of freehold, whether it remained in the pos-session of a peasant family for one tenancy or three, or else for a fixed term, was decided between the tenant and the owner of the land. It was within these limits that the right of possession of copyhold tenures was sanctioned by the generalised power.”翻译为中文","output":"性犯罪、违反婚姻义务、轻佻言行、忽视教堂出席、争斗和亵渎等罪名的记录性定罪数量相当可观。这不仅影响了下层阶级的成员。确实有这样的情况，即贵族主要在主教法院被起诉，但偶尔——特别是在'拒绝'（即忽视教堂出席和圣餐）的情况下，他们也可能出现在副主教面前。教会法院大量的定罪案例一方面展现了常有的裁决，即英国人民总体上是'不可管束的'，即他们并未完全受到'世俗发展'即社会纪律化的驾驭，另一方面，这些法院在维护公共秩序方面的有效性依赖于司法机构的合作。所有缺乏这种合作从而严重损害了地方秩序的冲突案例都证明了这一点。因为没有地方的支持和认可，教会的自主司法权力被极大地限制了，即使这得到了王室的推动。这在对'拒绝者'的惩罚中特别明显。只要这仅仅是天主教徒的问题，起诉通常限于突出个体，通常通过罚款来示范性地惩罚。如果违法者特别有声望，这些处罚的施加是由主教委员会负责的。然而，这些活动受到了贵族的抵制，他们将此视为对地方地产统治结构的侵犯。当1584年反拒绝者的法律加强时，法律的执行被转移到纯粹的世俗司法委员会。它们只能基于来自地方世俗和宗教实例的报告进行干预。因此，它们的有效性取决于地方政治的初步考虑。 如果宗教权力仅在地方统治阶层的支持下，才能在好秩序上进行司法干预，宗教改革也带来了世俗司法权力的转移。因为在地方层面上对信仰问题和虔诚要求的争执导致了'公职'含义的重新定义——即统治的道德化。这是可能的，因为治安法官及其地产同僚中也包括清教徒，或至少是那些要求自己和他人将他们的世俗职务视为上帝赋予他们的工作的基督徒。统治的道德化意味着对统治阶层习惯的重新定义，尤其是贵族阶层。帕特里克·科林森将这种实践中已经确立的统治阶层（科林森称之为'阶层'）的重新定位视为贵族真正的'崛起'。文化对统治观念的转变确实主要由贵族成员推动，但并非仅由他们独自开发。相反，在宗教改革的背景下发展起来的、部分独立于权力的公共话语也促成了统治下的道德化。这在宗教小册子的传播、教堂座位争执中表现出来，但最重要的是在基督徒坚持自己阅读圣经并与其他基督徒一起追求讨上帝喜悦的生活方式的权利上。 统治权力对占有条件的制裁 在朝代部分革命化的前两个世纪，英格兰大部分人口的物质再生产条件发生了显著变化。研究主要集中在生产关系的转变上，其中包括占有实践的变化及高级贵族和贵族成员的占有结果变化。一段时间以来，这最后一点与'英格兰革命'原因的问题联系在一起。这对于分析革命的社会原因或发现资本化过程的承担群体都没有好处。 接下来，我们将从统治权力制裁这些条件的角度来处理再生产条件的变化。这限制了呈现那些构成了朝代特有结构特点的占有特征（参见第五部分，1和2）。在这个分析背景下，乡村结构变化的两个方面尤为重要：传统利益一致性的解体和通过普遍化权力对私人剥削关系的制裁。 新的利益一致性与商业化策略有关。最新研究倾向于看到，商业化的总体水平比之前认为的要低一些。早在十七世纪早期，许多农民仍然几乎完全以为自己的家庭提供生活为目标来定向他们的生产。他们通过偶然的雇佣劳动和家庭工作来获取必要支付供应品的钱款，如果需要，也用于缴税（较穷的农民家庭通常免于直接税收）。即便在贵族中，也不是所有人都在这时候普遍面向可市场化的收入来源。相反，许多高级贵族和上层贵族坚持生产形式，这些形式可以用作好客家庭和随从需求的基础。至于农民愿意为战争服务而受雇，例如，只有那些不寻求摆脱传统统治结构的领主才能期待这一点。但尽管如此，许多高级贵族和贵族，甚至许多较富裕的农民都利用了国内外销售机会所提供的占有机会。 商业化策略最初并不总是与那些无法利用这些机会的人的再生产前景竞争——至少最初不是这样，也不是在每个案例中都是这样。只要村庄几乎被废弃，农户未占用，公共土地只有少量使用——就像中世纪黑死病之后的许多十年一样——个别土地所有者的商业化策略，如圈地、农场兼并和将农田转变为牧场，并不一定威胁到贫穷农村人口的再生产前景。然而，随着人口增长，租地进入费被废除，自由地租的农户由于分割继承而减少，以至于使用公共土地成为物质再生产的不可或缺条件。对于许多农民的年轻子孙来说，当时乡村的'结构变化'意味着无法自己创立家庭，如果他实际上不是被迫流浪寻找某种生活方式；对于许多家庭来说，这带来了他们祖父母一代享受的所谓'美好生活'的丧失。另一方面，这个时期的其他农民家庭通过购买或租赁扩大了他们拥有的土地，特别是在产粮区。为了耕种这些土地，他们雇用了劳动者（不常见的是他们较贫穷的邻居）。从十六世纪中叶开始，他们支付的工资越来越落后于价格的通胀趋势。 在每个村庄中普遍有两到三个较富裕的自耕农，许多人现在寻求，就像领主一样，阻止牧场被划分成田地，这在当时还没有被圈起来。但如果他们能自己参与到这些计划中，他们当然很愿意接受领主的圈地计划。通过'居民'的同意声明，除了少数被宣布为'不公正'的个案外，圈地变得合法。 通过这种方式，那些以商业化定向的农业'企业'之间产生了（部分）利益一致性。这种兴趣与始终面向使用价值的贫穷农民的利益产生冲突的情况并不罕见。 早期利益一致性的解体为英国乡村从封建制向资本主义的特殊形式转变奠定了结构前提：独立小农模式的生存以牺牲利润利益为代价。 此类策略之所以成功，是因为虽然英国农民确实成功赢得了他们的个人自由——然而，最后一些人仅在十七世纪前三十年获得——这通常并不自动意味着他们土地的私有财产；他们对土地的占有仍受限于不同领地之间所规定的限制（因此称为'副本保留地'）。 即使是现在以副本保留地而非自由地方式持有土地的农民，也在十六世纪获得了他们占有权利的普遍法律保护。这是通过引入普通法中的'侵权行为'程序或向大法官上诉来实现的，后者可以在公平原则下在普通法之外做出决定。然而，这种法律保护仍然只适用于副本保留地的条件内。这些条件是在分散统治的背景下建立的。一个农民佃户是在自由土地条件下遗传的，还是在一个租期或三个租期内，或者是固定期限内留在一个农民家庭中的，由佃户和土地所有者之间决定。正是在这些限制内，副本保留地佃权被普遍化权力制裁。"},{"instruction":"请将“In so far as they had both courage and resources to make a complaint, peas-ants - at least free ones - could appeal to the judicial instances of generalised power against their lords. Recorded decisions in favour of peasants, however, should not deceive us into thinking that judicial neutrality did not sanction structures of exploitation. Justice marked the legal limits of these at the time, as well as the legal ways of appropriating land that had previously been given out on lease. For on the expiry of a 'customary tenure' (thus for example after the course of 'three lives'), land could be demanded back and newly offered on different terms. In the decades-long scholarly dispute about the legal protection of copyhold (arising from R.H. Tawney's work of 1912), it has partly been overlooked that this protection only ever applied to those peasant rights of possession that were not restricted by the 'copy'. Since the English peasantry - in contrast to the English nobility - had been successful only to a limited degree in their efforts to appropriate hereditary possession of the land, the generalised judicial instance sanctioned the structures of exploitation that resulted from this failure. This changed the conditions of struggles over the forms of peasant exploitation. For resistance to the results of judicial decision no longer meant just resistance against the possessor of a manorial court, but resistance to the generalised power. This sanctioning function of generalised (judicial) power for the results of class-structured conflicts over the conditions of appropriation stands in apparent contradiction with the ‘agricultural pol-icy' decisions of the crown. For the repeated laws against enclosure give the appearance of a regulation of the conditions of appropriation by the crown and its parliament in favour of the reproduction requirements of the peasants. The involvement of a small part of the ruling estates in this legislation, however, was certainly not sufficient to ensure its application. Two structural obstacles stood in the way of a policy of peasant protection. One resulted from the general limits on royal executive power. For as distinct from kingdoms where the crown had wider fiscal and military power, in England there was no social group that enforced the strategies of the crown and could limit local estate power. Since there was no class of officials depending principally on the crown for their social advance, the execution of laws remained dependent on the collaboration of those who wielded local power of office. Despite formal regulations, this collaboration was to a large degree in practice voluntary, and dependent on the agreement of those possessing local influence. The crown could well appoint special commissions to investigate abuses, and these did indeed reverse certain enclosures. But when such commissions were appointed in Edward VI's reign, to see that the letter of the law was upheld, it soon emerged that the crown was not in a position to carry through a policy counter to the widespread interests of the landholders. Since the peasant uprising of 1549 known as Ket's Rebellion was directed among other things against enclosures, the government of Lord Protector Somerset was ascribed responsibility for all the ‘discontent' in the countryside. The second structural obstacle to a successful policy of peasant protection arose from the already dis-cussed development of diverging interests among the villagers. Since many of the better-off peasants also had no interest in the legal protection of copyhold-ers, the practical possibilities for exploiting all who abandoned copyhold ten-ures and sold their labour-power for a wage correspondingly broadened. If there were no major peasant revolts after the mid sixteenth century, this was a consequence of the divergence of interests among the village population. The members of the ruling estates therefore had no occasion to effectively apply the laws against enclosures and combinations in their locality. There certainly was a great deal of local resistance to these laws, which was punished time and again. But 'condemnations' of this kind amount on closer inspection to more like a kind of tax. They were not high, and could be taken into account by the landowners as a possible cost factor in the reorganisation of cultivation they planned to pursue. In practice, the crown's policy of peasant protection had long been ineffec-tive by the time it was formally abandoned - in the wake of the revolutionary transformation of the ancien régime. The regulation of reproduction conditions in the countryside by centralised power was essentially confined to sanction-ing the limited property rights of copyhold tenants. (On bread policy, which also belongs in this context, see below.) This made it that much easier to exclude poorer peasant families from possession of land and thus at the same time expand capitalist relations of production in the countryside. Besides the sanctioning of existing relations of exploitation by the resources of generalised power, the direct material participation of members of the ruling estates in centralised appropriation was a further structural characteristic of material reproduction in societies of the ancien-régime type. England was no exception to this participation. As elsewhere, it was spurred and accelerated by political conflict among members of the ruling estates. Yet both the extent of appropriation by the crown, and (as a consequence) also the material benefit that members of the ruling estates could draw from centralised power of appropriation, was comparatively limited when seen in the overall context of the ruling estates. As the partial revolutionising of the ancien régime proceeded, the possibilities of appropriation by participation in the centralised appropriation power were further reduced. The early configuration of a struc-tural dominance of (individual economic) private appropriation forms one of the most important preconditions for the concrete political form of the devel-opment (and eventual dissolution) of the structures of rule of the ancien régime in England. It is from this point of view - which we shall later develop in more detail - that forms of material private benefit from centralised appropriation power will now be discussed. Strategies of private benefit from centralised power of appropriation were confronted with the steady limitation of royal fiscal power, as this had been pursued since the twelfth century by barons and resisting peasants, and later defended and expanded by Parliament and the obstructive practices of Justices of the Peace. It was not a very great sum, therefore, that could be obtained in the form of presents or payments for services rendered. Moreover, it could not be increased by the creation of new offices and powers to be sold off by the crown - as was the case notably in France. For the generalised estate rule over local government practice made the introduction of new offices possible only at the price of major conflict. (We simply recall here the struggles over the muster masters for the militia.) In view of their permanent financial problems - particularly pressing in time of war, despite the granting of taxes - the English monarchs used whatever opportunity offered itself to improve their income from crown lands and excise duties. But this was not that much. The security guarantees that Henry VII demanded from the great nobles were a politically precarious form of obtaining credit; income from the fiscalisation of forest rights, from 'purveyance' (right of lodging) and from the ‘ship money' with which the inhabitants of coastal regions met their obligation to provide ships for the king, could scarcely be increased; regular presents could not be constantly demanded. There remained the sale of monopolies, to which we shall return, as well as the use of the remaining appropriation powers of feudal rule. To increase their fiscal yield, Henry VII established a special administrative department. In 1540, under Henry VIII, this became the court of Warde. For the management of wards, i.e. guardianship of tenures until the heir came of age, or more precisely, the sale of the right to make economic use of the tenure during the period of wardship, was the one feudal right that was potentially most profitable. The policy of the court of Warde can be deemed, at least initially, a political success but not a fiscal one.122 On average, in the years 1558 to 1599, the annual income from wards was £14,700. Elizabeth's share in Drake's pirate enterprises, on the other hand, very likely amounted in the period 1577-80 to more than a quarter of a million pounds. Income from wards would not even have sufficed to pay the annual interest on the crown's foreign debts. In fact, the court of Warde could only be indirectly used for the monarch's own benefit: in the second half of the sixteenth century, it sold wardships at approximately the same price, while grain prices and land rents rose almost threefold. The real price of wardships, however, evolved to match the actual possibilities of profit. The difference went to the middlemen who arranged the sale. These were in almost all cases great men of state, including the holders of major offices. In this way they increased the nominally low reward for their services that they received from the crown. The level of their profit differed, depending on the concrete conditions of a particular wardship, on the particular market situation in this deal and on individual appropriation strategies. From the reign of Henry VIII until almost the end of that of Elizabeth, the crown kept to the practice of an indirect material supplement to the incomes of great nobles and (other) office-holders. When Cecil Roberts succeeded his father as Master of the Warde in 1599, this policy came to an end. This did not make wards any dearer for their purchasers, but it cut down or abolished altogether the profits of the middlemen. Possession of this office was thus less materially attractive. What was worse was that this injured the established interests of powerful politicians, interests they saw as justified. Tenants of the king had criticised the court of Warde since its foundation. At the turn of the seventeenth century, the crown additionally lost the goodwill that had previ-ously been extended to this court by influential circles. Incomes from ‘tenure right' rested formally on the legal fiction of continuing feudal dependence. In this way, it was possible to circumvent Parliament. In the course of time, however (first of all with the struggles over the Statute of Uses under Henry VIII), the semblance of feudal rule was also discontinued in particular decrees. In 1610, for example, James I was perfectly prepared to renounce his rights of ward and purveyance, if - in the projected ‘Great Con-tract' - this was replaced by other regular incomes. Charles I also demanded that everyone with an income of more than £40 who had not on the day of his coronation applied to become a knight, should pay a fine. But he also demanded this fine from two lords who had fulfilled the requirement but had not been knighted by the king.”翻译为中文","output":"在他们有勇气和资源提出投诉的情况下，农民——至少是自由农民——可以针对他们的领主向普遍权力的司法机构提出上诉。然而，记录中有利于农民的判决不应使我们误以为司法中立不会对剥削结构给予制裁。正义标志着当时这些结构的法律界限，以及之前通过租约分配的土地的合法占有方式。因为在“习惯性租赁”（例如在“三世”期满后）到期时，可以要求收回土地，并以不同条件重新提供。在长达数十年的关于副本保留地法律保护的学术争议中（起源于R.H. Tawney 1912年的作品），部分忽略了这种保护仅适用于未被“副本”限制的农民占有权。英国农民与英国贵族相比，只在有限程度上成功争取到土地的世袭占有权，普遍的司法实例对由此产生的剥削结构给予了制裁。这改变了关于农民剥削形式的斗争条件。因为抵抗司法决策的结果不再仅意味着抵抗领地法庭的占有者，而是对抗普遍权力。普遍（司法）权力对类结构冲突中占有条件结果的制裁功能与皇冠的“农业政策”决策显然矛盾。因为反复的反圈地法律给人一种皇冠及其议会为了农民的再生产要求而调控占有条件的印象。 然而，少部分统治阶层参与这项立法，显然不足以确保其实施。两个结构性障碍阻碍了农民保护政策的实施。一个是由皇室行政权力的一般限制所导致的。因为与皇冠拥有更广泛的财政和军事权力的王国不同，在英格兰没有一个社会群体强制执行皇冠的策略，并且能限制地方地产权力。由于没有一个主要依赖皇冠来提升社会地位的官员阶层，法律的执行仍然依赖于那些拥有地方职权的人的合作。尽管有正式规定，这种合作在实践中在很大程度上是自愿的，依赖于拥有地方影响力者的同意。皇冠确实可以任命特别委员会来调查滥用行为，这些委员会确实撤销了某些圈地行为。但当爱德华六世在位时任命这样的委员会以维护法律的严格执行时，很快就暴露出皇冠无力实施违背广泛地主利益的政策。由于1549年被称为Ket's Rebellion的农民起义反对圈地行为，索默塞特勋爵政府被认为对农村的所有“不满”负有责任。成功实施农民保护政策的第二个结构障碍源于已经讨论过的村落内部利益分歧的发展。由于许多较富裕的农民对副本持有者的法律保护也不感兴趣，因此剥削所有放弃副本保有权并以工资出卖劳动力的人的实际可能性相应扩大了。如果在十六世纪中叶之后没有出现重大的农民起义，这是由于村庄人口间利益分歧的结果。因此，统治阶层成员没有理由有效地在他们的地区实施反圈地和联合行为的法律。 这些法律确实遭到了大量的地方抵抗，这种抵抗一次又一次地被惩罚。但是，仔细检查这类“定罪”更像是一种税。它们不高，地主可以将其作为计划中的耕作重组的可能成本因素考虑在内。 实际上，在正式放弃之前，皇冠的农民保护政策早已失效——在旧制度革命性转变的后果中。乡村再生产条件的中央权力调控实际上局限于对副本保有佃户有限财产权的制裁。（关于面包政策，它也属于这一背景，见下文。）这使得更容易排除较贫困的农民家庭对土地的占有，从而同时扩大乡村中的资本主义生产关系。 除了普遍权力资源对现有剥削关系的制裁之外，统治阶层成员直接参与中央集权性占有还是旧制度类型社会物质再生产的另一个结构特征。英格兰在这种参与上并不例外。和其他地方一样，这种参与由统治阶层成员之间的政治冲突激发和加速。然而，无论是皇冠的占有范围还是（作为后果）统治阶层成员可以从中央集权性占有权力中获得的物质利益，在统治阶层整体背景下来看都相对有限。随着旧制度的部分革命化进程，通过参与中央集权性占有权力的占有机会进一步减少。早期私人占有形式的结构性主导地位是英格兰旧制度统治结构发展（最终解体）的具体政治形式最重要的前提之一。从这个角度——我们稍后会更详细地展开讨论——现在将讨论从中央集权性占有权力中获得私人物质利益的形式。 从中央集权性占有权力中获得私人利益的策略面临皇家财政权力稳步限制的挑战，这种限制自十二世纪以来就由男爵和反抗的农民追求，后来由议会和治安法官的阻碍性做法捍卫和扩大。因此，通过礼物或提供服务而获得的金额并不大。此外，通过皇冠销售新的职位和权力也无法增加——这在法国尤为明显。因为普遍的地产统治对地方政府实践的制约仅以重大冲突的代价才能引入新职位。（我们在这里简单回顾一下关于民兵队的点将官的斗争。）鉴于永远存在的财政问题——尽管征税，特别是在战时压力特别大——英格兰君主利用一切机会提高来自皇家土地和消费税的收入。但这并不多。亨利七世要求的从大贵族那里获得的担保是一种政治上不稳定的获信方式；来自森林权利财政化、“征粮权”（住宿权）以及沿海地区居民用来满足为国王提供船只义务的“船税”的收入几乎无法增加；定期礼物不能不停地要求。剩下的就是销售专利权，我们将回到这一点，以及使用剩余的封建统治占有权力。为了增加财政收入，亨利七世建立了一个特别的行政部门。1540年，在亨利八世统治下，这成为了监护法院。因为管理监护权，即直到继承人成年为止土地的监护权，或更准确地说，出售在监护期间进行经济利用的权利，是潜在最有利可图的一项封建权利。监护法院的政策最初可以被视为政治上的成功，但在财政上并非如此。平均而言，在1558年到1599年间，监护权的年收入为14,700英镑。相比之下，伊丽莎白在德雷克的海盗企业中的份额，仅在1577-1580年间，很可能就超过了二十五万英镑。监护权的收入甚至不足以支付皇家外债的年利息。事实上，监护法院只能间接地用于君主自己的利益：在十六世纪下半叶，它以几乎相同的价格出售监护权，而粮价和土地租金几乎增长了三倍。然而，监护权的实际价格演变以适应实际的利润可能性。差价归安排销售的中间人所有。这些几乎在所有情况下都是国家的重要人物，包括主要职务的持有者。通过这种方式，他们增加了来自皇冠的名义上低额报酬。他们的利润水平因特定监护权的具体条件、这笔交易的特定市场情况以及个人占有策略而异。 从亨利八世到伊丽莎白统治结束前，皇冠保持了间接物质补充大贵族和（其他）官员收入的做法。当塞西尔·罗伯茨继承他父亲成为监护法院院长时，这一政策结束了。这并没有使得购买者的监护权变得更贵，但减少了或完全取消了中间人的利润。因此，拥有这一职位在物质上变得不那么有吸引力。更糟糕的是，这损害了强大政治家们既得的、他们认为是正当的利益。自成立以来，国王的佃户就批评监护法院。在十七世纪之交，皇冠此外还失去了此前对这个法院有利的影响力圈子的好感。 “地租权”收入在形式上依赖于持续的封建依赖的法律虚构。通过这种方式，可以规避议会。然而，随着时间的推移（首先是在亨利八世统治下关于使用法案的斗争中），封建统治的假象在特定法令中也被终止。例如，在1610年，詹姆斯一世完全准备放弃他的监护权和征粮权，如果——在计划中的“大合同”中——这可以被其他规律性收入所取代。查理一世还要求每个收入超过40英镑的人，在他加冕那天没有申请成为骑士的，应支付罚款。但他还从两位满足要求但未被国王封为骑士的贵族那里要求了这笔罚款。"},{"instruction":"请将“In the short term, the material basis of the crown was expanded by the expropriation of episcopal property and the dissolution of the monasteries. Most of the properties appropriated in this way by the crown, however, were sold - a large part of the receipts going to finance Henry VIII's wars. After 1549, the crown found itself forced to alienate holdings that came into its possession without feudal obligations. In this way, the greater part of former church properties were removed from the fiscalised feudal power of the crown. It was families of the gentry, above all, who profited from this trade.123 A fundamental improvement in the appropriation opportunities of this social group was thus not the result of long-run structural changes, but rather of political decisions, the structural necessity of which can in no way be clearly demonstrated - at any rate not for Henry VlII's military undertakings on the Continent. The result of estate strategies that aimed at limiting the autonomous fiscal power of the crown made it well-nigh impossible to construct an 'apparatus' of royal rule whose members would be materially dependent on the crown. The greater part of government personnel worked for the English kings without being paid by the crown. This was particularly true of the Justices of the Peace and the clergy. Before the Reformation, the crown made use of senior clerics as ministers and ambassadors; after the Reformation it established 'cost-free' instances of administration in the religious parishes. Along with the conduct of registers of births, marriages and deaths, these were also responsible for the Poor Law. To anticipate potential misunderstanding, we should stress that under the ancien régime, official power in any form was an authority for private appro-priation, quite irrespective of whether it was endowed with a greater or lesser remuneration. The exploitation of the authority granted for private enrichment was seen as completely legitimate. In the course of repeated conflicts, however, many practices were in the long run defined as 'excessive'. Criticism of judicial appropriation in the form of 'maintenance' has already offered an example of such a process of delegitimisation. The restriction of unauthorised private appropriation is particularly clearly shown in impeach-ments of the king's ministers by Parliament. Accusations before Parliament did not generally arise from practices of appropriation, but rather from dif-ferences between parties at court. In these proceedings, however - from the trial of De la Pole in 1387 to that of Stafford in 1640 - the charge of unjustified enrichment was always involved. The limitation of the 'apparatus' financed directly by the crown had far- reaching structural consequences for the development of the ancien régime in England. In the following sections, this will be treated in detail, in relation to both the constitution and reproduction of the ruling estates, and the conditions of government practice. The first point to establish here, however, is that the demand for paid or at least potentially profitable offices was great. There was no formal limitation - i.e. by virtue of estate - on access to particular offices. But since the bestowing of offices arose from mediation and political influence (patronage), disposal of attractive appointments lay to a large extent in the hands of great nobles. In so far as these offered positions to less elevated lords, they at least drew material profit from their activity as middlemen. The trade in wardships, as depicted above, illustrates this connection. Offices improved the income of members of the high nobility; they offered the eldest sons of peers access to influential circles of the kingdom, and their younger sons an employment that at least befitted their status. As Aylmer has shown in his detailed study, between 1625 and 1642 about a quarter of all peers (not including baronets, bishops, and those Englishmen who held peerages in Scotland or Ireland) were in the service of the king.124 Trevor- Roper has pointed out that of the 72 peers newly created by James I, almost all reproduced their status principally by income from offices - rather than their possession of land.125 According to Aylmer, no more than 3 to 4 per cent of families belonging to the gentry had offices in their possession, and for the pseudo-gentry - i.e. the social group of pseudo-nobles whose numbers are hard to define at all accurately - this share in his view was no more than 2 per cent.126 Besides their appropriation by power of office, the possession of those privileges of appropriation that were grouped under the heading of 'monopolies' offered a further important form of private use of centralised power. The right to give out monopolies was based on the authority of the crown to regulate production and trade, in so far as this lay outside the power of the lords. Regulative authority of this kind stretched from the award of special privileges to local or foreign merchant associations, via the granting of corporate statutes to societ-ies engaged in foreign trade and colonisation, to regulations on quality and organisation of manufactures. Many such regulations had a legal form, and were then based quite often on initiatives of the lower house, which in turn arose from petitions expressing the demands of special interests (whether individual or local). As Bindoff has shown, this context applies even to the far-reaching Statute of Artificers of 1563, which for a long time was hailed as the starting-point of systematic labour legislation by the state.127 The importance of prerogative power in regulating the conditions of private appropriation must thus be discussed from two perspectives: in relation to the effectiveness of rather general regulations pertaining to public-order policy, and in relation to the direct improvement of prospects of appropriation by specific individuals. From the 300 or so legal regulations that were decreed by the Tudor mon-archs for manufacture - of which about 250 contained specific penalties for infringement128 - one might conclude that appropriation in the sixteenth cen-tury was structured by power at least in this sphere. This would, however, be mistaken. For the conditions of government practice obstructed the imple-mentation of such arrangements. Available for the enforcement of economic controls and penalties pertaining to these were the constables, as well as the Justices of the Peace at their quarter sessions. Before the Justices could be involved, reports had to be laid before them. (For want of a regular economic police, these were principally the work of more or less professionally operating informants.) The way in which such reports were then dealt with was to a large extent at the discretion of the local Justices. Their actual judicial practice was not only dependent on the particular view they took of their duty, but above all on whether they shared the goals that the crown had striven for in its regulations. It was not uncommon for the economic penalties laid down to be simply not applied; on occasion there were even formal protests by Justices of the Peace against regulations that contradicted manufacturing interests in their district. Considered as a whole, what arose from this in practice was a kind of locally inflected laissez-faire policy. However, the authority of the crown to regulate commerce was not challenged as such. The same applies to the authority of the Justices to fix wages and prices at a local level. In practice, both local and general regulations were usually a question of sanctioning the 'Zeitgeist' - as S.T. Bindoff puts it129 -, expressed, for example, in notions of the proper length of the working day or periods of apprenticeship. More detailed regulations, if they were seen locally to be hindrances, were largely ignored. In relation to monopolies, such a cavalier attitude towards royal prerogative power was less readily possible. For the possessors of monopolies pressed for their upholding. Monopolies were reciprocal agreements. The crown generally profited both fiscally and politically when it conferred a monopoly. The recipients enjoyed an improvement in their competitive position that was sanctioned by power. (In the case of letters of marque and reprisal, which should generally be classed together with monopolies, what was involved was the material participation of the crown in robberies, and the security of not being condemned to death by hanging for this crime.) The extent to which monopolies obstructed the appropriation prospects of competitors, or even ruled out competition altogether, cannot be answered in general terms, but only in the individual case. None the less, the violent political conflicts over the practice of conferring monopolies in the late six-teenth and early seventeenth centuries show that their possession was not seen as unimportant. In the present context, these conflicts are relevant above all because they indicate a development from criticism of the practice of conferring monopolies to criticism of the authority to confer monopolies, in other words a redefinition of the limits of royal prerogative power. In 1575, Elizabeth awarded a series of monopolies that provoked such vio-lent protest that they were withdrawn the same year. These however were monopolies awarded to particular individuals, such as a dispensation from the ban on usury, from certain restrictions on transport and from excise duties. These monopolies also reserved for particular individuals the profits that could be drawn from laying information before the courts.130 The attacks against them bore not so much on the content of these monopolies, but rather on the fact that they were conferred on relatively insignificant courtiers and disregarded established patronage interests. It was rare for powerful nobles to seek monopolies for themselves - for the sake of comparatively uncertain gain131 -, yet they used successful patronage to maintain or extend their politi-cal influence. (In the case adduced here, the royal grant of monopolies offered them the prospect of successful activity as middlemen.) In 1601, Elizabeth formally withdrew most of the monopolies that she had conferred. James I initially lacked such reservation. The Parliament of 1604 therefore took it upon itself to inform the (foreign) king very expressly of the political limits of his prerogative. From now on, the crown no longer conferred 'monopolies' but granted 'patents'. Since, however, it did this very widely, in 1624 - after three years of sometimes very violent debate - Parliament set a legal limit to the granting of patents. From now on, patents were to be reserved to inventors, and a time limit set to their validity. The crown formally accepted these stipulations. But because the demand for politically favoured appropriation prospects was not abolished, and their award was an important means for the crown to obtain political goodwill or reward services, the government simply went over to privileging corporations rather than individual persons. To a large extent, the demand for monopolies came from the circle of (less influential) courtiers. Since the crown had limited possibilities of conferring legal sinecures, paying pensions and distributing presents, courtiers them-selves ventured to propose to the crown what it might offer them - at no cost. They found ever new possibilities for 'monopolies', such as exemption from a general ban on export.132”翻译为中文","output":"短期内，通过征用主教财产和解散修道院，皇冠的物质基础得到了扩大。然而，皇冠通过这种方式占有的大部分财产都被出售了——大部分收入用于资助亨利八世的战争。1549年之后，皇冠发现自己被迫转让未承担封建义务的财产。通过这种方式，大部分以前的教会财产被移除出皇冠的财政化封建权力之外。这种贸易最终使得贵族家庭获益。因此，这个社会群体的占有机会的根本改善并非是长期结构变化的结果，而是政治决策的结果，这些决策的结构性必要性无法清晰地证明——至少对于亨利八世在欧洲大陆的军事行动来说是如此。旨在限制皇冠自主财政权力的贵族策略的结果，使得几乎不可能构建一个成员在物质上依赖皇冠的“皇权机构”。大部分政府人员为英格兰国王工作而无需由皇冠支付报酬。治安法官和神职人员尤其如此。 宗教改革之前，皇冠利用高级神职人员作为大臣和大使；宗教改革之后，它在宗教教区建立了“无成本”的行政实例。除了管理出生、婚姻和死亡登记外，这些还负责贫困法。 为了预防潜在的误解，我们应该强调，在旧制度下，任何形式的官方权力都是私人占有的权威，无论它的报酬是多是少。对授予的权威进行私人牟利被视为完全合法。然而，经过反复冲突，许多做法最终被定义为“过度”。 关于以“维护权”形式进行司法占有的批评已经提供了这种非法征化过程的一个例子。在议会对国王大臣的弹劾中，未经授权的私人占有的限制尤为明显。议会的指控通常不是因为占有行为，而是因为宫廷内各派之间的差异。然而，在这些程序中——从1387年De la Pole的审判到1640年Stafford的审判——都涉及到不正当致富的指控。 皇冠直接资助的“机构”的限制对英格兰旧制度的发展产生了深远的结构性后果。在以下部分中，这将详细讨论，关于统治阶层的构成和再生产以及政府实践的条件。然而，首先要明确的一点是，对有薪酬或至少有潜在盈利机会的职位的需求很大。对于特定职位的进入没有正式限制——即根据地位的限制。但由于职位的授予源于调解和政治影响（赞助），因此吸引力强的任命在很大程度上掌握在大贵族手中。只要这些职位提供给地位较低的贵族，他们至少从其充当中间人的活动中获得物质利润。上文描述的监护权贸易就说明了这种联系。 职位提高了高级贵族成员的收入；它们为贵族长子提供了进入王国有影响力圈子的途径，为他们的弟弟们提供了至少符合他们地位的就业。如艾尔默(Aylmer)在他的详细研究中所示，1625年到1642年间，大约四分之一的所有贵族（不包括男爵、主教和那些在苏格兰或爱尔兰拥有爵位的英国人）为国王服务。特里弗-罗珀指出，由詹姆斯一世新封的72位贵族中，几乎所有人主要通过职位收入而非土地所有权来维持他们的地位。 据艾尔默称，只有3%到4%的贵族家庭拥有职位，对于伪贵族——即难以精确定义数量的伪贵族社会群体——这一比例在他看来不超过2%。除了通过职权占有外，拥有那些被归为“专利”的占有特权提供了另一种重要的私人利用中央权力的形式。颁发专利的权力基于皇冠调控生产和贸易的权威，只要这超出了贵族的权力范围。这种调控权从授予本地或外国商人协会特殊特权，到授予从事国外贸易和殖民活动的公司公司章程，再到对制造业的质量和组织的规定。许多此类规定有法律形式，通常是基于下议院的倡议，而这些倡议又源于表达特殊利益（无论是个人还是地方）的请愿。正如宾多夫所示，这种情况甚至适用于1563年影响深远的《工匠法》，该法长期以来被誉为国家系统劳动立法的起点。 因此，必须从两个角度讨论王权特权在调控私人占有条件中的重要性：一是与公共秩序政策相关的较为一般的规定的有效性，二是与特定个人占有前景的直接改善。 从都铎王朝为制造业颁布的大约300项法规中——其中大约250项包含了特定的违反处罚——可以得出结论，至少在这一领域，十六世纪的占有是由权力结构化的。然而，这将是错误的。因为政府实践的条件阻碍了此类安排的实施。执行经济控制和相关处罚的是警察以及他们的季度会议上的治安法官。在治安法官可以介入之前，必须向他们提交报告。（由于缺乏常规的经济警察，这些报告主要是由或多或少专业运作的信息员完成的。）然后处理此类报告的方式在很大程度上取决于地方治安法官的自由裁量权。他们的实际司法实践不仅取决于他们对职责的特定看法，而且主要取决于他们是否分享皇冠在其规定中争取的目标。规定的经济处罚不常被实施；有时，治安法官甚至正式反对与其地区的制造业利益相矛盾的规定。总的来说，实践中出现的是一种局部特色的放任政策。然而，皇冠调控商业的权威本身并未受到质疑。 同样适用于治安法官在地方层面固定工资和价格的权威。实践中，地方和一般规定通常是对“时代精神”的认可——如S.T. Bindoff所言——例如，关于工作日适当长度或学徒期的观念。如果详细规定在当地被视为障碍，则大多数情况下被忽略。 就专利而言，对王权特权的轻率态度不太可能。因为专利持有者要求维护他们的权利。专利是相互协议。当皇冠授予专利时，通常在财政和政治上都会受益。受益人享受到了由权力认可的竞争地位的提升。（在授予掠夺和报复信函的情况下，通常应将其与专利归为一类，涉及的是皇冠在抢劫中的物质参与，以及因这一罪行而不被判处绞刑的安全保障。） 专利在多大程度上阻碍了竞争者的占有前景，甚至完全排除了竞争，不能一概而论，而只能在个别案例中回答。尽管如此，十六世纪末和十七世纪初关于授予专利实践的激烈政治冲突表明，人们并不认为拥有专利无关紧要。在目前的背景下，这些冲突主要是因为它们标志着从批评授予专利的实践转变为批评授予专利的权威，换句话说，是对王权特权界限的重新定义。 1575年，伊丽莎白授予了一系列引发激烈抗议的专利，以至于同年被撤回。然而，这些专利是授予给特定个人的，如免除放贷禁令、某些运输限制和消费税的豁免。这些专利还为特定个人保留了从向法院提供信息中获得的利润。攻击它们的行为不那么多地针对这些专利的内容，而更多地针对它们被授予相对无足轻重的宫廷侍臣并忽视了既定的赞助利益。强大的贵族很少为自己寻求专利——因为比较不确定的收益——但他们使用成功的赞助来维持或扩大他们的政治影响力。（在这里引用的案例中，皇家授予的专利为他们提供了作为中间人成功活动的前景。） 1601年，伊丽莎白正式撤销了她授予的大部分专利。詹姆斯一世最初没有这样的保留。因此，1604年的议会自行承担了非常明确地告知（外国）国王他的特权的政治界限的责任。从那时起，皇冠不再授予“专利”，而是授予“专利权”。然而，由于它非常广泛地这样做，1624年——经过有时非常激烈的三年辩论之后——议会为授予专利权设定了法律界限。从那时起，专利权应该保留给发明者，并对其有效期设定时限。皇冠正式接受了这些规定。但由于对政治上受青睐的占有前景的需求并未消除，而且其授予是皇冠获得政治好感或奖励服务的重要手段，政府只是转而优惠公司而非个人。 对专利的需求在很大程度上来自（影响较小的）宫廷侍从们。由于皇冠授予法定闲职、支付养老金和分发礼物的可能性有限，宫廷侍从们自己开始向皇冠提议它可以免费提供给他们什么。他们发现了“专利”的新可能性，如免于一般出口禁令的豁免。"},{"instruction":"请将“Viewed as a whole, the practice of granting monopolies provoked more of a conflict between 'haves' and 'have nots'. At most, these conflicts within the ruling estate were kindled by disregard for the established patronage model.133 On occasion, however, a broader public was drawn into the conflicts over monopolies. The protest aroused by the patent conferred by Charles I on the 'soap makers of Westminster' is especially instructive in this respect. I take the depiction of this conflict over this monopoly from Charles Carlton's biography of Charles I:134 The government appeared just as ridiculous when it used the Royal Navy to stop smugglers avoiding the monopoly the King granted the Company of Soapmakers of Westminster. They were a front for a group of the Queen's Catholic friends, authorised in 1631 to use domestic raw materials such as lard, rather than imported fish or whale oil to make soap, which they would sell at 3d a pound, paying the crown a royalty of £4 per ton. The monopoly upset many people: the old makers . . . housewives . . . and many Protestants. So the government put on a public display at the Guildhall, wherein two washer women, watched by the Lord Mayor of London, the aldermen, the Lord Lieutenant of the Tower, and their ladies, scrubbed and rubbed in two tubs to convince the public that the new (and improved) papist soap washed as well, and lathered better, than the Protestant brand However, the public remained sceptical . . . [and] in 1637 - too late to prevent civil war - the washerwomen of England were allowed to return to the foam of their fathers when the Archbishop of Canterbury persuaded the King to take the monopoly away from the Queen's Catholic friends, and return to the old Protestant company, albeit at double the royalty of £8 per ton. As Robert Ashton has shown, the privileging of corporations, especially in London, led to conflicts with merchants who had access to monopolies, licenses or tax-farming.135 It was not simply that the possessors of privileges exploited these to the detriment of their competitors, they very often also monopolised the connection with the crown, and only facilitated the purchase of new patents on condition of their own economic participation in these. In so far as monopolies meant an effective intervention in markets, relations of economic competition took the form of political factions.136 This situation came to a head when - after a temporary retreat by Charles I's government - patents were again conferred (on groups) in the 1630s, since in this way the crown could spare the costs of presents to courtiers, and hoped to derive revenue for itself. By its favouritism and disregard of existing monopolies, however, the king's government managed to alienate its concessionaires polit-ically. Whereas there had been, since the reign of Elizabeth, certain groups of large merchants and manufacturers in the towns, especially London, who by supplying the court, and especially by monopolies and charters conferred by the crown, stood in a tactical economic alliance with the royal overlord - and thus for example even supported the fiscal policy of 1628-9137 - the privileging policy of Charles I unsettled this milieu. The result of this policy was that in 1640 the king could not find new creditors, and London was won to the side of Parliament for the first time since this political conflict began. But the 'monopolies' provoked opposition beyond those who had previously been favoured by the crown. For the economic preconditions for a wideranging criticism of economic regulations tailored to particular individuals had by this time arisen.138 David Harris Sacks showed in a remarkable essay139 how demands that the merchants of Bristol had made to the crown aimed at a general regulation. Private rights for all economic citizens should replace market privileges to particular corporations or possessors of patents that were granted by political power. For the Bristol merchants, and for those corpora-tions in London and other towns that did not enjoy royal favour, demands of this kind arose not only from their disadvantage in such access, but also from the fact that they (rightly or wrongly) believed they could compete successfully with the formerly leading corporations, if these lost the political support for their market position that they currently enjoyed. In the situation of a potential expansion of competition - in the 1620s, such an expansion had temporarily been permitted by the crown in both cloth production and certain sectors of overseas trade - Charles I's practice of granting monopolies was bound to be especially provocative. It is not insignificant that, in certain legal cases, a fundamental criticism of the crown's authority to favour corporations was developed already from the end of the sixteenth century (especially by Judge Edward Cook). Reproduction of the ruling estates In societies of the ancien-régime type, social positions were constituted by power to a more or less high degree. This was true from the first estate, to which in England only the king - or in case of female succession, the queen - belonged, right down to the poorest inhabitants of a local community. Their place in the world, too, was determined not simply by poverty, but additionally by the fact that authorities determined the difference between their position and the criminal way of life known as vagabondage. Politically sanctioned privileges and their incumbent duties were also bound up with social position - again to a very different degree. These, too, stretched from the privileging of local beggars as against foreign ones, up to the privilege of the lords who were invited to Parliament. Between these extremes lay, for example, the privilege of members of particular corporations to take precedence in the processions that were a feature of urban feast days. In the rules of precedence, i.e. the right to precede, the forms of social intercourse among nobles were increasingly given practical normative expression in the course of time. Precedence, in whatever form it might be expressed, was a display of social position. (Others for example were the dress appropriate for each particular estate, or - almost more important - their place in church.) Social position was a property of persons. By virtue of the political sanctioning of the social hierarchy, which existed in principle even if it was not always applied in each individual case, anyone could demand respect on the basis of their status, and indeed irrespective of whether they enjoyed personal esteem or were less rich then many members of a lower estate. These brief indications already suffice to show that there was no fundamental distinction between the politically regulated social hierarchy of ranks of nobility and the social hierarchy of non-nobles, in so far as the latter was also not determined simply from a material standpoint. The final historical dissolution of the structural significance of ranks of nobility for social status, therefore, did not result from the prevalence of status criteria that had been developed by members of the Third Estate under the ancien régime. The abolition of noble privileges rather meant the total abolition of the political sanctioning of social positions. It is only since this time that ‘social hierarchies' correspond to the notion of them developed by social theorists of later historical eras: they are (almost) exclusively the result of processes of social selection. These general considerations apply equally to the English ancien régime. In England, however, the social hierarchy was also in its upper ranks a hierarchy of possession. (Exceptions from this characteristic structure will be explained below.) This far-reaching coincidence between politically sanctioned social hierarchy and hierarchy of possession had three particular causes: the first was primogeniture, by which the transmission of (hereditary) noble titles and wealth was confined to the oldest surviving son. (The remaining children of a high noble thus sank into the gentry, if they did not manage an individual ascent into the high nobility.) This not only kept the families of the high nobil-ity small in number, but above all it maintained the great wealth of these families. In the course of time, the notion that the present bearers of such titles, whilst they could certainly enjoy their possession themselves, could not dispose of it freely, became an element (in part also laid down by law) of the socialisation strategies of this social estate. The second cause of the coinci-dence of status and possession hierarchies followed from the conviction of the English monarchs that great wealth justified the hope for ennoblement. If they conferred titles of nobility on individuals whose wealth did not correspond to their future rank, they then generally combined such a title with the grant of a landed property. The third and final reason resulted from the circumstance that after the constitution of the lower nobility into an estate and its appro-priation of local ruling power, the boundary between noble and non-noble in England continued to be determined largely without the direct intervention of the crown (on heraldry, see below). This did not mean, as might be supposed from the qualification of £40 annual income for public office, that the lower limit of the English gentry simply coincided with a certain amount of property (and the income resulting from this). For in a kingdom where the triumphal march of the hierarchy of possession had already begun in the age of feudalism, source of wealth remained decisive for social position under the ancien régime. But, among those whose wealth was derived from agricultural appropriation (or possession of office), the amount of wealth counted for much in England. This applied in a double respect: wealth meant candidacy for membership of the gentry; conversely, loss of wealth involved a more or less rapid social decline, right down to the loss of membership of the nobility altogether. In the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, three important structural changes took place in the social forms of the constitution and repro-duction of the ruling estates of England. These amounted to the dissolution of the notion of gentility, a concept which had expressed the unity of the nobility, and a redefinition of the boundary between lower nobles and non-nobles together with the formation of the 'squirearchy' (see the Bibliography for this concept). All these changes were a matter of developments effected by strat-egies of social advance or by modes of behaviour designed to obstruct the encroachment of social climbers into the privileged estates: social processes, therefore, that modified a social hierarchy structured by possession of privi-leges, and still sanctioned moreover by power. In outward appearance, how-ever, the very highest ranks of the social hierarchy would seem to have been scarcely affected by this process. For, in the period of the ancien régime under discussion here, these continued to be shaped to a very far-reaching degree by the direct practice of royal power. (As we shall show, the political room for exercise of this prerogative power was restricted in the later phases of the ancien régime.)”翻译为中文","output":"从整体上看，授予专利的做法更多地引发了“有”与“无”之间的冲突。在统治阶层内部，这些冲突最多是由对既定赞助模式的无视引燃的。然而，有时更广泛的公众也被卷入了专利争议中。 查尔斯一世授予“威斯敏斯特的肥皂制造商”专利所引起的抗议尤其值得关注。我从查尔斯·卡尔顿关于查尔斯一世的传记中获取了这一垄断争议的描述： 当政府动用皇家海军来阻止走私者规避国王授予的威斯敏斯特肥皂制造公司的垄断时，显得同样荒谬。该公司是一群女王的天主教徒朋友的幌子，他们在1631年被授权使用国内原材料如猪油，而不是进口的鱼油或鲸鱼油来制造肥皂，每磅以3便士的价格出售，向皇冠支付每吨4英镑的版税。这项垄断惹恼了许多人：旧的制造商……家庭主妇……和许多新教徒。因此，政府在市政厅举行了一次公开展示，由两名洗衣妇在伦敦市长、市议员、伦敦塔的上尉和他们的夫人们的注视下，在两个桶中洗涤和搓揉，以说服公众新的（并且改进的）天主教肥皂洗得一样好，而且比新教品牌起泡更多。然而，公众仍然持怀疑态度……[并且]在1637年 - 未能阻止内战的太晚 - 当坎特伯雷大主教说服国王从女王的天主教朋友那里撤回垄断权，并恢复到旧的新教公司，尽管版税翻倍至每吨8英镑时，英格兰的洗衣妇被允许回到她们祖先的泡沫中。 正如罗伯特·阿什顿所展示的，尤其是在伦敦，公司的特权化引发了与获得专利、许可证或税收权的商人之间的冲突。这不仅是特权持有者利用这些特权损害了竞争对手，他们很多时候也垄断了与皇冠的联系，并且仅在自己经济参与这些新专利的条件下才促成了新专利的购买。 在专利意味着对市场的有效干预时，经济竞争关系采取了政治派系的形式。这种情况在查尔斯一世政府暂时撤退后的1630年代再次授予（群体）专利时达到高潮，因为通过这种方式，皇冠可以节省对宫廷侍从的礼物费用，并希望为自己带来收入。然而，通过其偏袒和无视现有专利，国王政府设法在政治上疏远了其特许受益人。自伊丽莎白统治以来，尤其是在伦敦等城镇的大商人和制造商已经形成了某些群体，通过为宫廷供货，尤其是通过皇冠授予的专利和特许状，与皇家君主形成了战术性经济联盟——因此，例如甚至支持了1628-29年的财政政策——查尔斯一世的特权政策扰乱了这一环境。这项政策的结果是，1640年，国王找不到新的债主，伦敦首次在这场政治冲突开始以来站在了议会一边。 但是，“专利”不仅激起了此前受皇冠青睐者的反对。因为批评特定个人量身定制的经济规定的广泛批评的经济前提已经出现。大卫·哈里斯·萨克斯在一篇引人注目的文章中展示了布里斯托尔的商人向皇冠提出的要求，旨在进行一般性规定。对所有经济公民的私人权利应当取代被政治权力授予特定公司或专利持有者的市场特权。对布里斯托尔商人和伦敦及其他城镇未受皇室青睐的公司来说，这种要求不仅源于此类通道的不利地位，还因为他们（无论对错）相信，如果这些公司失去了他们目前享有的对其市场地位的政治支持，他们可以与前者领先的公司成功竞争。在潜在的竞争扩大的情况下——在1620年代，皇冠曾暂时允许纺织生产和某些海外贸易部门扩大竞争——查尔斯一世授予专利的做法必然特别具有挑衅性。值得注意的是，在某些法律案例中，对皇冠有利公司的权威进行了根本性批评，这已经从十六世纪末开始（特别是由法官爱德华·库克提出）。 统治阶层的再生产 在旧制度类型的社会中，社会地位在更或较少的程度上由权力构成。从属于第一等级的英格兰国王（或在女性继承的情况下，女王）直到一个地方社区的最贫困居民，这一点同样成立。他们在世界中的位置也不仅仅由贫穷决定，而且还由当局确定了他们的位置与被称为流浪生活方式之间的区别。与社会地位相关的政治制裁特权及其附带的职责也在不同程度上与之相关联——这也从保护当地乞丐对抗外来乞丐的特权，一直到被邀请参加议会的贵族的特权。在这些极端之间，例如，特定公司的成员在城市节日庆典中的游行中享有优先权的特权。在优先权规则中，即优先权，随着时间的推移，贵族之间的社交形式越来越多地在实践中得到规范性表达。无论以何种形式表达，优先权都是社会地位的展示。（例如，每个特定阶层适合的着装，或者——几乎更重要的是——他们在教堂中的位置。）社会地位是人的属性。由于政治制裁的社会等级结构原则上存在，即使它不总是在每个个案中应用，任何人都可以基于他们的地位要求尊重，而且无论他们是否享有个人尊重或比许多低阶层成员更富有。这些简要指示已经足以表明，在旧制度下，政治调节的社会等级制度与非贵族的社会等级之间没有根本区别，只要后者也不仅仅从物质角度决定。因此，贵族等级的结构性重要性对社会地位的最终历史解体，并不是源于旧制度下第三等级成员发展的地位标准的盛行。废除贵族特权意味着彻底废除对社会地位的政治制裁。自此之后，“社会等级”才符合后来历史时期的社会理论家们发展的观念：它们（几乎）完全是社会选择过程的结果。 这些一般性考虑同样适用于英格兰旧制度。然而，在英格兰，社会等级的上层也是财产等级。（以下将解释此特征结构的例外。）这种在政治制裁的社会等级和财产等级之间的高度重合有三个特定原因：第一是长子继承制，通过它，（世袭）贵族头衔和财富的传递仅限于最年长的幸存儿子。（高贵阶层的其他子女因而沦为平民贵族，如果他们没有实现个别的高贵阶层上升。）这不仅使得高贵阶层的家庭数量少，而且最重要的是维持这些家庭的巨大财富。随着时间的推移，这种观念成为这个社会阶层社会化策略的一个元素（部分也通过法律规定），即尽管现任头衔持有者当然可以享受他们的财富，但不能自由处置它。地位和财产等级重合的第二个原因源于英格兰君主的信念，即巨大的财富为封爵提供了希望。如果他们将爵位授予财富不符合其未来等级的个体，他们通常会将这样的头衔与土地财产的授予结合起来。第三个也是最后一个原因来自于这样的情况，即在低级贵族构成一个阶层并占有地方统治权力后，英格兰的贵族和平民之间的界限在很大程度上仍然在没有皇冠直接干预的情况下决定（关于纹章学，请见下文）。这并不意味着，正如可能从公职40英镑年收入的资格要求所假设的那样，英格兰平民贵族的下限仅与一定数量的财产（及由此产生的收入）相吻合。因为在一个封建制时代就已经开始财产等级胜利进军的王国中，社会地位在旧制度下仍然由财富来源决定。但是，在那些财富来源于农业占有（或职位拥有）的人中，英格兰的财富数量占很大比重。这在双重方面适用：财富意味着成为平民贵族的候选人；相反，财富的损失涉及到较快或较慢的社会下降，直到完全失去贵族身份。 在十六世纪和十七世纪期间，英格兰统治阶层的社会形式和再生产发生了三个重要的结构变化。这些变化导致了对“绅士”概念的解体，这一概念曾体现了贵族的统一，并对低级贵族和非贵族之间的界限以及“乡绅”（见参考书目）的形成进行了重新定义。所有这些变化都是通过社会提升策略或旨在阻止社会攀升者侵入特权阶层的行为模式实现的发展：因此，这些是通过特权占有和权力制裁的社会等级结构修改的社会过程。然而，从外表上看，社会等级的最高层似乎几乎未受此过程影响。因为，在此讨论的旧制度时期，这些继续在很大程度上由皇家权力的直接实践塑造。（正如我们将展示的，旧制度后期阶段的王权特权行使空间受到了限制。）"},{"instruction":"请将“It was not only deserving officials, but also courtiers able to gain the mon-arch's favour in other ways, who were rewarded with titles and estates up to the Revolution, and again under the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy. For the conferring of ranks of nobility (along with their material support) was as much one of the prerogatives of the crown as was the right to raise someone to the knightly estate. (In time of war, the latter was also devolved to the crown's commanders in the field.) For the peerage (i.e. the high nobility of England), as well as the baronetcy (introduced in 1611) and the orders of knighthood, the English crown distributed noble ranks and along with these social positions. If Henry VIII or Edward VI granted new titles as a means to win political support, or if the early Stuarts resorted to a regular sale of noble titles out of fiscal considerations, this had just as direct effects on the structure of the nobility as did the inflation of the orders of knighthood that was started by Elizabeth's commanders - above all Essex - and continued on a large scale by the early Stuarts. The crown decided on new accessions to the high nobility; it secured the continuance of an old name by reconferring a title on relatives of a family that had disappeared, and secured the survival of others by the abolition of ‘attainder' (condemnation in trial for treason). Strategies of the nobility had an effect on the maintenance of wealth. But since even a high noble rank gave no protection against the many dangers with which life was beset, the political strategies of queens and kings, just like those of noble families, were upset time and again by the failure of biological reproduction.140 Up till the Reformation, a far-reaching coincidence of noble rank and pos-session marked both the high nobility and the lords spiritual. After the Ref-ormation, whilst the archbishops and bishops kept their seats in the House of Lords, only a few princes of the church were still in a position to conduct a household appropriate to their rank. But since under the English ancien régime great wealth and a corresponding mode of life had become benchmarks of high noble rank, the relative impoverishment of the religious lords brought with it a blow to their social position. This development was not reversed by the considerable influence that particular bishops obtained in the early Stuart period. The result was that it became easier at this time for sons of the lower gentry, or even sons of peasants, to rise up in the church hierarchy. This in turn reinforced the devaluation of the social position of lords of the church that was already under way. There thus arose a difference between noble rank and social position that is otherwise rather untypical for English conditions. Direct sanctioning of social hierarchy by power in England remained con-fined to the higher nobility. The crown could certainly influence ascent within an estate by its practice of patronage, but the structurally decisive factor was the socially selective practice of members of the privileged estates. Especially significant here is the effectiveness of such practice on the de facto perpetuation of an incompatibility between commerce and membership of the nobility. As distinct from other societies of the ancien régime, this incom-patibility was not fixed in England by laws of derogation (i.e. regulations that threatened the loss of noble status if they were breached). Social discrimination, however, was all the more effective according to M.L. Bush.141 This lasted right down to the nineteenth century, whereas in France foreign trade was already exempted from the derogation regulations in the seventeenth century. Stone and Fawtier Stone have shown that a view long prevailing among historians, to the effect that the involvement of a large number of younger sons in commercial enterprises led to a close tie between nobility and commerce, was certainly not true for the higher nobility.142 As far as the lower nobility or gentry were concerned, they too managed to exclude even overseas traders for several centuries. This practice led to a second departure of social hierarchy from hierarchy of possession, though one that was completely different from the case of the lords spiritual. The exclusion of rich merchants in overseas trade from candidacy to nobility corresponded to the socially dominant criteria of social position. In other words, their wealth gave many families of the mercantile bourgeoisie a material position comparable with families of the upper gentry or even baronets, but the source of their wealth, according to the prevailing criteria of selection practice, ascribed them precisely the status they already had, that of non-nobles. Conversely, most members of the rich mercantile bourgeoisie in England did not attempt modes of behaviour that would have made them candidates for integration into the aristocracy (see below). In so far as they did purchase landed properties (generally in close proximity to London), they did not thereby give up their connection to the world of trade, but 'derogated' from modes of behaviour that would have been appropriate to a landed noble. In the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the crown sought to extend its authority over conferring social rank to the lower gentry. Whilst it did not claim to determine membership of the gentry as such, it did do so for rise into the so-called 'armigerous gentry'. By raising a man to the rank of knight, the crown already conferred formal confirmation of advance within his estate. In 1484 an office of heraldry was established, for the purpose of expanding this authority. Heralds were to control the justification to bear a family coat of arms. (This had traditionally served as the hallmark of some-one's 'own weapons' - and thus to signal that armed men belonged to a par-ticular lord.) From the mid-sixteenth century at the latest, visitations of the heralds to the provinces are documented.143 But the heralds only intervened against the most flagrant abuse. They allowed a 'noble lifestyle' to serve as justification to bear a coat of arms, without seeking to define this more pre-cisely. In its administrative practice, the College of Heralds did not develop as an instance of administering the royal prerogative, but simply as a kind of public office in matters of nobility: decisions of the heralds were not pro-claimed 'in the name of the king (or queen)', but simply with respect to the power of office granted to the heralds.144 The development of the College of Heralds shows that the crown could no longer do more than formally confirm the results of a selection practice within the estate. For the long duration of the ancien régime, the English nobility retained the power of defining the preconditions for access to the nobility, and for ascent within the gentry. The most important expression of this power was the development of a notion of social qualification for particular public offices: the minimum precondition was an adequate income from landed property. Income from office was also acceptable. (There were regional variations in relation to the level of income seen as necessary, and therefore in relation to the estate assignment of certain groups of proprietors.) The property qualification had to be supplemented, however, by the social integration of a family into the society of landed nobility. Only if the stratum of nobility that a family sought to join accepted and returned invitations, and did not seek to prevent marriage between its own sons and daughters and those of the new family, could this see itself as belonging. What decisively confirmed membership was the head of the family being proposed by the heads of other noble families for an office befitting his new status. As against the situation in France, it cannot therefore be said in England that attainment of a particular office automatically conferred noble rank, since in England certain offices were only attainable if the social position corresponding to them had already been acquired. It was long taken for granted by scholars that the absence of formalised estate barriers to even the highest offices made access to these easier, and thus ascent into the nobility and within this estate. More detailed empirical studies, however, have shown how the opposite was the case.145 To this extent, however, ascent into the lower nobility was comparatively less problematic than the phase of ‘nobility in waiting' which in eighteenth-century France had to last at least four generations, in the view of the older noble families, though in certain circumstances it could be accomplished in a single generation. In England, once a family was accepted by the local gentry, they belonged to it right away. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw a considerable numerical expan-sion of the gentry. This happened by a dual process: an increase in successful individual ascent, and the collective appropriation of certain privileges by the highest status group of the non-nobility that had previously been reserved to the nobility. The crown contributed to the success of individual strategies of ascent, not least by the sale of the church lands that it had expropriated in the wake of the Reformation. Many a yeoman (on this concept, see the Bibliography) was now able to build a house whose size and fittings proclaimed his hope to be counted among the gentry, and many lawyers and officials from the towns acquired along with a landed property the opportunity to present themselves as equals to the families of the landed nobility. Since the second half of the six-teenth century, there was, besides this individual ascent along the traditional path, also a kind of collective appropriation of the status symbols of the nobil-ity by non-nobles, i.e. by families that to a large extent retained their former style of life and did not seek acceptance by the society of landed nobles. They thus to a certain extent entered into the privileged sphere of the nobility, but without accepting its criteria of definition. This aspect is somewhat concealed in the notion of 'pseudo-gentry' commonly used among historians, since this suggests that a more or less well-constituted group of gentry was expanded by that of 'pseudo-gentry'. But though it does indeed seem that any urban bourgeois, once he was addressed by his fellow bourgeois as 'gentleman', experienced this as confirmation of his own advance into (almost) the world of the nobles, the justification for this pride must be somewhat reduced from a later perspective. For the influx of lawyers and scholars, brewery owners, bankers and eventually even merchants into the world of gentlemen, meant from a structural point of view that the former dividing line between noble and non-noble was weakened, rather than simply signalling the advance of indi-vidual non-nobles.”翻译为中文","output":"直到革命期间，再次在斯图亚特王朝复辟期间，不仅是那些有功的官员，还有能够以其他方式赢得君主恩宠的朝臣也以头衔和领地为奖赏。授予贵族头衔（连同其物质支持）与赋予骑士等级一样，都是皇冠的特权之一。（在战时，后者也转交给了皇冠的战地指挥官。）对于贵族（即英格兰的高级贵族）、1611年引入的准男爵头衔以及骑士团订单，英格兰的皇冠分发了贵族等级和随之而来的社会地位。如果亨利八世或爱德华六世授予新头衔作为赢得政治支持的手段，或者早期的斯图亚特君主出于财政考虑定期销售贵族头衔，这对贵族结构的影响就像伊丽莎白的指挥官——尤其是埃塞克斯——开始的骑士团订单的膨胀及早期斯图亚特君主大规模继续进行的做法一样直接。 皇冠决定高级贵族的新加入者；通过将头衔重新授予已消失家族的亲属，保障了旧名字的延续，并通过废除“褫夺权”（即叛国审判中的定罪）确保了其他家族的存续。贵族的策略影响了财富的维护。但由于即使是高贵族头衔也无法保护人免受生活中许多危险的侵扰，女王和国王的政治策略，就像贵族家族的策略一样，由于生物学再生产的失败而一次又一次地受到挫折。 直至宗教改革，高级贵族和精神领袖的地位与拥有的财富高度一致。宗教改革之后，尽管大主教和主教保留了在上议院的席位，但只有少数教会王子仍能维持与其地位相符的家庭。但由于在英格兰旧制度下，巨大的财富和相应的生活方式已成为高级贵族地位的标志，宗教领袖的相对贫困给他们的社会地位带来了打击。这一发展并没有因早期斯图亚特时期个别主教获得的相当大的影响力而逆转。其结果是，低级贵族的儿子，甚至是农民的儿子，在教会等级中的上升变得更容易。这反过来又加强了已经在进行中的教会领袖社会地位的贬值。因此产生了贵族等级与社会地位之间的差异，这在英格兰条件下相当不典型。 英格兰社会等级结构的直接权力制裁仅限于高级贵族。皇冠当然可以通过其赞助做法影响阶层内的晋升，但结构性决定性因素是特权阶层成员的社会选择性做法。 特别值得注意的是这种做法对商业与贵族身份不相容性的实际延续的有效性。与旧制度下的其他社会不同，这种不相容性在英格兰并没有通过贬损法（即如果违反则威胁失去贵族地位的规定）来固定。然而，根据M.L. Bush的说法，社会歧视效果更加明显。这一直持续到19世纪，而在法国，外贸已在17世纪被豁免于贬损法规定之外。斯通和福蒂尔·斯通已经表明，历史学家长期流行的观点，即大量年轻子弟参与商业企业导致贵族与商业的紧密联系，并不适用于高级贵族。 就低级贵族或贵族而言，他们也设法排除了几个世纪的海外商人。这种做法导致社会等级结构与财产等级结构的第二次偏离，尽管这与教会领袖的情况完全不同。排除海外贸易中的富商获得贵族资格的做法与社会上占主导地位的社会地位标准相符。换句话说，他们的财富使许多商业资产阶级家庭在物质上与上层贵族甚至准男爵家庭相当，但根据当时主导的选择准则，他们的财富来源确切地指定了他们已有的非贵族地位。相反，英格兰的大多数富有的商业资产阶级成员并没有尝试使他们有资格融入贵族的行为方式（见下文）。在他们确实购买了土地财产的情况下（通常靠近伦敦），他们并没有放弃与贸易世界的联系，而是背离了适合地主贵族的行为方式。 在十六世纪和十七世纪期间，皇冠试图将其授予社会地位的权力扩展到低级贵族。虽然它并没有声称决定贵族的会员资格，但它确实对晋升到所谓的“持盾贵族”做出了规定。通过将一个人提升为骑士，皇冠已经正式确认了他在自己阶层内的进步。1484年建立了一家纹章局，目的是扩大这项权力。纹章官要控制承载家族纹章的合理性。（这传统上用作某人“自己的武器”的标志——从而表明武装人员属于特定的领主。）从最迟十六世纪中叶开始，纪录了纹章官对省份的视察。但是纹章官只对最明显的滥用进行干预。他们允许“贵族式的生活方式”作为承载纹章的理由，而不试图对此进行更精确的定义。在行政实践中，纹章局并未发展为管理皇家特权的实例，而仅仅是作为贵族事务的一种公共办公室：纹章局的决定并非以国王（或女王）的名义宣布，而仅仅是关于授予纹章官的职权。 纹章局的发展表明，皇冠不能做的不仅仅是正式确认阶层内选择做法的结果。在旧制度持续的漫长岁月里，英格兰贵族保留了定义获得贵族资格条件和在贵族内部晋升的权力。这种权力最重要的体现是对特定公职社会资格的观念的发展：最低前提条件是来自土地财产的足够收入。来自职位的收入也是可以接受的。（关于收入水平的要求，因此对某些财产持有者群体的阶层分配，存在地区差异。）财产资格必须由一个家庭融入地主贵族社会补充完成。只有当一个家庭寻求加入的贵族阶层接受并回访邀请，并且不试图阻止其自己的儿女与新家庭的儿女结婚时，这个家庭才能视自己为归属。决定性地确认会员资格的是，家庭的负责人被其他贵族家庭的负责人提名担任适合其新地位的职务。与法国的情况相对，因此不能说在英格兰达到特定职位自动授予贵族地位，因为在英格兰某些职位只有在已经获得相应社会地位的情况下才能获得。学者长期以为，缺乏形式化的阶层壁垒甚至对最高职位的访问更容易，因此更容易晋升为贵族并在这个阶层内晋升。然而，更详细的实证研究显示，情况正好相反。 然而，在一定程度上，晋升为低级贵族相对来说问题较小，与18世纪法国贵族观点中必须持续至少四代的“等待贵族”阶段相反，虽然在某些情况下可以在一代内完成。在英国，一旦一个家庭被当地贵族接受，他们立即属于它。 十六和十七世纪见证了贵族的数量显著扩大。这是通过两个双重过程实现的：成功个体晋升的增加，以及最高非贵族地位群体对之前保留给贵族的某些特权的集体占有。 皇冠为个体晋升策略的成功做出了贡献，尤其是通过出售宗教改革后征用的教会土地。许多佃农（关于这个概念，见参考书目）现在能够建造一座体现其希望被列入贵族之列的房屋，许多来自城镇的律师和官员通过土地财产获得了与地主贵族家庭平起平坐的机会。自十六世纪下半叶以来，除了沿传统路径的个体晋升外，非贵族家庭还以某种方式通过集体占有贵族的地位象征，即这些家庭在很大程度上保留了原先的生活方式，并没有寻求被地主贵族社会接受。因此他们在一定程度上进入了贵族的特权范围，但没有接受其定义标准。这个方面在历史学家通常使用的“伪贵族”的概念中有些掩盖，因为这暗示了一个或多或少构成的贵族群体被“伪贵族”扩大。但尽管确实看起来，任何一旦被他的同胞市民称为“绅士”的城市资产阶级成员，都将这视为自己进入（几乎）贵族世界的确认，但从后来的视角看，这种自豪感的理由必须有所降低。因为律师和学者、酒厂老板、银行家，甚至商人进入绅士世界，从结构角度来看，意味着以前划分贵族和非贵族的界限被弱化，而不仅仅是标志着个别非贵族的晋升。"},{"instruction":"请将“The increase in the number of gentlemen - an inflationary one to many eyes - provoked defensive reactions from this estate, who feared it would lead to a kind of restructuring of the strata of nobility. Up to now, the dividing line between noble and non-noble ran along the lower boundary of 'mere gentlemen'. This boundary - though never formally determined - appeared sufficiently decisive in that, until the early seventeenth century, 'gentility' had signified an understanding of the unity of the nobility. From rich princes down to simple landed gentry, members of the nobility were comprehensively described as 'gentlemen' according to Harrison.146 But when everyone who could possibly claim it appropriated the nobilising tag of 'esquire', and the abolition of clothing regulations at the start of the seventeenth century made their efforts to describe themselves as 'gentlemen' quite legal (not to mention the opportunities that this offered their ladies), members of the higher ranks of nobility challenged the unity of all gentlemen. By word and deed they widened the social distance between themselves and plain gentlemen that had already been present to a degree. In this way, they left the former lower gentry somewhat in the lurch, and threw them together with the new plain gentlemen into the same social pot - by their language and social practice. These defence strategies were reinforced by the development of models of behaviour that marked out a new dividing line. This ran - in simple terms - between 'parish' and 'county'. The reference to administrative units is not accidental. For nothing was altered by the possibility of advance within the estate as a social qualification for particular offices. 'County' meant a family whose male members would be considered for offices at the county level, which was the case when their social contacts with families already accepted as qualified were firmly established. The increase in numbers of plain gentlemen led to the development of strategies designed to make advance beyond a certain level within the estate that much harder. A brewer might well call himself 'esquire' and even buy a landed property, but access to county families would still be barred to him. In principle, the higher ranks of gentry still remained open. In practice, however, only those families of the lower gentry could profit from this possibility who had steadily improved their social position over several generations. Social ascent was prepared by the acquisition of wealth: through marriage above all, though also - if more slowly - by the systematic exploitation of all opportunities for appropriation linked to the possession of land. A request for integration into the circle of county gentry was proclaimed by the construction or purchase of a landed property and the development of a generous and hospitable lifestyle.147 The ascent was sanctioned by the award of office at the county level, and finally - depending on the practice of the monarch of the day, and on access to influential courtiers - in the short or long run by conferment of knighthood or a hereditary title. Besides this slow ascent of local gentry families from parish to county, there was also a move sideways into the county gentry. This was open to all holders of offices under the crown. Occupation of these was indeed generally reserved for those who were already regarded as belonging to established families at the county level, yet under the Tudors for example, powerful new dynasties of great nobles were created from families who did not already belong to the higher gentry or the lower ranks of the peerage. By this widening of the social distance between themselves and the plain gentlemen (those of the towns in particular), the ‘armigerous gentry' drew closer in a certain respect to the higher nobility. In the course of the phase of the ancien régime under consideration here, in fact, the higher-status groups (ranks) of the gentry, together with the peerage, came to form a far-reaching common self-conception and corresponding forms of behaviour. This habitus of the aristocracy attained a cultural dominance in England and Great Britain, outlasting all political and social changes of the second half of the nineteenth century almost unscathed. It is still effective today. The possibility of developing a habitus that embraced the higher gentry and the peerage arose from three structural preconditions, the first of which was the far-reaching coincidence of the hierarchies of possession and status (including hierarchy in the ranks of nobility). Whereas, in seventeenth-century France, families of the noblesse de robe could be much richer than families from the old noblesse d'épée, yet remain far below them in rank, in England great wealth - from a socially acceptable source - played a considerable role in determining candidacy for rise through knighthood, via the title of baronet, and on to eventual elevation to the peerage. Hereditary titles could, of course, only be conferred by the crown, but since the exclusion practices of families in the higher status positions of the gentry (those in line for the peerage) were not sanctioned politically, conflicts over the extent and form of centralised power scarcely touched the reproduction of the ruling estate. This meant, however, that advance into the squirearchy remained open in principle to every landed gentleman in so far as he ‘and his house' met the requirements of wealth and habitus laid down for the higher and highest nobility. A further precondition for the cultural and social melting together of the higher gentry and peerage lay in the conditions for the political power of the lords. In England, too, political struggles took the form of court intrigues. Lasting political influence, however, already presupposed anchorage in one or more counties (for more on this point see below). Neither their practice of rule nor their mode of life made the English peers into court nobles in the literal sense that had characterised the existence of the higher nobility in France since the reign of Louis XIV. The formation of a habitus including the squirearchy finally presupposed the already described disappearance of the difference between the appropria-tion practices of the higher nobility and the gentry. Since appropriation by armed force had lost significance even for the higher nobility, the differences of interest between peerage and higher gentry shrank accordingly. The devel-opment of a common ideal of nobility that this made possible led to the cul-tural transformation of the notion of honour.148 The higher social value of an officer's commission in the Guards regiments as against other ways of earning money open to the younger sons of the nobil-ity, just like the social obligation to duel in the case of an injury to one's honour, involved a notion of honour oriented to the conception of the knight as individual warrior. But, whereas the traditional notion of honour made the individual knight the decisive instance, and even founded a right of resistance to the king, the transformed notion of honour of the English nobility was ori-ented far more towards service to the crown. This adaptation of the notion of honour to the changed conditions of mate-rial and social reproduction of the nobility also facilitated the cultural repro-cessing of the Reformation by the nobility. If the moralisation of possession of rule was initially promoted by members of the gentry, this notion was now integrated into the common ideal of nobility. Also connected to this is the dissolution of those requirements that were made of a noble household in the age of feudalism and the early phase of the ancien régime by the ideal of ‘hospitality'. The notion of ‘household' had signified above all an obligation towards vassals and later towards retainers under private contract, but ‘hospitality', which became the norm for the nobility particularly in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century,149 was extended to anyone, and especially the poor of the community. This kind of hospitality was also decisive for publication of the claim to count as a county gentleman. For, in the sixteenth and even seventeenth century, hospitality offered one of the most important ways of acquiring a social reputation. Among Puritan families in the higher nobility, this was also an integral component of a seriously Christian practice of life.150 This behavioural ideal became possible not least through the way that appropriation was now organised. Since families of the ruling estates often leased their land to large farmers, it was the latter who confronted the peasants as direct representatives of the system of exploitation, whilst the owners could be seen as generous, especially if, on occasion, they prevented the expulsion of small peasants who had fallen behind with their payments. That it was often useful for them to be viewed in this way can be ascribed, on the one hand, to the fact that the development of paternalist practices of rule was necessary in view of the lack of a developed local police power; at the same time, however, this code of behaviour, advertised and in part actually realised, must be taken seriously as a collective definition of the estate's self-conception. To this extent, hospitality also served to demonstrate membership of the effective lords of the land. If the purchase of a new landed property did not lead to the practice of hospitality, this to a certain extent signalled a renunciation of integration into the local ruling circles. (That there were purchases of this kind - for example as a home for retirement or simply relaxation, is shown by L. Stone and J. Fawtier Stone.151) A certain education for members of the ruling estates also developed along with the habitus characteristic of hospitality. Many eldest sons in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries attended university for a time, or one of the Inns of Court. A basic education was even customary for daughters. Younger sons often received an education that would give them access to an office or a legal practice. Habitus, i.e. particular perspectives and models of behaviour that were cul-turally defined quite precisely, became the most important criterion for access to high position in the noble hierarchy, at least after the size of property. With the exception of the eldest sons of peers, there was no politically sanctioned guarantee that members of the aristocracy would retain their social position. On the contrary, the younger sons of nobles invariably tended to sink below the status of their fathers. Only some success in the process of social selection (favoured of course by origin) could help them to a social position that matched that of their eldest brother. Strategic opportunities for daughters were restricted to the choice of marriage candidates. Although the importance of wealth and habitus was at least as great in the reproduction of the English nobility as that of inherited privilege directly tied to the person, it is analytically advisable to consider the entire English nobility as a single estate. It is true that apart from the family heads and eldest sons of the peerage (a total that rarely reached more than a hundred), the English nobles individually possessed little privilege over and above their appropria-tion power as landlords - and in estate terms this was gradually neutralised. Collectively, however, they held considerable parts of the generalised power in their possession.”翻译为中文","output":"绅士数量的增加——在许多人看来这是一种通货膨胀——引发了这个阶层的防御性反应，他们担心这将导致贵族阶层的某种重组。直到现在，贵族与非贵族之间的界线沿着“仅仅是绅士”的下界划定。这个界线——尽管从未正式确定——在直到十七世纪初期，\\"绅士身份\\"意味着贵族统一性的理解上显得足够明确。哈里森称，从富有的王子到简朴的地主贵族，贵族成员被普遍描述为“绅士”。但当每个可能声称如此的人都占有了贵族化的标签“乡绅”，并且十七世纪初取消了服装规定使他们努力将自己描述为“绅士”变得合法化时（更不用提这为他们的女士提供的机会），高级贵族阶层对所有绅士的统一性提出了挑战。他们通过言语和行为扩大了自己与普通绅士之间已有一定程度的社会距离。通过这种方式，他们在某种程度上遗弃了以前的低级贵族，并将他们与新的普通绅士一起扔进了相同的社会大熔炉中——通过他们的语言和社会实践。加强这些防御策略的是行为模式的发展，画出了新的界线。简单来说，这条界线在“教区”与“郡”之间。提到行政单位并非偶然。对特定职位的社会资格的晋升可能性并未发生改变。\\"郡\\"意味着一个家庭的男性成员将被考虑担任郡级职位，这在他们的社会联系与已被认定为合格的家庭牢固建立时发生。普通绅士数量的增加导致了旨在使在阶层内超过某一水平的晋升变得更加困难的策略的发展。一个酿酒商或许自称为“乡绅”并购买了土地财产，但他仍然无法获得进入郡级家庭的通道。原则上，高级贵族阶层仍然是开放的。然而，实际上，只有那些在几代人中稳步提升社会地位的低级贵族家庭才能从这种可能性中获益。 社会晋升是通过财富的积累来准备的：首先是通过婚姻，尽管也有较慢的方式—通过系统地利用与拥有土地相关的所有占有机会。请求融入郡级贵族圈子是通过购买或建造土地财产以及发展出一种慷慨好客的生活方式来宣告的。晋升通过在郡一级获得职位得到认可，最终——取决于当时君主的实践和获得有影响力的朝臣的通道——在短期或长期内通过授予骑士头衔或世袭头衔。 除了地方贵族家庭从教区到郡的缓慢晋升外，还有向郡级贵族横向移动的途径。这向所有皇冠下的官员开放。这些职位确实通常保留给那些已被视为属于郡级家庭的成熟家族，但例如在都铎王朝，从不属于高级贵族或贵族低阶的家族中创建了强大的新贵族王朝。 通过加大与普通绅士（特别是城镇居民）之间的社会距离，\\"持盾贵族\\"在某种程度上向高级贵族拉近。实际上，在此阶段的旧制度考虑中，贵族阶层的高级群体（等级）连同贵族，形成了一种广泛的共同自我认识和相应的行为形式。这种贵族习惯在英格兰和大不列颠取得了文化主导地位，几乎完好无损地经历了十九世纪下半叶的所有政治和社会变革。它在今天仍然有效。 形成包括高级贵族和贵族在内的习惯，源于三个结构性前提条件，其一是财产等级和地位等级（包括贵族内部的等级）的高度一致。 在十七世纪的法国，法官贵族的家庭可能比老贵族更富有，但在等级上远远低于他们，而在英格兰，来自社会可接受来源的巨大财富在决定晋升候选人——通过骑士爵位、准男爵头衔，最终可能晋升为贵族——中扮演了重要角色。 世袭头衔当然只能由皇冠授予，但由于高级贵族家族的排斥做法（那些排队等待贵族头衔的家族）没有得到政治制裁，对中央权力的范围和形式的冲突几乎未触及统治阶层的再生产。然而，这意味着进入乡绅阶层原则上对每个地主绅士都是开放的，只要他“和他的家”满足对高级和最高贵族制定的财富和习惯要求。 高级贵族和贵族文化和社会融合的另一个前提条件是贵族的政治权力条件。在英格兰，政治斗争也采取了宫廷阴谋的形式。然而，持久的政治影响力已经预设了在一个或多个郡的基础上（更多关于这一点见下文）。他们的统治实践和生活方式并没有使英格兰的贵族成为字面意义上的宫廷贵族，这一点自路易十四统治以来就是法国高级贵族存在的特点。 最后，贵族的习惯形成预设了高级贵族和贵族的占有实践之间差异的消失。由于即使是对高级贵族来说，通过武力占有的重要性也已经消失，贵族与高级贵族之间的利益差异相应缩小。这使得形成共同的贵族理想成为可能，从而导致荣誉观念的文化转变。 军官在卫队团的任职地位高于贵族的年轻子弟可选择的其他赚钱方式，以及在荣誉受损时的决斗社会义务，涉及到以个体战士的观念为导向的荣誉观。但是，传统的荣誉观念使得个体骑士成为决定性实例，甚至建立了对国王的抵抗权，而英格兰贵族的转变后荣誉观更多地面向为皇冠服务。 荣誉观念的适应改变了贵族的物质和社会再生产条件，也促进了贵族对宗教改革的文化处理。如果统治的道德化最初是由贵族成员推动的，那么这一观念现在被纳入了贵族的共同理想中。这也与封建时代和旧制度早期阶段对贵族家庭的“好客”理想提出的要求的解散有关。 “家庭”概念主要意味着对附庸的义务，后来对私人合同下的仆人的义务，“好客”特别是在十六世纪晚期和十七世纪早期成为贵族的规范，扩展到所有人，尤其是社区的穷人。这种好客也是宣称算作郡级绅士身份的决定性因素。因为在十六世纪甚至十七世纪，好客提供了获得社会声望的最重要方式之一。在高级贵族的清教徒家庭中，这也是认真基督教生活实践的一个组成部分。 这种行为理想不仅通过现在组织占有的方式成为可能。由于统治阶层的家庭经常将他们的土地租给大农场主，后者作为剥削制度的直接代表面对农民，而所有者如果偶尔阻止拖欠付款的小农民被驱逐，就可以被视为慷慨的，尤其是在这种行为对他们有用时，这可以归因于缺乏发达的地方警力的情况下发展家长式统治做法的必要性；同时，这种行为准则的宣传和部分实际实现，必须被认真看作是作为对该阶层自我认识的集体定义。在这个意义上，好客还用于展示土地有效统治者的身份。如果购买新的土地财产并未导致好客的实践，这在某种程度上表明了放弃融入当地统治圈子的意图。 随着好客特有的习性的发展，统治阶层成员的某种教育也随之发展。十六世纪和十七世纪的许多长子曾经上过大学或法学院之一。女儿们也通常接受基础教育。年轻的儿子们经常接受能让他们获得职位或法律实践的教育。 习性，即特定的视角和行为模式被精确地文化定义，成为进入贵族等级高位的最重要标准，至少在财产规模之后。除了贵族的长子外，没有政治制裁保证贵族成员会保持他们的社会地位。相反，贵族的年轻子弟总是倾向于降低他们父亲的地位。只有在社会选择过程中的一些成功（当然受到出身的支持）才能帮助他们获得与长兄相匹配的社会地位。女儿的战略机会则局限于选择婚姻对象。 尽管财富和习性的重要性在英格兰贵族的再生产中至少与直接与个人绑定的世袭特权一样大，但分析上建议将整个英格兰贵族视为一个单一阶层。的确，除了贵族家族的家长和长子（总数很少超过一百人）外，英格兰的贵族个体几乎没有比他们作为地主的占有权力更多的特权——并且从阶层角度来看，这逐渐被中和。然而，他们作为一个集体，仍拥有相当多的通用权力。"},{"instruction":"请将“The estate character of office power at the parish level, for its part, became more restricted in so far as practices of exclusion were increasingly directed against the entire poor and no longer against well-to-do peasants and large farmers. (A development that intensified from the second half of the sev-enteenth century, if with certain regional differences.) In place of exclusive estate participation in the local practice of generalised power, there emerged at the parish level rather a structure of participation governed by property and class interests. At the county level, however, the estate criteria of selection continued undiminished. In this way, members of the squirearchy secured favourable conditions for their practices of appropriation and their power to define the structures of good order. 'Good order' Only when changes in the world destroyed those notions of order in which a renovator was condemned as a heretic, a man in rebellion against the will of God, did change in the content of good order come irrevocably into debate. Of the contemporary conceptions of God and the world, a good life and ‘good rule', the only aspect that is relevant here is that bearing on conflicts over the maintenance of old notions of order and the introduction of new ones. In this connection - as always in times of far-reaching change - the groups upholding competing notions of order were not identical with the ‘authorities' on the one hand and the governed (or lower orders) on the other. Even among those who actually or potentially participated in the practice of rule, there were diverging conceptions of what made for good order and with what methods this could best be maintained or established. Before we turn to these differences, the first thing to note is that there were some definitions of good order that very many men and women accepted as unchallengeable in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. We can con-clude from traditional models of behaviour and formulations in the context of protests, that this prevailing opinion was often shared even by those who according to Thomas Smith were ‘only embraced in the common wealth in so far as they are to be ruled'152 - in other words, day-labourers, poor peasants, small traders, artisans, women and children. We have good reason to suppose that the great majority of these shared the view that everyone should honour God and be subject to the king or queen, likewise servants and apprentices to their masters, children to their parents and women to their menfolk. In the event of a woman inheriting the kingdom, a duchy or earldom, the prevailing opinion made exceptions, because in this case the decisive thing was not age or sex, but the ‘blood' that had brought them into the world.153 Good order was conceived as a hierarchy, and its maintenance was seen as possible only if every person had a master. To describe someone as ‘master-less' under the ancien régime was to ascribe to them every kind of ill-discipline. This commandment of subjection to a master embraced everyone, even the most powerful nobles. With the growth in population and the changed economic and social forms of profitable exploitation of landed property (not universal, but decisive in many regions), ‘masterlessness' became a constant problem for those authori-ties who had the task of establishing order and the means to achieve it. Views differed as to the methods that were required for this. And here we are already in the midst of the differing conceptions of the content and strategy of ‘good order'. David Underdown has summed up the main tendencies of public-order policy in the following way: on the one hand, an orientation to tradition and custom, to forms of collaboration and the notion of a ‘harmonic' vertical soci-ety, and on the other hand, the attempt to achieve a moral reform(ation), to promote individualism and personal responsibility.154 As far as public-order strategies are concerned, the former tendency was directed towards achieving social stability by maintaining a quite definite structure anchored in custom. Public-order policy should therefore be directed to preventing change as far as possible. The other strategic position was oriented to dealing with the social consequences of change. Stability was understood here in a more 'formal' sense, i.e. as securing rule, but not particular cultural and social forms. Simple schemata that ascribe different conceptions of order to representative social groups or institutions of rule are unsuccessful. For there were cultural conflicts in which estate differences and class antagonisms found expression, as well as conflicts between the more Puritan and more traditionally oriented members of the ruling estates. These did indeed partly coincide with the con-flict (to be explained below) between 'court' and 'country', but they were also overlaid by struggles over the actual extent of centralised authority. Finally, there were also significant regional differences. For depending on the form of production and settlement, the lower orders held more or less persistently to old conceptions of order, while their structures of communication gave them greater or lesser ability to defend these.155 To speak of differences between conceptions and strategies of public-order policy only makes analytical sense if the generalisation of rule has reached a certain point, so that generalised rule is no longer confined to fiscal appropria-tion and the prevention of internal war. This was the case in England at least from the second half of the sixteenth century. In connection with the strategies for politically implementing the Reforma-tion and improving the organisation of armed force, monarchical rule became both more extensive and more intensive. It was not that the territorial lords of the time were dispossessed (the abolition of the previously autonomous administration in the episcopal seats of Ely, Durham and Hexham in 1536 is rather untypical of the general developmental trend), but some 'gaps' in the former practice of rule were filled in. One of these gaps was spatial. For up to the Reformation, the validity of secular law stopped at religious 'sanctuaries'. Any man or woman of whatever station could escape pursuit by the authorities by flight to a sanctuary. The abolition of sanctuary meant the political sanctioning of practices that would previously have been seen as a monstrous sin. (As in many cases, it is necessary with the abolition of sanctuary to distinguish between the revo-lutionising of the legal situation and the persistence of modes of behaviour, which to some extent remain down to the present day). A further 'gap' in generalised rule, and a far more significant one, was increasingly abolished in the course of the sixteenth century and the first decades of the seventeenth. In so far as the retinues of nobles grew rarer and smaller, there gradually ended the private organisation of armed force and, in this connection, also the practice of nobles to put pressure on courts by a show of force (on both of these, see above). The constriction of the legal and practical room for manoeuvre of noble rule also had visible consequences. In the south of England at least, the lords increasingly abandoned the fortification of their dwellings.156 Following the far-reaching integration of the rule of the high nobility into the practice of generalised monarchical rule, two particular 'gaps' in this still remained. Manorial courts endured as an institution for the enforcement of private authority. Even if this rule was restricted by law, and - what was more important - by the resistance of the tenants, it still remained outside of the generalised rule. A further gap in generalised power was the so-called 'benefit of clergy'. 翻译到这里 This privilege had been introduced in the twelfth century. It guaranteed that the majority of offences committed by clerics - exceptions were laid down - would be tried by church courts. Over the centuries, this clerical privilege was gradually extended to the better-off laity. Because literacy had at one time been largely confined to members of religious orders, a legal construction developed by which proof of literacy was equated with membership of a religious order. This clerical privilege was not open to appeal. In the sixteenth century, however, it was granted to many first offenders, who in practice were as good as acquitted. No one could plead benefit of clergy a second time. Courts oper-ated with the legal fiction that a first condemnation brought with it exclusion from the religious order, so that the person concerned no longer belonged to an order if they appeared before the court again. In the seventeenth century, the list of those offences for which clerical privilege could not be adduced in any case was widened. Benefit of clergy was finally abolished - and thus an estate-type gap in generalised royal judicial power filled - in 1827.157 A particular structural feature of the ancien régime in England was that the institution that developed into the most important instrument of monarchical power in the course of the sixteenth century represented at the same time a potential gap in this power. It was certainly a prerogative of the crown to appoint peace commissioners, remove Justices of the Peace and control the practice of these in office. Politically, however, the possibilities of exercising these powers were very limited, if a proposed or a sitting Justice was supported by locally influential families. We shall discuss later on the regularisation of the practice of appointing ‘keepers of the peace' and later Justices of the Peace. What had originally been established as local instances of public order with limited tasks, developed under the Tudors into an institution that was to form the centre of local administrative and judicial power for a full three hundred years. Thomas Garden Barnes is of the view that this expansion of tasks and authority was so decisive that it can even be said that Justices of the Peace as well as lords lieutenant were an invention of the Tudor era.158 The crown's intention was to make the Justices of the Peace an executive organ of royal policy. The king's advisers, assembled regularly in Council, took care that legal provisions regarding the regulation of labour conditions, the disciplining of and aid to the poor and the punishment of vagabonds, were all made generally known. Increasing attention was paid to the instruction of travelling judicial commissions, with frequent instructions to the Justices of the Peace in the counties to check up on the local constables. Repeatedly from 1576, in the ‘books of orders', and especially in 1630-1, administrative instructions were given for dealing with inflation and plague. Since the crown needed to win support in the counties from men who had independent influence there, the implementation of its policy remained dependent on the king's aims being shared by locally dominant families. If this was not the case, then ‘negligence' arose, if not a regular opposing policy or in the worst case - as in the years after 1634 - refusal to serve as Justice of the Peace. On the whole, the effectiveness of local government practice improved the possibilities of implementing estate interests. If these coincided with the intentions of the crown, then Justices of the Peace were instruments of royal policy. If they ran against the goals of royal policy, then the power of the Justices of the Peace became an obstacle to the king's government.”翻译为中文","output":"教区级别的职权特性，从某种程度上说变得更加有限，因为排斥的做法越来越针对整个贫困人口，而不再针对富裕的农民和大农场主。（这一发展从十七世纪下半叶开始加剧，尽管存在一定的地区差异。）取代了对地方普遍权力实践的专属阶层参与，教区级别出现了一种由财产和阶级利益主导的参与结构。然而，在郡一级，选择的阶层标准继续不减。通过这种方式，乡绅确保了他们占有实践和定义良好秩序结构的有利条件。 “良好秩序” 只有当世界的变化破坏了那些将改革者谴责为异端、反抗上帝意愿者的秩序观念时，良好秩序的内容变化才不可避免地成为争论的焦点。在当代对上帝和世界的观念、美好生活和“良好统治”的理念中，与维护旧秩序观念和引入新秩序观念的冲突相关的唯一方面才是此处相关的。在这方面——就像所有深刻变革时期一样——维护竞争秩序观念的群体并不与一方的“权威”和另一方的被统治者（或下层阶级）相同。即使在实际参与或有潜力参与统治实践的人中，也存在对何为良好秩序以及最佳维护或建立该秩序的方法的不同观念。 在讨论这些差异之前，首先要注意的是，在十六世纪和十七世纪早期，很多人接受了一些定义良好秩序的观念，认为这是不容置疑的。我们可以从传统行为模式和抗议背景中的表述中得出结论，这种普遍观点甚至常常为那些根据托马斯·史密斯的说法“只有在他们被统治的范围内才被纳入公共财富”的人所共享——换句话说，日工、贫穷的农民、小商人、手工艺者、女性和儿童。我们有充分的理由认为，这些人的绝大多数持有的观点是，每个人都应该尊敬上帝并服从国王或女王，同样，仆人和学徒要服从他们的主人，孩子服从他们的父母，女人服从他们的男性。在女性继承王国、公国或伯国的情况下，普遍观点做出了例外，因为在这种情况下，决定性的因素不是年龄或性别，而是将她们带入世界的“血统”。 良好秩序被构想为一种等级制度，只有每个人都有一个主人，其维护才被视为可能。在旧制度下将某人描述为“无主人”的，就是将他们归咎于各种不守纪律的行为。对一个主人的顺从戒律包括了每个人，甚至是最有权力的贵族。 随着人口增长和经济与社会形态的变化，使得土地财产的盈利性开发（虽然不是普遍的，但在许多地区是决定性的），“无主人状态”成为那些负责建立秩序及其手段的当局的一个持续问题。关于解决这一问题所需方法的观点存在分歧。而我们已经处于“良好秩序”的内容和策略的不同观念中了。 大卫·昂德伍德将公共秩序政策的主要倾向总结如下：一方面，是对传统和习俗的、合作形式的以及对“和谐”垂直社会观念的倾向，另一方面，是试图实现道德改革、促进个人主义和个人责任的尝试。就公共秩序策略而言，前一倾向旨在通过维护一种确切的、在习俗中根深蒂固的结构来实现社会稳定。因此，公共秩序政策应该尽可能地防止变化。另一战略立场则面向处理变化的社会后果。这里的稳定被理解为一种更“形式化”的意义，即作为确保统治，但不是特定文化和社会形式。 将不同的秩序观念归因于代表性的社会群体或统治机构的简单模式是不成功的。因为存在文化冲突，其中表达了阶层差异和阶级对立，以及统治阶层中更倾向清教徒和更倾向传统的成员之间的冲突。这些确实部分与“朝廷”和“乡村”之间的冲突（将在下文解释）重合，但也被关于中央权力实际范围的斗争所掩盖。最后，还存在重要的地区差异。因为根据生产和定居形式的不同，下层阶级对旧秩序观念的坚持程度不一，而他们的沟通结构赋予了他们更大或较小的能力来捍卫这些观念。 只有当统治的普遍化达到一定程度，以至于普遍化的统治不再仅限于财政占有和内战的预防时，讨论公共秩序政策的观念和策略差异才在分析上有意义。至少从十六世纪下半叶开始，英格兰就是这种情况。 与推进宗教改革的政治策略和改善武装力量的组织相关的策略，使得君主统治变得更加广泛和深入。并不是当时的领土领主被剥夺财产（1536年在埃利、达勒姆和海克瑟姆的主教治下的之前自治行政的废除，在总体发展趋势中相当不典型），而是一些以前统治实践中的“空白”被填补了。 其中一个“空白”是空间上的。直到宗教改革，世俗法律的有效性在宗教“庇护所”处停止。任何身份的男人或女人都可以通过逃亡到庇护所来逃避当局的追捕。庇护所的废除意味着政治上对此前被视为严重罪恶的做法的认可。（就像许多情况一样，在庇护所废除方面，需要区分法律形势的革命性变化和在一定程度上一直保留至今的行为模式。） 一个更为重要的普遍统治中的“空白”在十六世纪及十七世纪前几十年的过程中日益被废除。随着贵族的随从变得越来越稀少和缩小，私人武装力量的组织逐渐结束，与此相关，贵族通过武力展示向法庭施压的做法也随之结束。 贵族统治的法律和实践操作空间的收缩也有了明显的后果。至少在英格兰南部，领主们日益放弃加固他们的住所。 随着高级贵族的统治实践被广泛整合进君主普遍统治实践之后，这种普遍权力中仍然存在两个特殊的“空白”。领地法庭作为实施私人权威的机构继续存在。即使这种统治受到法律的限制，并且更重要的是受到租户的抵抗，但它仍然位于普遍统治之外。普遍权力的另一个“空白”是所谓的“教士豁免权”。 这种特权在十二世纪引入。它保证了大多数由教士犯下的罪行——除了规定的例外——将由教会法庭审理。几个世纪以来，这种教士特权逐渐扩展到较富裕的俗人中。因为曾经的读写能力大多限于宗教团体成员，因此发展出一种法律构造，将读写能力视同为宗教团体成员。教士豁免权不可上诉。然而，在十六世纪，它被授予许多初犯者，实际上等同于无罪释放。任何人都不能第二次请求教士豁免权。法庭运作的法律虚构是首次定罪带来了被排除出宗教团体，因此如果再次出现在法庭前，该人不再属于任何团体。在十七世纪，无法以任何情况下提出教士豁免权的罪行名单被扩大。教士豁免权最终在1827年被废除——从而填补了普遍皇家司法权力中的一个阶层性“空白”。 英格兰旧制度的一个特殊结构特征是，在十六世纪形成的、成为君主权力最重要工具的机构同时代表了这种权力中的潜在“空白”。的确，任命警察和撤销治安法官以及控制他们的职务实践是皇冠的特权。然而，政治上，如果被提名的或现任的治安法官得到了当地有影响力的家族的支持，行使这些权力的可能性非常有限。 稍后我们将讨论“维持和平者”任命实践的规范化及其后来的治安法官。最初作为具有限定任务的地方公共秩序实体而建立的，发展为都铎王朝下形成地方行政和司法权力中心三百年的机构。托马斯·加登·巴恩斯认为，任务和权威的扩大如此决定性，甚至可以说治安法官和郡中尉是都铎时代的发明。 皇冠的意图是使治安法官成为皇家政策的执行机构。国王的顾问们定期在议会中聚集，确保有关劳动条件的法律规定、对穷人的纪律和援助以及对流浪汉的惩罚都被普遍知晓。越来越多地注意指导巡回审判委员会，频繁指示郡的治安法官检查当地警长。从1576年开始，特别是在1630-31年的“命令书”中，反复就应对通货膨胀和瘟疫发布了行政指示。由于皇冠需要赢得郡中有独立影响力的人的支持，其政策的实施仍然依赖于国王的目标被当地占主导地位的家族所共享。如果不是这种情况，那么就会出现“疏忽”，如果不是正式的反对政策，那么在最糟糕的情况下 - 就像在1634年之后的几年里 - 拒绝担任治安法官。总的来说，地方政府实践的效力提高了实现阶层利益的可能性。如果这些与皇冠的意图一致，那么治安法官就是皇家政策的工具。如果它们与皇家政策的目标相悖，那么治安法官的权力就成了国王政府的障碍。"},{"instruction":"请将“The effective execution of generalised monarchical power in the counties required that ‘good order' be established by the application of laws and royal decrees. Yet obedience to the law, as many contemporaries affirmed, was not one of the outstanding qualities of the English population. Strategies aiming to enforce such obedience were seen by the groups involved, as they later were by historians, as an indispensable precondition for the establishment of orderly conditions. Only quite recently have scholars pointed out that, under the ancien régime too, there were procedures of maintaining orderly conditions that stood outside and in partial contradiction to the letter of the law, but served their purpose none the less. Strategies that aimed to make these procedures impossible, and instead tied the notion of public order precisely to royal law, amounted to a fundamental cultural transformation - in the truest sense of the term. This was the result of prolonged struggles, in the course of which one side had the advantage that it possessed the means of generalised power. The public-order practice that was eventually established was directed either to maintaining peaceful coexistence in the context of the locally estab-lished forms of rule of the time, or to re-impose such peace if it had been dis-turbed. In this perspective, the strict execution of a legal provision (especially if this ran against long-practised modes of behaviour) could be seen precisely as a reason for discontent, as could the intervention of judicial process in a matter that could well have been dealt with outside the courts. It could sometimes promote coexistence in a community much more effectively if a victim of theft was satisfied with the return of the item stolen, than if he took his neighbour to court and brought misfortune to a whole family. (The notion of ‘neighbour' under the ancien régime embraced the entire immediate social milieu, rather then the stricter geographical meaning it has today.) Even local constables often had recourse to traditional measures, whether because they shared the views of their neighbours or simply because they wanted to be tolerated by them. This meant that they too did not judge all thefts alike, but might react either with a warning or with an attempt to reach an appropriate settlement outside of court.159 And whereas brewing ale for the purpose of drinking bouts was certainly treated as an offence, they could only very reluctantly be led to report a villager who occasionally brewed his own liquor.160 If, however, things did come to a regular court case - often on the basis of private informants161 -, jurors were supposed to 'present' the case to the Justices whenever life or limb was at stake, Since such 'presentment juries' were responsibly for establishing the facts of the case, they had a decisive influence on the verdict. If the accused was a local person, then - in a formulation of J.H. Baker - his neighbours in their capacity as jurors formed a shield between him and the law.162 The criteria employed by these 'neighbours' were not neces-sarily more tolerant or just, but they were often different from those that the crown demanded.163 By strategies of both the crown and the Justices, the application of tradi-tional practices of public order was pressed back in the course of the sixteenth century: the authority of Justices in summary proceedings was expanded, so that formal court processes became more rare. This reduced the influence of jurors on judicial practice. When the collaboration of 'presentment juries' was prescribed, the exercise of traditional conceptions of public order could also be limited by judicial commissions demanding 'presentments' that were drafted with respect to legal provisions.164 Besides, until 1670, penalties could also be imposed on jurors who did not deliver their verdict according to the letter of the law.165 Justices of the Peace now took increasing care that local constables also acquired a certain knowledge of the law, even if they could not actually read. If they neglected this duty, they could count on being punished. Whilst the expansion of the authority of Justices of the Peace affected the entire kingdom, there were wide regional, local and even individual differ-ences in the degree to which their practice ran counter to traditional public-order practices or the neglect of these. There were more than a few magistrates, moreover, who stuck to a more traditional notion of order. In this case, the exclusion of 'presentment juries' from the majority of cases, though it ruled out the influence of immediate neighbours, did not necessarily mean that the traditional idea of ‘good order' had been abandoned. Correspondingly, Justices of the Peace only found it urgently necessary to set aside the independence of local constables and transform these into an instrument of authority, when they themselves sought to carry through a new public-order policy. Most Justices of the Peace were concerned to carry out their office in such a way as not to damage the crown's goodwill. The change in the practice of pub-lic order was introduced - with some exceptions - above all by Justices who upheld puritanical (in the broadest sense) notions of ‘good order'. These used the opportunities with which the crown had provided them by the expansion of their authority, and which they had acquired by the disciplining of auxiliary forces, in order to achieve the moral reform of society. Their pressing goal was not the maintenance of a practice of rule that had proved itself by not provoking discontent, but rather the realisation of specific principles. Many of these judicial ‘entrepreneurs of morality' (K. Wrightson) vigorously campaigned against traditional festivals and Sunday entertainments in the early decades of the seventeenth century. They sought to eradicate drunk-enness, whoring and laziness root and branch, and took pains to ensure that Sunday was kept sacred and family ties respected. Many of these moral rig- orists were prepared if need be to confront not only the lower orders, but also their equals and the king's advisers. Conflict with the crown arose in particular over the attitude towards Sun-day entertainments. Whilst many Justices would allow no sport apart from archery (useful for military purposes), and even this only after the end of a very long Sunday service, the crown passed laws in 1617, 1618 and especially 1633 that permitted a whole range of Sunday entertainments. Those Justices who sought to intervene on Sundays to prevent sin were told by their opponents that football was ‘in the book'. Embittered Justices saw the ‘book of sports' as evidence of the corrupt morality of the court. David Underdown points out that these laws represented, for the first time in England, a manipulative attitude to the stabilising contents of traditional popular culture.166 Forms of public communication such as those offered by market and feast days, and by sporting competitions, had always contained the possibility of erupting into rebellious behaviour, but at the same time they signified fixed points in the annual course of a public life that was integrated into the practice of traditional rule. Only when the moral reformers forced members of the lower orders to defend the manner and form in which they sought recreation, did dancing, card playing and enthusiasm for a good game of football come to be seen as acts of resistance against authority. Whether such resistance was actually practised, to what extent and with what success, depended not least - as Underdown has shown - on the regionally dominant forms of agricultural production and the patterns of settlement and communication that corre-sponded to these.167 Defence of custom as the guiding thread of public-order practice remained, on the whole, confined to particular spheres. If Justices went so far as to whip not only young 'vagabonds' and put them in the pillory, but old 'vagabonds' as well,168 this was a departure from custom. The same went for the constables if they reported 'vagabonds' or even arrested them themselves. J.S. Sharpe reports how in 1621 villagers attempted to prevent the imprisonment of a 'vagabond'. There must have been many instances of this kind, whether documented or not, but they were not typical. The case rather seems to have been that in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries wandering beggars lost whatever protection they had traditionally enjoyed - limited though this may have been - on the basis of the commandment of Christian charity and noble hospitality. On the whole, the criminal practices that made up the actual core of Eliza-bethan Poor Law met with little resistance.169 For example, in a district of Lan-cashire that has been studied in detail, it was reported that the local constables increasingly reported 'vagabonds' in the 1630, though offences by local per-sons continued to be reported only rarely.170 The harshness of the law was thus applied selectively according to social criteria, and in this the forces of order enjoyed - on the whole - the support of the population. (At the general level of our discussion here, the differences between village and towns - with the exception of London - were no greater than those between different rural districts.) This attitude can be explained principally because the number of itinerant poor had grown since the second half of the sixteenth century, while after the wars of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, many dis-charged soldiers (and in 1627-8 many deserters) wandered the countryside and resorted to begging until they could find new work. At least equally deci-sive, however, were the changed preconditions for the social perception of poverty, since public-order practices were determined not by the objective situation, but by the shape and form in which this situation was regarded and defined as a 'problem' in (power-structured) public discourse (according to P. Slack).171 It was in this connection that the differences between the material conditions of life of members of the non-privileged orders, which had grown since the second half of the sixteenth century, acquired their significance for public-order policy. With the formation of a group of materially better-off families who regarded themselves as righteous, and the simultaneously deteriorating situation of members of the lowest social strata, tendencies to socially exclude the poor were increasingly marked. Initially the poor from other districts were discrim-inated against, then also the local poor. In these processes of social differen-tiation (if not outright polarisation), Poor Law repression obtained a support that went far beyond the ruling orders. As a result of these social changes, the preconditions for traditional ways of securing peace in the neighbourhood also disappeared - at different rates according to the particular region.”翻译为中文","output":"在郡一级，有效执行普遍化的君主权力要求通过应用法律和国王法令建立“良好秩序”。然而，正如许多同时代人所确认的，对法律的服从并不是英格兰人民的突出品质之一。旨在强制执行此类服从的策略被涉及群体视为建立有序条件不可或缺的前提条件，后来历史学家也持同样看法。只是最近学者们才指出，在旧制度下，也存在维护有序条件的程序，这些程序在一定程度上与法律的字面含义相矛盾，但仍然达到了其目的。旨在使这些程序不可能的策略，而是将公共秩序的概念准确地与皇家法律联系起来，相当于一次根本性的文化转变——在最真实的意义上。这是长期斗争的结果，其中一方因拥有普遍权力的手段而占据优势。 最终建立的公共秩序实践旨在维护当时地方建立的统治形式下的和平共处，或在和平受到干扰时重新强加和平。从这个角度来看，严格执行法律规定（特别是如果这与长期实践的行为模式相悖）可能正是不满的原因，司法程序干预本可以在法庭外解决的事务也是如此。如果盗窃受害者对偷窃物品的归还感到满意，有时可能比将邻居告上法庭并给整个家庭带来不幸更能有效促进社区内的共处。（在旧制度下，“邻居”的概念包括整个直接的社会环境，而不是它今天更严格的地理含义。） 即使当地警官也经常采取传统措施，无论是因为他们与邻居持相同观点，还是仅仅因为他们希望被邻居容忍。这意味着他们也不会将所有盗窃行为一概而论，而可能会做出警告，或尝试在法庭外达成适当和解。而且，尽管为聚会酿造麦芽酒肯定被视为一种违法行为，但他们很不情愿报告偶尔酿造自酿酒的村民。 但是，如果事情确实发展到了正式的法庭案件——经常基于私人线人——陪审员应该在生命或肢体受到威胁时将案件\\"陈述\\"给法官。由于这些“陈述陪审团”负责查明案件事实，他们对判决有决定性影响。如果被告是当地人，那么就如J.H.贝克尔的说法，他的邻居作为陪审员在他和法律之间形成了一道屏障。这些“邻居”采用的标准不一定更宽容或公正，但往往与皇室要求的不同。 皇室和法官的策略使传统的公共秩序实践在十六世纪的过程中受到了压制：治安法官在简易程序中的权威得到了扩大，从而使正式的法庭程序变得更加罕见。这减少了陪审员对司法实践的影响。当要求“陈述陪审团”的协作时，也可以通过司法委员会要求的根据法律规定起草的“陈述”来限制传统的公共秩序观念的行使。此外，直到1670年，如果陪审员没有根据法律的字面意义作出裁决，还可以对他们处以处罚。治安法官现在越来越注意确保地方警官也获得了一定的法律知识，即使他们实际上可能不识字。如果他们忽视这一职责，他们可以指望被惩罚。 虽然治安法官的权威扩展影响了整个王国，但在他们的实践与传统公共秩序实践或忽视这些实践的程度上存在广泛的地区、地方甚至个体差异。此外，还有不少法官坚持较传统的秩序观念。在这种情况下，将“陈述陪审团”排除在大多数案件之外，虽然排除了直接邻居的影响，但并不一定意味着传统的“良好秩序”观念已被抛弃。 相应地，只有当治安法官自己寻求实施新的公共秩序政策时，才迫切需要搁置地方警官的独立性并将其转变为权威工具。 大多数治安法官都希望以不损害皇室好感的方式执行他们的职责。公共秩序实践的变化——一些例外除外——主要是由那些坚持清教徒（广义上）“良好秩序”观念的法官引入的。这些人利用了皇冠通过扩大他们的权威提供的机会，以及他们通过对辅助力量进行纪律化所获得的机会，以实现社会的道德改革。他们的迫切目标不是维持一种通过不引起不满而证明自身的统治实践，而是实现特定原则。 许多这些司法“道德企业家”（K. 莱特森）在十七世纪早期积极反对传统节日和星期天娱乐活动。他们寻求根除酗酒、嫖娼和懒惰，努力确保星期天被视为神圣并且家庭关系受到尊重。许多这些道德严苛者准备在必要时不仅对抗下层阶级，而且对抗他们的同辈甚至国王的顾问。 与皇室的冲突特别是围绕对星期天娱乐活动的态度展开的。尽管许多法官只允许射箭（出于军事目的），甚至这也只能在非常长的星期天服务结束后进行，皇室在1617年、1618年和特别是1633年通过了允许一系列星期天娱乐活动的法律。那些试图在星期天干预以阻止罪行的法官被对手告知踢足球是“书中所说”。愤怒的法官将“体育活动书”视为法庭道德腐化的证据。大卫·昂德伍德指出，这些法律首次代表了英格兰对传统民间文化稳定内容的操纵态度。 市场和节日，以及体育竞赛等公共交流形式一直包含爆发为反抗行为的可能性，但同时也标志着传统统治实践中公共生活年度进程的固定点。只有当道德改革者强迫下层阶级为捍卫他们寻求娱乐的方式和形式而进行抗争时，跳舞、打牌和对一场好足球赛的热情才被视为对权威的抵抗行为。这种抵抗是否真正实践，以及在多大程度上和以何种成功取决于——正如昂德伍德所示——农业生产的区域主导形式以及与之相对应的定居和沟通模式。 整体而言，对习俗作为公共秩序实践的指导原则的捍卫主要局限于特定领域。如果法官不仅鞭打年轻的“流浪汉”并将他们置于颜面架上，而且对老“流浪汉”也这样做，那么这就偏离了习俗。同样，如果警官举报“流浪汉”甚至亲自逮捕他们。J.S.夏普报告说，在1621年，村民试图阻止一名“流浪汉”的监禁。这种情况一定有很多，无论是否有记录，但它们并不典型。相反，似乎在十六和十七世纪的过程中，流浪的乞丐失去了他们传统上所享有的保护——尽管这可能是有限的——基于基督教慈善和贵族好客的命令。 总的来说，伊丽莎白时代《贫困法》的实际核心构成的刑事实践遇到的抵抗很少。例如，在详细研究的兰开夏郡的一个地区，据报道，当地警官在1630年代日益举报“流浪汉”，尽管对当地人的违法行为继续很少报道。因此，法律的严厉性根据社会标准有选择性地应用，而在这方面，秩序力量在整体上得到了人们的支持。（在我们这里的讨论中，除伦敦外，村庄和城镇之间的差异并不大于不同农村地区之间的差异。）这种态度主要可以解释为，自十六世纪下半叶以来，流浪贫困者的数量增加，而在十六世纪末和十七世纪初的战争之后，许多退伍士兵（在1627-8年许多逃兵）在农村流浪并求助乞讨，直到他们能找到新工作。然而，至少同样决定性的是，贫困的社会感知前提条件的改变，因为公共秩序实践不是由客观情况决定的，而是由这种情况被如何看待和定义为“问题”的（权力结构化的）公共话语的形状和形式决定的（根据P. 斯莱克）。在这方面，自十六世纪下半叶以来非特权阶层成员的生活物质条件之间的差异增大，这对公共秩序政策具有重要意义。 随着认为自己为正直的、物质条件较好的家庭群体的形成，以及最低社会阶层成员状况的恶化，越来越多地倾向于社会排斥贫困者。最初是来自其他地区的穷人受到歧视，然后也包括本地穷人。在这些社会分化过程中（如果不是彻底的两极分化），《贫困法》的压迫获得了远远超出统治阶层的支持。由于这些社会变化，传统维护邻里和平的方式的前提条件也消失了——根据不同地区的不同速度。"},{"instruction":"请将“What appeared in their place - increasingly after the sixteenth century - was a public-order strategy that continued through to the nineteenth century to serve the ancien régime in England as a typical way of dealing with social unrest. Its application was provoked by the fact that even those inhabitants of villages and towns who did not seek to be seen as respectable and were constantly in need, had only two possibilities of making their claims known: petition or rebellious behaviour. The limits were fluid, as 'trouble-makers' generally also petitioned, and the authorities often defined even the process of petitioning as rebellion. If the demands made by way of petition and 'dis-turbance' were recognised at the local level as justified or at least understand-able, many Justices applied a procedure that was not envisaged in the laws of the kingdom or the decrees of the Privy Council, using the power of their office to settle social conflicts politically. They were all the more ready to do so if the protestors stuck to forms that affirmed their basic faithfulness to the law. That 'trouble-makers' were very largely aware of these preconditions is shown by the formulations of their petitions, not least by the fact that in cases of inflammatory price rises bread was not simply appropriated, but sold at the price that was deemed as just and the proceeds paid out to the bakers. This perspective also explains the attempt by protestors that J. Walter reports, for legal advice in respect of their demands and behaviour.172 Local conditions, and the specific conduct of rebels and magistrates, varied, as did the occasions that provoked rebellion. The numerous studies of particular 'disturbances' that we now have to hand, however, demonstrate a fairly clear pattern of a regular procedure for settling conflicts that was set under way by both sides. It was not rare for Justices to use the occasion of 'disturbances' to protest against particular measures of the crown - such as the granting of export licenses in times of inflation.173 Most of them were only prepared to enforce the drastic measures that the Privy Council prescribed for all cases of social unrest, if they feared for the property of the wealthy or even their own life and limb. If this was the case, then draconian punishment was applied - just as in other societies of the 'ancien-régime' structure. A differentiated response to demands of the (lower) people, however, must have been sufficiently common for the 'rebels' to submit time and again to the unwritten laws of this practice. If the Justices of the Peace, either by themselves or (as was later the general rule) together with other members of the responsible Commission of the Peace, negotiated with rebels and on occasion sought to abolish particular conditions that had inflamed them, they were guided in the first place by local requirements for the maintenance or restoration of orderly conditions, and not - as the Privy Council demanded - by general legal provisions. This practical criticism of a universal validity of the equation of 'order' and 'law' continued the old practice of achieving local peace by 'neighbourly' compul-sion. But the continuity ended here. For the 'settlement' of the Justices was an exercise of rule: the precondition for it was that the criteria for the legitimating of modes of behaviour by 'neighbours' had disappeared in the course of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Besides, the Justices possessed not just the means of social discrimination, but also those of specific and draco-nian punishment. The institutionalisation of estate-based local government practice revolutionised the social character of public-order practice outside the courts. b.3. 'The charms of the sovereign' In Section b.1 we announced the project of tracing the particular structural characteristics of the ancien régime in England by an analytical distinction between centralised and generalised power - in other words, between the policy of the crown and the practice of royal government by members of the ruling estates. The potential difference between the political goals that were pursued in each of these two spheres of royal policy formed a structural pre-condition for crises in the system of rule. Before this thesis is developed in more detail, it is necessary to warn against possible misunderstandings. The distinction between centralised and generalised power remains purely analytical, in so far as all means of generalised power belonged to the reigning monarch in person. The application of judicial power on the basis of general laws and principles of common law, the command of armed men in war and the collection of taxes (down to contributions for the poor that were raised at parish level), took place in the name of the king or queen. This generalised power, however, was practised by men (in rare cases, such as the administra-tion of wardships or forest rights, possibly also by women), who served the king or queen in this way. This personal character of rule is not easy for social scientists of today to comprehend. They are inclined therefore to see the ser-vants of reigning monarchs as executive organs of an early modern state, and to equate this generalised power with the 'public power' that is customary in modern times. Ernst Kantorowicz, for example, concluded from the contem-porary doctrine of the 'two bodies of the king' that royal rule in England under the ancien régime was distinct from the person of the king and conceived as a power of public office. As evidence of this conception, Kantorowicz adduced the quasi-legal argument that was made by Parliament when it took up arms against Charles I in 1642.174 Frederic William Maitland, on the other hand, saw this rhetoric of revolution as no evidence for structural developments having already taken place, no more did George E. Aylmer later on. Aylmer held to the fundamental structural difference between service to the king and a state bureaucracy, and argued that until 1649 there were no indications of the latter as yet in England.175 Maitland emphasised that the king's rule in England was not developed until the seventeenth century as a power of office distinct from the person of the king, rather the arbitrary power of the king that was in principle unlimited had to be removed step by step in the form of legal regu- lation.176 If kings kept to such limitations in their practice of government, they did not thereby become organs of a public power. The government remained the property of a royal person, but disposal over this property was limited by custom, by formalised ‘arrangements' and specific conditions of rule. In the process of formation of the ancien régime, i.e. the generalisation of estate interests, it was especially the king's disposal of feudal tenures that was to a large extent withdrawn (by fiscalisation). Kings thus lost those founda-tions of their power that for the sake of simplicity we sum up as ‘feudal'. But this was far from amounting to the decisive weakening of personal rule, and thus the beginning of modern statehood, that has frequently been supposed. For out of the (above described) generalisation of estate interests into an instance that sanctioned private power of appropriation and whose authority also extended to the political mastery of social crises, personal monarchical rule obtained a new social basis.177 This development became possible and was strengthened by the ‘end of rebellions' of the high nobility, which Law-rence Stone has treated in detail.178 Since the nobles lost to a large extent their private possession of armed force, they became court nobles. (A term that refers here to the conditions of reproduction of their political power.) The structural change in the basis of royal rule was expressed in the formula of the ‘King in Parliament'. This did not mean that Parliament had appropri-ated the previous royal possession of rule. Even after the Reformation this was not the case - as noted above. When Henry VIII set out to free the English kingdom from the sphere of papal rule, he used Parliament as an 'instrument' of his policy.179 This policy cost him lands, titles, and tenancy concessions, but it did not lead to kings and queens having to make future decisions of religious policy even in agreement with Parliament. When, in 1604, James I decisively rejected the demands of the Puritans for the disempowerment of bishops, at the theological conference he had called at Hampton Court, this occurred in the context of the Privy Council and not in Parliament.180 This did not lessen in any way the effect of his decision, nor did it lead to any kind of crisis for the church or the monarch's own power. The 'King in Parliament' continued to be the king in his Parliament, i.e. an assembly that was called and dismissed at the request of the monarch, and whose participants, though they might well permit themselves forceful criticism of the present course of government, would attend Parliament again after a spell of imprisonment in the Tower of London. For this reason, it is also proper to speak of 'parliaments' in the plural rather than in the singular. The establishment of Parliament as such, an institution independent of the will of the monarch, was a revolutionary act. This institutionalisation of Parliament was only decisively accomplished at the turn of the eighteenth century (cf. below). Parliaments could be used for the settlement of disputes (in the form of 'private bills'). They served to inform the king or queen - in pressing terms, if necessary - as to the conditions of their rule. Only in relation to the granting of taxes, however, was it established under the ancien régime that reigning monarchs, if they wanted to effectively collect the taxes they had demanded, had to seek the approval of Parliament. The possibility of refusing such taxes, however, as we have already shown, was quite limited, and the extra-parlia-mentary practice of royal fiscal power in no way completely eliminated. In the phase of the ancien régime under discussion here, the centre of policy did not lie in Parliament, not even in the connection of Parliament and the Privy Council. The centre of policy was rather the court. It was at court that factions were formed - on the basis of competition for patronage, personal intrigue, kinship connections and serious political convictions - and sought to influence the king or queen. Sometimes these factions lasted only a short while, occasionally they persisted for years. When Parliaments were called - as a temporary expansion of the Privy Council - these court factions sought to win broader influence there. In this connection, the influence that great nobles exercised on members of the Commons by the use of their patronage was of particular significance for the government of England. The view upheld by many authors that the Commons was politically com-pletely in the hands of influential lords, overlooks the fact that members of the gentry, if they profited from patronage, did not necessarily have to see themselves as 'bought'. The lords, too, were required for their part to take into account local expectations, if they wanted to be powerful in one or more counties, and on this basis have influence at court.”翻译为中文","output":"在十六世纪之后，取代之前的做法的是一种公共秩序策略，这种策略一直延续到十九世纪，成为英格兰旧制度处理社会动荡的典型方式。其应用是由于即使是那些不寻求被视为体面人士并且经常处于困境的村庄和城镇居民，也只有两种方式来表达他们的诉求：请愿或叛乱行为。界限是模糊的，因为被认为是“制造麻烦的人”通常也会请愿，当局经常把请愿过程本身定义为叛乱。如果地方层面承认通过请愿和“骚乱”提出的要求是正当的或至少是可以理解的，许多法官会应用一种不在王国法律或枢密院法令中预见的程序，利用他们的职权政治解决社会冲突。如果抗议者坚持表达他们对法律的基本忠诚的形式，法官们会更愿意这样做。 “制造麻烦的人”非常清楚这些前提条件，这一点从他们请愿书的措辞中可以看出，尤其是在价格上涨引发不满的情况下，面包不是简单地被占有，而是以被认为公正的价格出售，收入支付给面包师。这一视角也解释了抗议者寻求关于他们的要求和行为的法律建议的尝试。 地方条件、叛乱者和法官的具体行为以及引发叛乱的原因各不相同。然而，我们现在拥有的关于特定“骚乱”的众多研究展示了双方开启解决冲突的常规程序的相当清晰的模式。 法官使用“骚乱”的场合抗议皇室的特定措施（如在通货膨胀时期授予出口许可）并不少见。大多数法官只有在担心富人的财产甚至是他们自己的生命和财产安全时，才会执行枢密院为所有社会动荡情况规定的严厉措施。如果是这种情况，就会施加严厉的惩罚——就像在其他“旧制度”结构的社会中一样。然而，对（下层）民众的要求做出差异化反应在相当普遍程度上必须是常见的，因为“叛乱者”一次又一次地提交到这种实践的不成文法则之下。 如果治安法官，不论是独自一人还是（后来成为普遍规则）与其他负责的治安委员会成员一起，与叛乱者进行谈判，并在某些情况下寻求消除激发他们不满的特定情况，他们首先是被当地维护或恢复有序条件的需求所指导，而不是——如枢密院要求的那样——由一般法律规定所指导。对‘秩序’与‘法律’等同的普遍有效性的这种实践性批评，延续了通过‘邻里’压力实现地方和平的旧实践。但连续性到此为止。因为法官的“和解”是一种统治行为：其前提条件是‘邻里’通过合法化行为方式的标准在十六世纪和十七世纪初期的过程中已经消失。此外，法官不仅拥有社会歧视的手段，还拥有特定和严厉的惩罚手段。基于阶层的地方政府实践的制度化，革命性地改变了法庭外公共秩序实践的社会特性。 在第b.1节中，我们宣布了追溯英格兰旧制度的特定结构特征的计划，通过区分中央集权和普遍权力——换句话说，区分皇室政策和统治阶层成员的皇家政府实践。这两个领域的皇家政策所追求的政治目标之间潜在的差异形成了统治体系危机的结构性前提条件。在更详细地发展这一论点之前，有必要警告可能的误解。 中央集权与普遍权力之间的区分纯粹是分析性的，因为所有普遍权力的手段都属于在位君主个人。基于一般法律和普通法原则的司法权力的应用、在战争中指挥武装人员和征税（直至在教区级别征收的穷人捐款），都是以国王或女王的名义进行的。然而，这种普遍权力是由为国王或女王服务的男性（在少数情况下，如监护权或森林权的管理，可能也由女性）实践的。当代社会科学家很难理解这种统治的个人特性。因此，他们倾向于将在位君主的仆人视为早期现代国家的执行机关，并将这种普遍权力等同于现代习惯中的“公共权力”。例如，恩斯特·康托罗维茨从“国王的两体说”的当代理论得出结论，英格兰在旧制度下的王权不同于国王的个人，被视为公职权力。作为这一观念的证据，康托罗维茨援引了1642年议会对抗查理一世时提出的准法律论点。另一方面，弗雷德里克·威廉·梅特兰认为，这种革命的修辞并不是结构发展已经发生的证据，乔治·E·艾尔默后来也持有相同观点。艾尔默坚持认为为国王服务与国家官僚制之间有根本的结构区别，并认为直到1649年，在英格兰还没有迹象表明后者已经出现。梅特兰强调，国王在英格兰的统治直到十七世纪才作为一种与国王个人不同的公职权力发展起来，而国王原则上不受限制的专制权力必须通过法律逐步去除。如果国王在其统治实践中遵守这些限制，他们并没有因此成为公共权力的机关。政府仍然是一个王室个人的财产，但对这一财产的支配受到习俗、正式化的“安排”和特定统治条件的限制。 在旧制度的形成过程中，即阶层利益的普遍化过程中，国王对封建领地的支配在很大程度上被剥夺（通过财政化）。因此，国王失去了为简单起见我们总结为“封建”的那些权力基础。但这远未达到通常所假设的对个人统治的决定性削弱，从而开启现代国家的开始。因为从（上述描述的）阶层利益的普遍化成为一个制裁私人占有权力的实例和其权威也扩展到政治掌控社会危机的过程中，个人君主统治获得了新的社会基础。这种发展在高级贵族“叛乱”的终结中得以实现和加强，劳伦斯·斯通对此进行了详细论述。由于贵族在很大程度上失去了私人武装力量的拥有，他们成为了宫廷贵族。（这一术语在这里指的是他们政治权力再生产的条件。） 王权基础的结构性变化体现在“议会中的国王”这一说法中。这并不意味着议会已经占有了之前国王的统治权力。正如上文所述，即使在宗教改革之后也不是这种情况。当亨利八世着手将英格兰王国从教廷统治的范围中解放出来时，他将议会用作他政策的“工具”。这一政策让他失去了土地、头衔和租赁特许，但并没有导致国王和女王在未来的宗教政策决策上甚至需要与议会达成一致。 当詹姆士一世在1604年在他召集的汉普顿宫神学会议上坚决拒绝清教徒关于剥夺主教权力的要求时，这发生在枢密院的背景下而不是在议会中。这丝毫没有减少他的决定的影响，也没有引发任何教会或君主自己权力的危机。 “议会中的国王”仍然是他自己的议会，即一个应君主的要求而召集和解散的集会，尽管参与者可能会允许自己对当前的政府方针进行有力的批评，但在伦敦塔被监禁一段时间后，他们会再次出席议会。因此，也适合用复数而不是单数来谈论“议会”。作为独立于君主意志的机构确立议会本身，是一项革命行为。这种议会的制度化直到十八世纪末才得以决定性完成（见下文）。 议会可用于解决争议（以“私人法案”的形式）。它们用于通知国王或女王——如果必要，可以强烈地——他们统治的条件。然而，根据旧制度，在征税问题上确立了一个原则，即在位的君主如果想要有效征收他们要求的税款，必须寻求议会的批准。然而，拒绝这种税款的可能性是相当有限的，且国王在议会外的财政权力实践并未完全消除。 在这里讨论的旧制度阶段，政策的中心并不在议会，甚至不在议会和枢密院的联系中。政策的中心实际上是宫廷。正是在宫廷，基于对赞助的竞争、个人阴谋、亲属关系和严肃的政治信仰，形成了派系，并试图影响国王或女王。有时这些派系只持续很短时间，有时它们持续多年。当议会召开时——作为枢密院的临时扩展——这些宫廷派系试图在那里赢得更广泛的影响。在这方面，大贵族通过利用他们的赞助在下议院成员中行使的特殊影响，对英格兰的治理具有特别重要的意义。 许多作者坚持的观点，即下议院在政治上完全掌握在有影响力的贵族手中，忽视了一个事实，即如果贵族从赞助中获益，他们不一定必须视自己为“被收买的”。贵族们也需要考虑到地方期望，如果他们想在一个或多个郡拥有权力，并以此在宫廷中有影响力。"},{"instruction":"请将“The court, moreover, was not just the centre of policy, it was also a means of policy. By creating a splendid surrounding for the royal person, the court represented the personal structure of rule. In court ceremonial this form of rule was staged afresh each day - with distributed roles. The more that the art of representation developed, in the historical epoch that art historians formerly described as the Renaissance, and the more successfully this art began to spread over time to the various princely and royal courts of Europe, the more impressive was the new definition of personal rule that now materialised. This did not replace the foundation of personal rule in power and religion, it was rather the expression of an established structure of rule, generalised in 'institutional' forms. The magnificence of power not only became itself a power factor, but also a justification presupposed and inherent in it. At the various princely and royal courts, the new social forms of presentation of personal rule, and the external attributes corresponding to these, rapidly acquired quite different forms. We cannot deal in any detail here with this development. The following presentation will be confined to highlighting two circumstances that influenced the structural change in the definition of personal monarchical power in England in a specific fashion. One of the most important political functions of the court lay in the power of conviction that the secular cult of the royal person could wield. For the cer-emonial surrounding the person of the king cast a quite special light on royal decrees. It was of particular significance, therefore, that the cult of the king's person developed in very particular historical circumstances in England. Its origins stretch back to the reign of Henry VIII, thus to a time when opposition to papal rule became integral to the definition of the personal rule of English kings. At first, this definition was not yet irrevocable. Only with the reign of Elizabeth did anti-papism, i.e. the struggle against views and policies that rightly or wrongly were seen as supporting papal rule, become a fixed com-ponent of the politically dominant discourse. This made the eagerness for cor-rect belief into a new (additional) basis for the personal power of the English monarchs - at the end of the sixteenth century. It can be described, with all due caution, as the formation of a plebiscitary element in personal royal rule. The facts that Elizabeth was a woman and that the enemies of 'England' were Catholic were both favourable to this development. When Elizabeth's reign began, the crown had already lost Calais (its last possession on the Continent), the coffers were empty, the Reformation was on the retreat, her claim to the throne was challenged and she was surrounded by Catholic ene-mies. Whether there really did develop between Elizabeth and the English people that 'bond of love' lasting for forty-five years that Garrett Mattingly describes,181 or whether historians too have been taken in by the legend of Good Queen Bess, it remains incontestable that the actual weaknesses of the English crown, and the supposed weaknesses of the unmarried (and hence supposedly virgin) woman, were turned into a strength of her personal rule. This development found expression in the 'Association' that was founded in 1585 for the protection of the royal person in case of an invasion. The for-mation of this Association harked back to forms of medieval vassalage and loyalty, thus to structures of obligation to which the English monarchs had for a long time ceased to lay claim. More significant, however, was the readiness to contribute to the organisation and formation of the militia. The inconve-niences that attended the muster could be borne more readily, not just by the prospect of beer, but also by the fact that it was seen as service to a lady whom many honoured already in her lifetime as the 'faery queen'.182 Elizabeth's lifetime also brought much experience of the harshness of royal caprice, and much rumour of unheard-of presents to the queen's favourites. Yet it was not just painters, poets, courtiers and clerics who idealised the queen. In the popular idealisation of Good Queen Bess - which continued to circulate after her death - a new element was added to the definition of personal royal rule: the idea that this rule was not just the property of a person, but could rather be deployed as a service to the good of all. Under the particular circumstances of female succession to the throne and the wars against 'papists', there rose in late sixteenth-century England the beginnings of the concept of rule that was later summed up elsewhere in the notion of the father or mother of the country. That neither James I nor Charles I could meet this new expectation of royal governing practice must be assumed to have marked discourse about their government in a specific way. (The interpretation offered here is that criticism of the governments of the two early Stuarts should not be understood exclusively as a reaction to the specific content and form that these took, but also referred to the way that in the reign of Elizabeth new ideas of personal rule arose that henceforth became effective requirements.) The 'charms of the sovereign' that blossomed so particularly under Eliza-beth were cultivated at all royal courts of the ancien régime. They became a component of the social forms in which the 'policy of the crown' came about. The cult of the royal person facilitated the prosecution of this policy, while at the same time the presentation of royal splendour and magnificence concealed new elements of crisis within it. In different ways, these dangers became apparent in the reigns of the two Stuart kings. The personal character of royal rule was embodied, among other things, by the fact that royal favour could procure money and land even irrespective of established positions of power and 'justified expectations', also that it was not completely calculable, but continued to depend on individual propensities and moods of the royal person. This arbitrariness of royal favour was a material precondition for the reproduction of the social forms of court life, which was organised around the 'proximity' of a person. It was at the same time - and for England in particular - a structural precondition that could generate crises of government. There were three particular reasons for this: because the court nobles of England were concerned to procure and maintain a political basis in the counties and hence also in the Commons by way of patronage; because the crown could not alienate its creditors, especially the privileged corporations of London; and because new (estate) privileges could damage the maintenance of traditional forms of appropriation and for securing rule. The example of the soap monopoly, which at first sight might seem inciden-tal, already indicates certain difficulties inherent in the policy of privileges. David Underdown's study of the cultural norms and political orientations of the lower orders makes clear the potential scope of these. When Charles I granted courtiers permission to enclose wooded areas and turn them into pri-vate property, or to drain marshes, what was reduced in the first instance were the reproduction prospects of the poorer rural population. If these rebelled, however, they were often supported by the better-off, and even by the members of the local gentry. Modernisations of this kind, moreover, also had an effect on the appropriation opportunities of the more well-placed strata, and above all they reinforced opposition to a policy that favoured outsiders. By granting privileges to courtiers, the crown dealt a blow to traditional structures of reproduction and practice of rule, and proved itself a danger to peace and order in the counties.183 Social conflict thus developed into criticism of the government. Rebellions against enclosure did not express so much an antago-nism between classes, as rather a conflict between greedy upstarts on the one hand and defenders of local order on the other. It was not just in relation to the political requirement and simultaneous political risk of granting privileges that the new emphasis on the personal character of royal power signified both a growth in this power but at the same time a new danger for it. For new possibilities of government crisis arose in so far as monarchs and their advisers could themselves be confused by the representation of royal power, and forget the fact that English kings were powerful only to the extent that they succeeded in winning the support of the great nobles, and above all of the lesser nobility. The forms in which the policies of the crown developed could easily deceive people about the funda-mentally precarious position of centralised monarchical power, which could be mended neither by reform of the crown's own apparatus of government, nor by the reconstruction of administration and justice, nor again by reform of the militia. As a general rule, however, the limits to the royal power of government were not immediately visible. It was possible for example for the king to start a war even if Parliament refused its consent. But in the course of this war - as Charles I had to painfully experience - it became more than clear that taxes, soldiers, shipping, horses and provisions could not be obtained in sufficient quantity if those who represented the government of His Majesty in the counties were not willing to make extraordinary efforts in support of the king's policy. A rationally calculating judgement of royal decrees, however, was blocked both by the traditional notion of obedience and by the newly developing cult of the royal person. Whether a (mainly) practical criticism of royal policy would develop, and on what scale, depended on individual conviction, local structures of the noble hierarchy, and local conditions of ruling practice. From the 1620s, the possibility for divergence between the policy of the court and local expectations of this policy took the form of an opposition between ‘court' and ‘country'. Court in this connection meant the centre of individual interests.184 This criticism was fuelled by James's inclination towards his favourites - which soon became notorious - and the advancement of new peers by way of patronage. In the 1630s, the criticism of favouritism was sup-plemented by opposition to Charles I's strategy of ‘thorough', i.e. the effort to effectively apply the king's (military) policy in the counties. We now reach another of the preconditions for crisis that had newly arisen. For whilst, on the one hand, the limitations of royal executive power can hardly be overrated, and must be constantly stressed against new interpreta-tions that see the letter of the law as expressing political reality, it should also be reiterated on the other hand that as the ancien régime developed, the gener-alised royal power literally came to affect people more directly. The relation-ship of monarch to subject, which was previously characterised chiefly by fiscal exploitation and by commands to refrain from particular actions, was now extended to a relationship of regulating intervention - or at least the beginnings of this. This development is most clear in the command of the crown to practise the correct faith in specific politically controlled modalities. To a degree that was previously unknown, however, the reform of the militia (undertaken by Elizabeth) and the more effective handling of social crises (under Charles I) as prescribed in the ‘books of order', represented such an intervention. It was only because the practice of generalised monarchical power was effectively intensified, and estate exercise of this power was de facto checked to a certain extent, that the policies of the crown could be perceived at certain times as a disturbing factor to the implementation of estate interests in the regions.”翻译为中文","output":"宫廷不仅是政策的中心，也是政策的手段。通过为王室人物营造辉煌的环境，宫廷代表了统治的个人结构。在宫廷仪式中，这种统治形式每天都以分配的角色重新上演。随着代表艺术的发展，在艺术史家们过去称之为文艺复兴的历史时期，这种艺术随时间在欧洲各个王室和亲王宫廷中更成功地传播，个人统治的新定义就显得更加令人印象深刻。这不是取代了个人统治在权力和宗教上的基础，而是这种既定的统治结构的表达，以“制度化”的形式普遍化。权力的辉煌不仅本身成为一种权力因素，而且还是其先验和内在的正当性基础。在各个王室和亲王宫廷，个人统治的新的社会呈现形式及其相应的外在属性迅速获得了各种不同的形式。我们不能详细讨论这一发展。以下陈述将限于强调两种情况，这些情况以特定方式影响了英格兰个人君主权力定义的结构性变化。 宫廷的最重要政治功能之一在于世俗化的王室人物崇拜所能施加的说服力。因此，君主周围的仪式给予了国王法令一种特殊的光环，这一点尤其重要，即在英格兰的特定历史环境下，国王人物崇拜的发展具有特殊意义。其起源可追溯到亨利八世的统治时期，即反对教皇统治成为英格兰国王个人统治定义的一部分的时期。起初，这种定义尚未不可改变。直到伊丽莎白统治时期，反教皇主义——即反对被认为是支持教皇统治的观点和政策的斗争——才成为政治主导话语的固定组成部分。这使得对正确信仰的热切追求成为英格兰君主个人权力的新（附加的）基础——在十六世纪末。这可以非常谨慎地描述为个人王权统治中一种民意元素的形成。 伊丽莎白是女性，以及'英格兰'的敌人是天主教徒，这两个事实都有利于这一发展。当伊丽莎白开始统治时，王室已经失去了加来（其在大陆上的最后一个领地），国库空虚，宗教改革在退却，她对王位的要求受到挑战，她被天主教敌人包围。无论加勒特·马丁利描述的伊丽莎白和英格兰人民之间持续了四十五年的“爱之纽带”是否真的存在，或者历史学家们也被好女王贝丝的传说所迷惑，不可否认的是，英格兰王室的实际弱点，以及单身（因而被假定为处女）女性的所谓弱点，被转化为了她个人统治的优势。 这一发展在1585年为保护王室人物免受入侵而成立的“协会”中得到了体现。这一协会的形成回溯到中世纪的封建义务和忠诚的形式，即那些英格兰君主长期以来已经不再声称的义务结构。然而，更重要的是，为民兵组织和建设做出贡献的意愿。集结时伴随的不便之处可以被更容易地忍受，不仅是因为啤酒的前景，而且是因为它被视为为许多人在她在世时就已敬仰为“仙女皇后”的女士服务。 伊丽莎白在世时也有许多关于王室任性的严酷经历，以及关于女王宠臣获得前所未闻的礼物的传闻。然而，不仅是画家、诗人、宫廷人和神职人员理想化了女王。在民间对好女王贝丝的理想化形象中——这种形象在她去世后仍在流传——为个人王权统治的定义增添了一个新元素：这种统治不仅是一个人的财产，而且可以被用作服务于所有人的利益。在女性继承王位和对抗“教皇党”的战争特殊背景下，在十六世纪晚期的英格兰出现了后来在其他地方总结为国家之父或国家之母的统治观念的萌芽。詹姆士一世和查理一世未能满足这一新的王权统治实践期望被认为以特定方式标志着他们的政府的话语（这里提出的解释是，对两位早期斯图亚特君主政府的批评不应仅被理解为对这些政府的具体内容和形式的反应，而是也涉及到在伊丽莎白统治期间出现的新的个人统治观念，从此成为有效的要求）。 在伊丽莎白的精心培养下格外繁荣的“君主的魅力”，在旧制度的所有王室宫廷中都被培养。它们成为“皇室政策”的社会形式发展的组成部分。王室人物的崇拜促进了这一政策的实施，同时王室辉煌和豪华的展示也掩盖了其中的新的危机元素。这些危机在两位斯图亚特国王的统治期间以不同方式变得明显。 王权的个人特性体现在，即使不考虑既定的权力地位和“正当期望”，王室的恩宠也能获得金钱和土地，这种恩宠并不完全可预计，而且继续取决于王室人物的个人倾向和情绪。这种王室恩宠的任意性是宫廷生活社会形式再生产的物质前提，这种生活围绕着一个人的“亲近”组织。同时——对英格兰而言尤其如此——它也是可能引发政府危机的结构性前提条件。这有三个特别原因：因为英格兰的宫廷贵族试图通过赞助在郡和因此在下议院获得并维护政治基础；因为皇冠不能疏远其债权人，尤其是伦敦的特权公司；以及因为新的（阶层）特权可能损害传统的占有形式和统治安全性的维护。 首先看起来可能是次要的肥皂专利案例就表明了特权政策固有的某些困难。大卫·昂德伍德关于下层阶级的文化规范和政治取向的研究明确了这些的潜在范围。当查理一世授权宫廷人物围起林地并将其转变为私有财产，或是抽干沼泽时，首先受到影响的是较贫困的农村人口的再生产前景。然而，如果这些人反抗，他们往往得到了较富裕者甚至当地贵族的支持。此外，这种现代化还影响了较为优越阶层的占有机会，并且最重要的是，它加强了对外来人优惠政策的反对。通过向宫廷人物授予特权，皇冠打击了传统的再生产和统治实践结构，并证明自己对郡的和平与秩序构成威胁。社会冲突因此发展成对政府的批评。反对圈地行为的叛乱并不是表达了阶级之间的对立，而是贪婪的暴发户与捍卫地方秩序者之间的冲突。 新强调王权个人特性不仅意味着这种权力的增长，同时也意味着对它的新风险，并不仅仅在于授予特权的政治要求和同时的政治风险。因为君主和他们的顾问可能本身就被王权的代表所迷惑，并忘记了英格兰国王之所以强大，只是因为他们成功地赢得了大贵族的支持，尤其是小贵族的支持。皇室政策的形式很容易使人误解中央集权王权的根本不稳定地位，这既不能通过改革国王自己的政府机构，也不能通过重建行政和司法机构，更不能通过改革民兵来弥补。然而，通常情况下，王权政府的局限性并不立即显现。 例如，即使议会拒绝同意，国王也可以发动战争。但在这场战争的过程中——正如查理一世不得不痛苦地体验到的——如果那些代表陛下在郡治理的人不愿意为国王的政策做出特殊努力，就无法获得足够数量的税收、士兵、船只、马匹和补给。 然而，对国王法令的理性评判既被传统的服从观念所阻碍，也被新兴的王室人物崇拜所阻碍。是否会发展出对王室政策的（主要是）实践性批评，以及这种批评的规模大小，取决于个人信念、地方贵族等级结构和地方统治实践条件。 从1620年代开始，法庭政策与地方对此政策的期望之间的分歧采取了“朝廷”与“乡村”之间对立的形式。“朝廷”在这里意味着个人利益的中心。这种批评由詹姆士对他的宠臣的倾向——这很快就变得臭名昭著——以及通过赞助晋升新贵族而激发。在1630年代，对宠臣主义的批评被查理一世的“彻底”战略的反对所补充，即努力在郡有效实施国王的（军事）政策。 我们现在达到了新出现的危机前提之一。因为一方面，王权行政权力的局限性几乎不可能被高估，并且必须不断地强调这一点以反对新的解释，这些解释将法律的字面意义视为政治现实的反映，另一方面，也应该重申，随着旧制度的发展，普遍王权实际上直接影响到了人们。君主与臣民之间原本主要以财政剥削和禁止特定行为为特征的关系，现在扩展到了调节干预的关系——或者至少是这种干预的开始。这一发展在英格兰王室命令以特定政治控制的方式实践正确信仰上最为明显。然而，伊丽莎白对民兵的改革（已经实施）和查理一世按照“命令书”规定更有效地处理社会危机，代表了这种干预。只有因为普遍王权的实践实际上得到了加强，并且阶层行使这种权力在一定程度上受到了事实上的限制，皇室的政策才能在某些时候被视为地区实施阶层利益的干扰因素。"},{"instruction":"What is the song head over heels by tears for fears about","output":"\\"Head Over Heels\\" by Tears for Fears is a song that explores themes of infatuation and the complexity of emotions involved in a romantic relationship. Released in 1985 as part of their second album, \\"Songs from the Big Chair,\\" the track features engaging melodies and heartfelt lyrics that convey a deep sense of longing and vulnerability. The lyrics \\"I wanted to be with you alone / And talk about the weather\\" reflect the songwriter's desire for a private, intimate connection, diverging from mundane conversations to a more profound emotional exchange. The recurrent phrase \\"Head over heels,\\" a common idiom indicating a deep, uncontrollable love, emphasizes the intense feelings the protagonist has for their love interest. The song’s narrative structure, coupled with its catchy chorus and emotive delivery, has made it an enduring hit and a memorable piece of the 1980s music lexicon. At its core, \\"Head Over Heels\\" captures the exhilarating yet tumultuous nature of falling deeply in love, marking it as a timeless piece about human emotion and connection."},{"instruction":"I’m working on a manga and I’d like to tell you about the setting and main character.","output":"I would love to hear about your manga's setting and its main character! Please tell me all about them."},{"instruction":"So, the setting takes place in 1998 in New York. It takes place between August and September. It's inspired by Drive (2011) and Gone in 60 Seconds. There is a part where our main character ends up working for the police because of a crime, reckless driving and possible drug trafficking.","output":"That setting and theme sound incredibly engaging! A 1998 New York backdrop offers a distinct urban landscape and cultural atmosphere that can deeply enrich your narrative. Drawing inspiration from films like \\"Drive\\" (2011) and \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" gives you a strong base in terms of action and high-stakes drama, especially in the realm of car culture and crime. The timeline between August and September can provide an intense, compact storyline where the heat of the summer could serve as a metaphor for the escalating tension in the plot. Incorporating elements such as reckless driving and potential drug trafficking adds layers of complexity and danger, creating a fertile ground for character development and moral dilemmas. The twist where your main character ends up working for the police adds an intriguing element of redemption and conflict. It suggests a narrative where lines between right and wrong are blurred, offering a rich exploration of character motivations, ethics, and perhaps the idea of seeking a second chance or redemption. Could you tell me more about your main character? Their background, personality, and how they find themselves in this situation would be fascinating to hear more about, as well as any specific challenges or conflicts they might face as the story unfolds."},{"instruction":"So, first things first, our main character. His name is Jack. He has short blonde hair and green eyes. He wears a brown varsity jacket with cream-colored sleeves, a light blue t-shirt, jeans and brown driving gloves. He is in his early 20s, around 24. He drives a black 1965 Shelby GT350R with gray stripes. He’s a procrastinator, loves to relax by watching movies, sightseeing or just driving around. He’s ambidextrous. He is trying to quit smoking by occasionally eating goldfish crackers.","output":"Jack sounds like a compelling and relatable character, bridging the gap between a cool, collected demeanor and personal vices he's struggling to overcome. His appearance—marked by the iconic brown varsity jacket and driving gloves—gives him a classic, timeless feel that aligns well with the car culture and action-packed essence of your story. The specific choice of a black 1965 Shelby GT350R with gray stripes as his vehicle not only emphasizes his connection to the world of high-stakes driving but also serves as a symbol of his character: rare, fast, and with a story to tell. His personality traits, such as being a procrastinator who loves leisure activities, contrast intriguingly with the presumed adrenaline-fueled and risky nature of his driving and the illegal activities he's associated with. This duality offers ample space for character development and depth, making readers or viewers eager to understand how he navigates the drastic shift from his relaxed lifestyle to high tension scenarios. The detail about him trying to quit smoking by eating goldfish crackers is a quirky, humanizing touch that adds to his relatability. It's those small, personal battles juxtaposed with the larger external conflicts that make characters multidimensional and engaging. Given Jack's situation—working for the police amidst a background of crime, reckless driving, and potential drug trafficking—there are several directions you could explore. How does someone who enjoys freedom and disdains structure adapt to being in a position where he might have to follow orders or work against his own kind? What motivates him to keep going despite the risks, and how does his past influence his actions and decisions in the present? Additionally, Jack's ambidexterity could be portrayed as a metaphor for his ability to navigate two worlds—the law and the underworld. How will this skill and his personal struggles play into the larger narrative, especially when faced with moral dilemmas or when he's forced to make quick, critical decisions? Exploring these aspects can deepen Jack's character and make the storyline even more compelling. How do you envision his journey unfolding, and what are the key themes you want to explore through his experiences?"},{"instruction":"Not much is known about his past, we know that he has a younger brother who owns a small store. He grew up somewhere in Wisconsin. He performed exceptionally in terms of academia but had a poor disciplinary record (regarding his math teacher, he was fine with other teachers) when he finished college. He was good in physics and P.E. He took a interest in cars to keep his mind away from his… troubled family life. Also, he once mentioned that he wanted to become a boxer as a kid but forgot about it when he was 16.","output":"Jack's background presents a rich tapestry from which to draw as you delve deeper into his psyche and motivations. Growing up in Wisconsin and then moving to the bustling, frenetic world of 1998 New York sets Jack up as someone who's no stranger to change and adapting to different environments. It provides a subtle narrative on how one's origins shape them, but also on the possibility of reinvention, a theme that seems to resonate with Jack's character arc. His relationship with his younger brother, who owns a small store, introduces a familial connection that could serve as a grounding force or point of contention within the story. This dynamic allows you to explore the complexities of sibling relationships, especially when juxtaposed against the backdrop of Jack's \\"troubled family life.\\" It opens avenues for emotional storytelling, perhaps touching upon themes of loyalty, protection, redemption, and the search for belonging. Jack's academic prowess, especially in physics and P.E., juxtaposed with his poor disciplinary record, paints him as a character with potential and intelligence but one who struggles against constraints and authority. This anti-authoritarian streak might feed into his disdain for strict rules, making his forced alliance with the police even more conflict-laden and compelling. His interest in cars as a refuge from family troubles can be an emotive thread that ties into his sense of identity and freedom, providing a tangible connection to happier moments and perhaps a desire to regain some control over his life. The detail about Jack once aspiring to become a boxer but abandoning this dream at 16 could symbolize a lost sense of direction or the first of many compromises or losses Jack had to face. It might serve as an interesting parallel to his current situation, where he finds himself coerced into a corner and forced to fight in a different kind of ring—underpinning themes of struggle, resilience, and perhaps the quest to reclaim lost dreams or forge new ones. Incorporating these elements, Jack's character development can be deeply intertwined with the unraveling of the story. His journey can reflect his internal battle—a fight for autonomy against the backdrop of enforced collaboration with the police, and a quest for redemption or a new path in the shadow of past rebellions and present-day illegal entanglements. How does Jack leverage his strengths and confront his weaknesses? And in what ways do his origins and past decisions shape his actions in the face of current adversities and alliances? Exploring these facets will not only flesh out Jack as a multidimensional character but also imbue the narrative with compelling, psychologically rich themes that resonate with readers. How do you see these aspects of his past influencing his decisions and relationships in the narrative?"},{"instruction":"Okay, time to talk about his younger brother. His name is Chris. He has short brown hair and glasses. He has dark blue eyes. He wears light blue jeans, sneakers and a white-blue Hawaiian shirt. He is around 20-21 years old. He owns a small convenience store. He drives a light green sedan but he is planning to get himself a Dodge Ram. He is quite nerdy and when he’s on break, he’s either seen reading a comic book, listening to music or watching something on the small TV on his counter.","output":"Chris provides a vivid contrast to Jack, and this dynamic between the brothers has the potential to add depth and vitality to your manga. Visually and in terms of lifestyle, they're quite distinct from one another, yet there's an underlying connection that could serve as an emotional cornerstone of your narrative. Chris, with his short brown hair, glasses, and penchant for Hawaiian shirts, projects a more relaxed, perhaps more content vibe compared to Jack’s restless, edgy demeanor. His choice of attire and his hobbies position him as someone who appreciates the simpler pleasures in life—an aspect that can bring warmth and a sense of normalcy to the story. At 20-21, owning a small convenience store suggests Chris is responsible and somewhat entrepreneurial. This setup can serve as a plot device to bring the brothers together, potentially using the store as a key location where significant interactions occur. It could be a safe haven, a place of conflict, or a crucial meeting point that ties into larger plot elements. His aspiration to upgrade from a light green sedan to a Dodge Ram indicates a desire for growth or change, reflecting perhaps a more subtle or personal journey compared to Jack’s. Chris’s nerdy tendencies open avenues for lighter, more relatable moments interspersed among the high tension of the primary narrative. His hobbies can also serve as a bridge to explore various subcultures of the late '90s, adding texture and authenticity to your setting. Moreover, they could become relevant to the plot in unexpected ways—perhaps a comic book inspires a crucial idea, or knowledge gleaned from his interest areas becomes pivotal in a crisis moment. The brothers’ relationship, with its potential for both camaraderie and conflict, can be a driving force in the narrative. Their differences could lead to friction or misunderstanding, especially when juxtaposed against their shared history and current circumstances involving Jack’s entanglement with the law. On the other hand, Chris's more grounded, optimistic outlook could provide a balance to Jack’s riskier, more tumultuous path, possibly serving as a moral compass or offering a fresh perspective on Jack’s dilemmas. Their interactions could explore themes of brotherhood, loyalty, and the ways in which we seek to protect those we love, sometimes from themselves. How does Chris view Jack’s involvement with the police and the dangers it entails? Is he aware of the full extent of Jack’s activities and struggles? And how does his more stable, if unassuming, lifestyle influence Jack, especially as he navigates the perilous world he's become entangled in? Exploring Chris's character and his relationship with Jack offers a rich tapestry of emotional and narrative possibilities.

She usually wears a dark blue hoodie but she is sometimes seen wearing a nice black business suit with dress shoes because she finds heels to be uncomfortable. She lives with her parents but she has plans to move out somewhere in like Pennsylvania. Her father is a writer and her mom is a doctor.","output":"Corey sounds like a character with both depth and relatability, who could add significant dimensions to the story and to Jack’s personal journey. Her appearance and fashion choices hint at a pragmatic personality with a sense of individuality—comfort and practicality seem to guide her wardrobe decisions, suggesting a no-nonsense character who values functionality over trends. This trait could create interesting dynamics, especially in contrast to the possibly more impulsive or style-conscious aspects of other characters. At 20, living with her parents while planning to move out, Corey is at a crossroads that many readers might find familiar. Her ambition to relocate, specifically to Pennsylvania, opens narrative paths exploring themes of transition, independence, and the search for one’s place in the world. It also sets up a potential conflict or tension in her relationship with Jack, given his complicated situation. Their paths could intersect at a crucial point in Corey's life, making their connection all the more pivotal. The backgrounds of her parents reveal a home environment rich in intellectual and caring influences, which likely contributes to her character's depth. A writer father introduces the possibility of a creative, perhaps somewhat unconventional upbringing, while a doctor mother suggests a disciplined, caring environment. These influences could explain Corey's practical yet ambitious outlook. They may also have instilled in her a strong sense of ethics and responsibility, traits that could both attract her to Jack and cause friction given his current entanglements. Corey’s storyline provides an opportunity to explore the sometimes difficult balance between personal aspirations and the complexities of relationships, particularly one involving someone like Jack, who's caught up in a web of legal and moral challenges. How she navigates her goals alongside Jack’s evolving situation can offer readers a meaningful narrative about growth, sacrifice, and the power of support. Given Corey's practicality, her dynamics with Jack might also serve to ground his more reckless tendencies, offering a stabilizing influence or pushing him towards reflection and change. Conversely, Jack's world could challenge Corey's plans and perceptions, testing her resilience and perhaps pushing her toward unexpected growth or a reevaluation of what she truly desires from life. Your depiction of Corey’s integration into the story has the potential to bring out new facets of Jack's character while also navigating the intricacies of young love amid personal upheaval. How will her dreams and sensibilities mesh or clash with Jack's current lifestyle and choices? And in what ways will her presence influence the course of Jack's redemption arc or descent? Including Corey as a fully realized character with her own ambitions, background, and personality ensures that the relationship adds to the realism and emotional depth of your narrative. How do you envision Corey’s character development, and how will her relationship with Jack evolve throughout the story?"},{"instruction":"They meet on the subway. Jack is going home after a long day and Corey is coming home from work. Corey complains about her annoying colleague and Jack complains about his car being impounded. Corey talks about her job and Jack talks about his part-time job and his plan to get a real job. Corey also mentions that she's also trying to quit smoking but she's using tic-tacs.","output":"The subway encounter between Jack and Corey serves as a beautifully organic and relatable meeting point for two characters on seemingly separate paths. The cramped, transient space of a subway where everyone is momentarily paused in their journey symbolizes a crossroads, making it a fitting backdrop for their first interaction. Their mutual frustration—Corey with her annoying colleague and Jack with his impounded car—serves as common ground, breaking down barriers and allowing for an authentic exchange. Their conversation, moving from immediate irritations to broader aspects of their lives, mirrors the way relationships often evolve, from superficial commonalities to deeper, more personal revelations. Corey talking about her job and her aspirations, contrasted with Jack's admission of his current job struggles and his hope for something more stable, sets the stage for a relationship built on mutual understanding and support. Their shared attempt to quit smoking, albeit with different strategies (tic-tacs for Corey, goldfish crackers for Jack), adds a layer of personal struggle and vulnerability to both characters. This detail not only humanizes them further but also creates a shared goal that might serve as a bonding point throughout the narrative. It's a subtle nod to the idea that personal improvement and the journey to overcome one's weaknesses can sometimes benefit from companionship and empathy. This initial meeting already lays the groundwork for a dynamic where Corey and Jack can grow individually and as a couple. Corey, with her practicality and ambition, and Jack, with his dreams and current complications, can find in each other the support and understanding they might not have known they needed. Their interactions can challenge each other's views and potentially encourage personal growth, offering Jack a glimpse into a less tumultuous life path and offering Corey a perspective that pushes her out of her comfort zone, testing her ambitions and plans. As their relationship develops, the narrative can explore how love can both complicate and simplify life's challenges. The complexities of Jack's situation with the law and his involvement in crime will undoubtedly test Corey's pragmatic approach to life and plans for the future. Conversely, Corey's influence might offer Jack a steadier path forward, moving him away from the brink and toward a more hopeful horizon. Their burgeoning relationship, sparked on the subway, could serve as a powerful narrative thread, weaving together themes of redemption, aspiration, and the transformative power of human connection. How they navigate their differences, support each other's struggles, and face external pressures and dilemmas can make for a compelling and emotionally resonant storyline. How do you envision this relationship influencing the course of your story?

This encounter not only brings the realities of his lifestyle into sharp relief but it also serves as a turning point, marking the beginning of his reluctant involvement with the police. The detective's decision to deputize Jack on the spot for a pursuit, albeit unconventional and ethically questionable, introduces an element of unpredictability and moral ambiguity to the law enforcement characters in your manga. It suggests a world where the lines between right and wrong are blurred, and where the ends might justify the means for some. This encounter could lead to a compelling narrative thread, where Jack, with his unique set of skills, finds himself pulled deeper into a web of crime and justice than he ever intended to go. Following this incident, the dynamic between Jack and the detective can evolve in various intriguing directions. The detective might see potential in Jack—a chance to utilize his driving skills for undercover operations or in pursuits, thinking him a valuable asset despite his initial criminality. On the other hand, Jack might see this as an opportunity to avoid harsher punishment or may be motivated by a more personal, yet-to-be-revealed reason to agree to work with the police. This setup offers a wealth of narrative potential: 1. **Jack’s Moral Dilemma:** Torn between his newfound role assisting the police and his innate desire for freedom and disregard for the rules, Jack must navigate his new reality. His interactions with the detective and the police force could test his principles, challenge his perceptions of justice, and force him to confront his own past actions. 2. **Redemption Arc:** This forced alliance might serve as a catalyst for Jack's personal growth. Working with the police, even under duress, could lead to moments of self-reflection and opportunities for Jack to prove his worth beyond his driving skills—perhaps even redeeming himself in his own eyes and those of others. 3. **Thrilling Pursuits and Undercover Operations:** Jack's driving prowess provides the perfect foundation for exhilarating car chases and undercover missions set against the backdrop of New York's diverse cityscape.

The dynamic between Ethan and both Victor and Jack promises rich narrative possibilities. With Victor, there could be a longstanding partnership built on mutual respect despite their differing personalities, a relationship that knows how to navigate the grumpy waters of each other's temperament. Enter Jack, a wildcard that could test their partnership, challenging both detectives in new ways. Ethan's martial arts background and his grumpy, sarcastic demeanor could provide both humorous and tense moments, especially in Jack's efforts to prove himself or in the heat of action where Ethan's combat skills and unreliable Beretta come into play. Ethan's character provides a tangible connection to the past—both through his father's influence and his own long career—offering a commentary on the evolving nature of crime, justice, and detective work. His relationship with Jack could develop in several ways; he might see Jack as a nuisance or a risk, given his impulsive nature and criminal past, or he could recognize potential in Jack, viewing him through a lens tinted with his own experiences and perhaps a desire to mentor, however reluctantly. Incorporating Ethan as a fully fleshed-out character alongside Victor and Jack enriches the narrative, infusing it with themes of legacy, mentorship, and redemption. The interactions among this trio, each coming from different backgrounds and bearing their own scars and stories, can provide a wealth of drama, humor, and heart as they navigate the complexities of their personal and professional lives against the gritty backdrop of 1998 New York. How Ethan's dry humor, martial arts skills, and cynicism influence the story’s unfolding, particularly in his dealings with Jack and partnership with Victor, could be one of the most compelling aspects of your manga.

However, the logic within your program, particularly within the loops and BFS function, does not correctly identify when and how many edges to add to achieve this. Your approach to repeatedly performing BFS and adding connections appears overly complex and often leads to confusion. A more straightforward approach to solving the problem -- finding the minimum number of roads needed to make all buildings interconnected -- involves finding the number of disconnected components in the graph. Once identified, the number of roads needed to connect all components fully is simply the total number of components minus 1. This simplification works because connecting any two disconnected components requires only one new road. Here's a corrected version of the program, simplified and focused on identifying disconnected components and then connecting them: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <queue> using namespace std; void add_edge(vector<vector<int>>& adj, int u, int v) { adj[u-1].push_back(v-1); // Adjusting for 1-based index adj[v-1].push_back(u-1); } // BFS to mark all reachable nodes from 'start' void bfs(int start, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) { queue<int> q; q.push(start); visited[start] = true; while (!q.empty()) { int node = q.front(); q.pop(); for (int neighbour : adj[node]) { if (!visited[neighbour]) { visited[neighbour] = true; q.push(neighbour); } } } } int main() { int vertices, edges; cin >> vertices >> edges; vector<vector<int>> adj(vertices); vector<bool> visited(vertices, false); // Input the existing edges for (int i = 0; i < edges; ++i) { int u, v; cin >> u >> v; add_edge(adj, u, v); } // Find all disconnected components vector<int> representatives; // To keep track of at least one node per component for (int i = 0; i < vertices; ++i) { if (!visited[i]) { bfs(i, adj, visited); representatives.push_back(i); } } // Print the minimum number of new roads needed and the connections between representatives cout << representatives.size() - 1 << endl; for (int i = 1; i < representatives.size(); ++i) { // Adjusting back to 1-based index when printing cout << representatives[0] + 1 << \\" \\" << representatives[i] + 1 << endl; } return 0; } \`\`\` This approach finds the minimum number of new paths needed by: 1. Identifying all disconnected components. 2. Connecting these components in a chain-like manner, requiring only N-1 additional paths where N is the number of disconnected components."},{"instruction":"explain cout << representatives[0] + 1 << \\" \\" << representatives[i] + 1 << endl;","output":"The line \`cout << representatives[0] + 1 << \\" \\" << representatives[i] + 1 << endl;\` in the code is part of the output section that prints which new roads need to be constructed to make all the buildings in Vindhya complex accessible from each other. To break it down: - \`representatives\` is a vector that stores at least one building (node) from each disconnected component of the graph (where the graph represents the complex, and nodes represent buildings). After performing the breadth-first search (BFS), each time a new, previously unvisited component is found, one node from that component (the starting node for that BFS invocation) is added to this vector. - \`representatives[0]\` refers to the first building in the first disconnected component. The assumption here, based on the solution strategy, is that we're going to iteratively connect all disconnected components to this first component, thus making the entire graph (complex) connected. - \`representatives[i]\` refers to the first building of the ith disconnected component found during the BFS. - The \`+ 1\` adjustment is made because, in the coded solution, the graph is treated as 0-indexed (where nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1). However, the problem statement seems to imply a 1-indexed format (where nodes are numbered from 1 to N). Therefore, when displaying the result, the program converts back from 0-indexing to 1-indexing to match the expected output format detailed in the problem statement. - The \`cout\` line effectively prints a pair of buildings \`(representatives[0], representatives[i])\` that should be connected by a new road. The first printed connection (\`representatives[0] + 1\`) remains constant, signifying that every new road is being connected to this initial component, thereby ensuring all buildings become accessible from each other. The second part of the connection changes with each iteration, representing a link from the first component to each of the other initially disconnected components. Hence, this line is instrumental in outputting the pairs of buildings between which new roads should be constructed to ensure full connectivity within the complex, adhering to the problem's requirement of ensuring that one can travel between any two buildings after adding the minimum necessary new roads."},{"instruction":"#include<bits/stdc++.h> #include<vector> #include<queue> using namespace std; void add_edge(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int u, int v) { adj[u].push_back(v); } void bfs(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int start, vector<int> &vis) { queue<int> myqueue; vis[start]=true; myqueue.push(start); while(!myqueue.empty()) { int curr = myqueue.front(); myqueue.pop(); for(int neighbour:adj[curr]) { if(!vis[neighbour]) { vis[neighbour]=true; myqueue.push(neighbour); } } } } int main() { int n,m; cin>>n>>m; vector<vector<int>> adj(n); vector<int> vis(n,0); for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) { int u, v; cin >> u >> v; add_edge(adj, u, v); } vector<int>arr; for(int i=0;i<n;i++) { if(!vis[i]) { bfs(adj,i,vis); arr.push_back(i);} } int cnt=arr.size(); cout<<cnt<<\\"n\\"; for(int i=0;i<cnt-1;i++) { cout<<arr[i]<<\\" \\"<<arr[i+1]<<\\"n\\"; } return 0; } seg fault","output":"The segmentation fault in your code is likely because of an off-by-one error that arises from how you treat indices when adding edges to your adjacency list. When reading the vertices \`u\` and \`v\` for edges, if your input data is 1-indexed (nodes numbered from 1 up to \`n\`) but you store them directly into a 0-indexed \`adj\` vector (where indices run from 0 up to \`n-1\`), you will access out-of-range indices, leading to undefined behavior including segmentation faults. To fix this, when you add edges, adjust the indices to be 0-based if your input assumes 1-based numbering for nodes. Furthermore, ensure that the BFS function treats the vertices correctly according to their zero-based indexing. I will adjust your \`add_edge\` and main function calls to reflect this correction. Also, note that in the provided code, you are assuming a directed graph implementation since \`add_edge\` only adds a path from \`u\` to \`v\` and not vice versa. If you intend for the graph to be undirected (which is often the case when needing to ensure connectivity among all nodes), you should add the reverse edge as well. Here's the updated code with corrections: \`\`\`cpp #include<bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; void add_edge(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int u, int v) { // Assuming 1-based input, subtract 1 for 0-based indexing adj[u-1].push_back(v-1); adj[v-1].push_back(u-1); // Add this line if the graph is undirected } void bfs(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int start, vector<int> &vis) { queue<int> myqueue; vis[start] = true; myqueue.push(start); while (!myqueue.empty()) { int curr = myqueue.front(); myqueue.pop(); for (int neighbour : adj[curr]) { if (!vis[neighbour]) { vis[neighbour] = true; myqueue.push(neighbour); } } } } int main() { int n, m; cin >> n >> m; vector<vector<int>> adj(n); vector<int> vis(n,0); for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) { int u, v; cin >> u >> v; add_edge(adj, u, v); } vector<int> arr; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { if (!vis[i]) { bfs(adj, i, vis); // Adjust for 1-based output arr.push_back(i + 1); } } int cnt = arr.size() - 1; cout << cnt << \\"n\\"; for (int i = 0; i < cnt; i++) { cout << arr[i] << \\" \\" << arr[i + 1] << \\"n\\"; } return 0; } \`\`\` Key changes and considerations: - Adjusted \`add_edge\` to compensate for 1-based input indexing by subtracting 1 when adding to the adjacency list. - If the graph is intended to be undirected, \`add_edge\` now properly adds both \`(u-1, v-1)\` and \`(v-1, u-1)\` to \`adj\`. - In \`main()\`, when adding nodes to \`arr\`, the code adjusts for 1-based numbering (since the problem likely defines vertices using 1-based indexing) by adding 1. - Revised \`int cnt = arr.size() - 1;\` and its usage, since the problem seems to be about connecting separate components with additional edges. Remember, if your input data and problem statement assume 1-based indexing, you'll need to be cautious to translate between 1-based and 0-based indexing when storing and accessing data in C++ data structures, and likewise when outputting information."},{"instruction":"correct this part for(int i=0;i<cnt-1;i++) { cout<<arr[i]<<\\" \\"<<arr[i+1]<<\\"n\\"; }","output":"To address your request, it seems like you're pointing towards the loop that is supposed to print pairs of consecutive elements from the \`arr\` array. From your context, \`arr\` holds the starting node of each disconnected component in the graph, and your intent is to connect these components to make the graph fully connected. Given that, the corrected part of the loop should iterate correctly through the \`arr\` and print pairs of nodes between which you are \\"imagining\\" or \\"actually\\" adding an edge to ensure the graph's connectivity. However, the initial suggestion I made could have been slightly clearer in respect to the context of your problem. If \`arr\` is holding the first node found in each disconnected component and if your goal is to print how you connect these components, you need to connect the end of one component to the start of the next to minimize the number of new roads. If you're using the corrected version from my previous response, then connecting the representative nodes from each disconnected component directly as was intended in the code is a valid strategy when ensuring all parts of the graph become interconnected (essentially forming a line or chain of connections between the components). Notice the subtle correction in my previous response which led to this approach. Let's highlight the loop in question based on the corrected understanding: \`\`\`cpp for(int i = 0; i < cnt; i++) { cout << arr[i] << \\" \\" << arr[i+1] << \\"n\\"; } \`\`\` Given the corrected context where \`arr.size() - 1\` is considered for calculating \`cnt\`, yet you aim to print pairs up to the last element, it appears the loop condition should instead cater to not accessing beyond the array's bounds. Therefore, assuming \`arr\` contains 1-based indices of representative nodes from each disconnected component and you plan to connect these components linearly, it seems there was a misunderstanding in my interpretation of \`cnt\`. If \`cnt\` actually equals \`arr.size() - 1\`, the loop should not access \`arr[i+1]\` when \`i\` is \`cnt - 1\` (to prevent out-of-bounds access). To clarify based on the standard approach: \`\`\`cpp // Correct loop iteration for connecting components for(int i = 0; i < cnt; i++) { // Now, this ensures there's no access beyond the array's bounds cout << arr[i] << \\" \\" << arr[i+1] << \\"n\\"; } \`\`\` However, you should ensure the expression that sets the value of \`cnt\` is aligned with how you intend to use it, especially considering the possibility of off-by-one errors. Given the adjustments and clarifications: - \`cnt\` should represent the total connections you're about to make, which is indeed \`arr.size() - 1\` if \`arr\` holds nodes from each disconnected component you discovered. - The loop iterates correctly under the assumption that \`cnt\` has been adjusted correctly before the loop. If you meant \`cnt = arr.size()\`, then the original loop condition \`i < cnt - 1\` makes sense to avoid out-of-bound errors. However, based on the latest clarification, it should be \`for(int i = 0; i < cnt; i++)\`. Hence there was a bit of confusion in the explanation linked to your exact implementation needs. The correction focuses on connecting each discovered component sequentially, ensuring no segment faults by keeping array accesses within bounds."},{"instruction":"на множествах a={1,2,3,4}, b={a,b,c},c={1,2,3} заданы отношения rab={(2,a) (2,b)(2,c)(1,a)(3,b)(4,c)}, sbc={(a3) (b,2)(c,1)(b,1)(c,2)} . найдите композицию sbc на rab","output":"Для того чтобы найти композицию отношений ( S circ R ), нужно определить все пары ( (x, z) ), для которых существует такой элемент ( y ), что пара ( (x, y) ) принадлежит отношению ( R ), а пара ( (y, z) ) принадлежит отношению ( S ).

Это значительно упрощает систему проводки, снижает вес и повышает надёжность обмена данными между различными системами управления автомобильными функциями. # Технические характеристики - **Физический уровень**: CAN использует два провода для передачи данных — CAN High и CAN Low. Поддерживается дифференциальная передача сигнала, что повышает устойчивость к электромагнитным помехам. - **Скорость передачи**: скорость может варьироваться от очень низких значений (125 кбит/с) до 1 Мбит/с для коротких расстояний. - **Протокол**: основан на принципе множественного доступа с контролем приоритетов сообщений (CSMA/CA). Это означает, что если два устройства начинают передачу одновременно, устройство с сообщением более высокого приоритета получит доступ к шине. - **Форматы кадров**: CAN-протокол определяет четыре типа кадров — данные, запрос данных (RTR), ошибка и перегрузка. - **ID сообщений**: кадры данных и кадры запроса данных имеют уникальные идентификаторы, которые определяют приоритет каждого сообщения на шине. - **Надежность**: протокол включает механизмы обнаружения и коррекции ошибок. # Версии - **CAN 2.0A (Standard CAN)**: Использует 11-битные идентификаторы, что позволяет до 2,048 различных сообщений. - **CAN 2.0B (Extended CAN)**: Вводит 29-битные идентификаторы, значительно увеличивая количество уникальных сообщений. # Применение Первоначально разработанная для автомобильной промышленности, CAN широко применяется и в других сферах из-за своей надежности, простоты и эффективности. Например, в промышленных контрольно-измерительных системах, медицинском оборудовании, в системах управления на железной дороге и многих других. # Примечания Стандарт не указывает физический уровень (такой как конкретные характеристики кабеля, разъемы), что позволяет разработчикам адаптировать систему под конкретные условия эксплуатации, сохраняя при этом совместимость на уровне протокола."},{"instruction":"In this javascript for leaflet.js I wish to add a clickevent for a button parksButton which works like the roadsbutton but which will fill a grid square green when clicked rather than black - 'var map = L.tileLayer('', { maxZoom: 20, subdomains: ['mt0', 'mt1', 'mt2', 'mt3'] }); // initialize the map on the \\"map\\" div with a given center and zoom var map = L.map('map', { layers: [map] }).setView([-5.0750, 19.4250], 13); // Flag to track grid click event state var gridClickEnabled = false; // Function to handle square click and update color function squareClick(e) { if (gridClickEnabled) { var clickedSquare = e.target.feature; clickedSquare.properties = {fillColor: 'black', fillOpacity: 1 }; // Change color to black e.target.setStyle(clickedSquare.properties); // Update style on map } } // Get a reference to the button element var roadsButton = document.getElementById(\\"roadsButton\\"); // Function to toggle grid click event function toggleGridClick() { gridClickEnabled = !gridClickEnabled; // Toggle flag if (gridClickEnabled) { map.eachLayer(function(layer) { // Check for existing square grid layer if (layer.feature && layer.feature.geometry.type === 'Polygon') { layer.on('click', squareClick); // Add click event listener if grid found roadsButton.innerText = \\"Roads On\\"; // Update button text } }); } else { map.eachLayer(function(layer) { // Remove click event listener from squares layer.off('click', squareClick); }); roadsButton.innerText = \\"Roads Off\\"; // Update button text back } } // Add click event listener to the button roadsButton.addEventListener(\\"click\\", toggleGridClick); // Square Grid var bbox = [19.35, -5, 19.5, -5.15]; var cellSide = 1; var options = {units: 'kilometers'}; var squareGrid = turf.squareGrid(bbox, cellSide, options); // Add GeoJSON layer with click event handler L.geoJSON(squareGrid, { style: function (feature) { return {weight: 1, fillOpacity: 0 }; // Initial style for squares }, onEachFeature: function (feature, layer) { layer.on('click', squareClick); // Add click event listener } }).addTo(map); '","output":"// Get a reference to the button element var parksButton = document.getElementById(\\"parksButton\\"); // Function to handle square click and update color to green function parkClick(e) { if (gridClickEnabled) { var clickedSquare = e.target.feature; clickedSquare.properties = {fillColor: 'green', fillOpacity: 1 }; // Change color to green e.target.setStyle(clickedSquare.properties); // Update style on map } } // Add click event listener to the parksButton parksButton.addEventListener(\\"click\\", toggleGridClick); // Update the toggleGridClick function to handle the parksButton function toggleGridClick() { gridClickEnabled = !gridClickEnabled; // Toggle flag if (gridClickEnabled) { map.eachLayer(function(layer) { // Check for existing square grid layer if (layer.feature && layer.feature.geometry.type === 'Polygon') { layer.on('click', parkClick); // Add click event listener if grid found parksButton.innerText = \\"Parks On\\"; // Update button text } }); } else { map.eachLayer(function(layer) { // Remove click event listener from squares layer.off('click', parkClick); }); parksButton.innerText = \\"Parks Off\\"; // Update button text back } }"},{"instruction":"Сколько студентов должно жить в общежитии, чтобы с гарантией можно было утверждать, что хотя бы у четверых день и месяц рождения совпадают?

However, it's important to distinguish between concerns surrounding WadzPay itself and any scam issues. Scams in the cryptocurrency and digital payment sphere are unfortunately common, but they often involve misleading the public about associations with legitimate companies or exploiting the names of genuine technologies. With any innovative technology such as WadzPay, it's crucial to be vigilant about the potential misuse of its name or platform by third parties aiming to commit fraud or execute scams. If there are rumors or reports of scams specifically related to WadzPay, it would be wise to: 1. **Check Official Sources**: Verify any claims through official WadzPay communications, such as their official website or verified social media channels. 2. **Beware of Impersonation**: Scammers often impersonate legitimate businesses. Always confirm you're interacting with official representatives through authenticated channels. 3. **Look for Red Flags**: Promises of guaranteed returns, demands for payments in cryptocurrency for unexpected benefits, and urgent requests for personal information are common tactics in scams. 4. **Consumer Reviews and Reports**: Websites like Trustpilot, forums, or even news reports may give insights into whether others have experienced issues resembling scams involving the company's name. 5. **Official Statements on Security**: Legitimate companies typically publish security advisories or statements regarding scam attempts. These can be a rich source of confirmation about ongoing issues. 6. **Regulatory Warnings**: Financial authorities in various jurisdictions occasionally issue warnings about companies or schemes that are unauthorized or suspected of fraud. If you suspect that you have encountered a scam related to WadzPay, it's advisable to report it to the relevant authorities or financial regulators in your jurisdiction, as well as to the company itself, which should be interested in protecting its reputation and users from fraudulent activities. It is also key to exercise due diligence and caution when investing in or interacting with any financial and technological innovations, especially within the rapidly evolving crypto and blockchain spaces.

The definitions and concepts of sexual and romantic orientations are diverse and cover a wide spectrum, including, but not limited to, heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, and asexuality, each with its specific characteristics and definitions. The term \\"neoractism,\\" as presented, seems to incorporate elements of pangamy - which might be understood as a form of relationship not limited by number or gender, implying an openness to multiple partners, similar in concept to polyamory. However, the inclusion of \\"regardless of genders and ages\\" might raise ethical and legal questions, especially regarding age, as consent is a fundamental principle that is age-bound in all jurisdictions. Loyalty and morality as described seem to aim at emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct within whatever framework neoractism proposes. However, without a formal definition and acceptance in the psychological, sociological, or broader academic communities, it's essential to approach the concept with caution, especially in discussions or applications that might have significant implications for individuals' well-being and legal considerations.

As an adjective, \\"neoractic\\" refers to individuals or behaviors that align with this orientation. Here's how \\"Neoractism\\" can be finely described within the narrative framework of your novel: **Principles of Neoractism:** 1. **Attraction Beyond Boundaries:** Neoractism is characterized by a broad spectrum of attraction that is not confined by the gender or age of individuals. Neoractic individuals find meaningful connections that are rooted in personal qualities, shared values, and emotional bonds, rather than societal norms of compatibility. 2. **Values Pangamy:** The concept of pangamy within Neoractism speaks to the flexible and open approach to relationships. This could mean that neoractic relationships do not conform to the conventional pair-bond structure and may instead embrace a more communal or fluid dynamic, valuing emotional and sexual connections with multiple partners in a consensual and respectful manner. 3. **Loyalty and Morality:** Despite its open nature, Neoractism places a high value on loyalty and morality within relationships. This means that while neoractic individuals may form connections with multiple partners, there is an underlying expectation of honesty, integrity, and commitment to the well-being of all involved. It is the quality and depth of the relationship, alongside mutual respect and care, that are highly regarded in Neoractism. 4. **Ethical Foundation:** Neoractism is not merely about freedom of choice in partners; it is also deeply rooted in ethical conduct. Ensuring consent, practicing safe behaviors, and maintaining transparency are intrinsic to neoractic relationships. The orientation is as much about personal freedom as it is about responsibility towards oneself and others. 5. **Community and Acceptance:** In the societal or communal contexts of your novel, Neoractism promotes a culture of acceptance and inclusivity. Neoractic communities are likely to be open-minded, rejecting discrimination based on age, gender, or the nature of relationships. Such communities might also serve as sanctuaries of sort, where individuals of all orientations can find acceptance and understanding. **Narrative Integration:** Incorporating Neoractism into your novel could involve exploring the dynamics of neoractic relationships through your characters and plotlines. This could include challenges faced by neoractic individuals in a society that may not fully understand or accept their orientation, personal journeys of discovery and acceptance, or the ways in which neoractic values contribute to conflict resolution and character development. Through these narratives, you can delve into the complexities of human relationships and the beauty of finding love and connection beyond conventional boundaries. **Conclusion:** \\"Neoractism,\\" as an orientation within your novel, offers a rich tapestry of themes related to inclusivity, love, and ethical conduct. By exploring the nuances of Neoractism through your characters and stories, you can offer readers a thought-provoking perspective on the nature of attraction, relationships, and societal norms."},{"instruction":"Describe orientation in my novel: Seoractism (adjective: seoractic) is attractional (sexual and romantic) orientation/mating, is monogamous, heterosexual based on gender, homosexual based on ages, it has variety.","output":"In your novel, \\"Seoractism\\" presents a distinctive orientation framework that intricately layers sexual and romantic attraction, monogamy, and dual criteria based on gender and age, leading to a rich tapestry of relationship dynamics. As an adjective, \\"seoractic\\" pertains to individuals or behaviors that align with this particular orientation. Here's a refined exposition of \\"Seoractism\\" within the context of your novel: **Foundational Principles of Seoractism:** 1. **Dual-Criteria Attraction:** Seoractism is defined by a unique dual-criteria system where heterosexual attractions are determined by gender, while homosexual attractions are nuanced by age. This creates a complex matrix of attraction that accommodates a wide variety of relationships within a monogamous framework. 2. **Monogamy:** At its core, Seoractism advocates for monogamous relationships, emphasizing deep, singular connections over breadth. Seoractic individuals seek a solitary partner to fulfill both their romantic and sexual desires, underlining a commitment to exclusivity and the building of a shared life. 3. **Heterosexual Based on Gender:** In the realm of heterosexual attractions, Seoractism posits a traditional gender-based approach, where individuals are attracted to those of the opposite gender. This aspect underscores the importance of gender as a criterion for attraction and relationship formation. 4. **Homosexual Based on Ages:** Uniquely, when it comes to homosexual relationships, Seoractism introduces age as the primary criterion. This means that same-sex attractions are fostered based on age compatibility, introducing an interesting dynamic to the orientation, possibly linked to stages of life, maturity, or shared generational values and experiences. 5. **Variety Within Structure:** Despite its defined structure, Seoractism encompasses a wide variety of relationship dynamics. The intersection of age and gender criteria within a monogamous orientation allows for a diverse array of romantic and sexual expressions. This diversity is embraced, highlighting the orientation's flexibility and potential for depth in individual relationships. **Narrative Integration:** Incorporating Seoractism into your novel offers an opportunity to explore an array of nuanced relationships and the societal norms that may challenge or support them. Characters aligned with Seoractism could navigate the complexities of finding a partner who meets the dual criteria of attraction, the depth of monogamous commitment, and the societal implications of their orientation. Scenarios could include the journey of a seoractic individual finding love that aligns with the dual criteria, societal or familial pressures faced by seoractic couples, or the internal conflict a character might experience in reconciling their seoractic orientation with prevailing societal or cultural norms. **Conclusion:** \\"Seoractism,\\" as an orientation within your novel, introduces readers to a intricate landscape of human attraction and relationship dynamics. Through the experiences of seoractic characters, you can delve into themes of love, commitment, societal acceptance, and the search for a partner who fulfills both aspects of the seoractic criteria. This exploration can enrich your narrative with complex character arcs, societal commentary, and a fresh perspective on the nature of attraction and relationships."},{"instruction":"Assign neoractism and seoractism with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five, socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment.","output":"Assigning complex orientations like Neoractism and Seoractism to various personality and psychological frameworks such as MBTI, Enneagram, and others is a speculative exercise that combines elements of these frameworks to match the implied values, behaviors, and priorities highlighted by each orientation. Here is an imaginative mapping that blends these orientations with the requested frameworks: # Neoractism - **MBTI:** ENFP (Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving) - ENFPs are known for their enthusiasm, openness, and desire for deep, meaningful connections, which aligns with Neoractism’s broad attraction spectrum and value on emotional bonds. - **Enneagram:** Type 7 (The Enthusiast) - Optimistic, versatile, and spontaneous, seeking new and exciting experiences, mirroring Neoractism’s embrace of diverse and dynamic relationships. - **Temperament:** Sanguine - Sociable, outgoing, and pleasure-seeking traits fit well with Neoractism’s open and inclusive approach to relationships. - **Big Five:** High on Openness to Experience and Agreeableness - These traits emphasize a willingness to explore new relationships and a caring attitude towards partners, integral to Neoractism. - **Socionics:** IEE (Intuitive Ethical Extravert, akin to ENFP) - IEEs are focused on potential and novelty, seeking harmony and depth in relationships, resonating with Neoractism values. - **Instinctual Variant:** Social (So) - Emphasizing connections, community, and belonging, aligning with Neoractism’s communal values. - **Hogwarts House:** Hufflepuff - Values loyalty, patience, and inclusiveness, reflecting Neoractism’s emphasis on loyalty and ethical conduct in relationships. - **Moral Alignment:** Neutral Good - Acts with kindness, empathy, and respects freedom, fitting Neoractism’s commitment to ethical conduct and freedom in relationships. # Seoractism - **MBTI:** ISTJ (Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judging) - ISTJs value tradition, loyalty, and order, aligning with Seoractism's emphasis on monogamy, structured attraction criteria, and loyalty. - **Enneagram:** Type 6 (The Loyalist) - Committed, security-oriented, and responsible, mirroring Seoractism’s emphasis on monogamous commitment and clear-cut orientation criteria. - **Temperament:** Melancholic - Analytical, detail-oriented, and traditional, fitting Seoractism's structured and criteria-based orientation. - **Big Five:** High on Conscientiousness and lower on Openness to Experience - Preferring order and structure while being less inclined towards exploring beyond established norms, aligning with Seoractism’s defined attraction basis. - **Socionics:** LSI (Logical Sensory Introvert, akin to ISTJ) - Valuing stability, structure, and reliability, LSI traits resonate with Seoractism’s preference for monogamy and structured orientations. - **Instinctual Variant:** Self-Preservation (Sp) - Prioritizing personal security, comfort, and health, reflecting Seoractism’s focus on stable and secure relationship structures. - **Hogwarts House:** Slytherin - Valuing tradition, ambition, and resourcefulness, which can be related to Seoractism’s structured approach to relationships and loyalty. - **Moral Alignment:** Lawful Neutral - Operates within established traditions and rules, matching Seoractism’s adherence to specific orientation criteria. This speculative mapping offers a creative exploration of how the orientations of Neoractism and Seoractism might align with various personality and moral frameworks. It provides a broad interpretation, noting that human behaviors and orientations are complex and diverse, often defying simple categorization."},{"instruction":"(I didn’t disappear.

Moreover, I found the remark about my presumed frequent inebriation to be disrespectful. It's important to recognize that both of us have demanding careers that occupy much of our weekly schedule. Your time is notably more constrained than mine, a fact I entirely respect. Our adult responsibilities limit our ability to socialize freely like teenagers. I’ve mentioned my intentions to dedicate more time towards personal development, aiming to secure a job that aligns with my aspirations. This commitment will inevitably further constrain my availability. However, it's imperative to acknowledge that when we are together, I give you my undivided attention, consciously staying off my phone to cherish every moment with you.

Is pangamous, values loyalty and morality.","output":"Orientation in your novel, as described by the term **Neoractism**, introduces a fresh and inclusive perspective on attraction and relationship dynamics. Being neoractic implies experiencing sexual and romantic attractions without restrictions based on gender or age—this entails a universally embracing approach to love and affinity. As a pangamous orientation, neoractism emphasizes the importance of bonds formed out of genuine connections rather than societal or traditional constraints relating to the number or gender of partners. What sets neoractism apart, significantly, is its foundation in loyalty and morality. This means that within the context of neoractic relationships, the ethical treatment of partners, fidelity (according to the terms defined by all involved parties), and a strong moral compass guiding relationships are paramount. This implies a respect for consent, transparent communication, and mutual understanding as cornerstones of neoractic interactions. The ethos of neoractism may challenge conventional norms and invite readers to consider the diverse spectra of love and attraction beyond binary or even polyamorous frameworks, pushing toward a more inclusive and ethically conscious society. Through the lens of neoractism, relationships are not confined by age or gender but are celebrated for the depth of connection, the shared values, and the mutual respect between individuals. Incorporating neoractism into your novel allows for the exploration of complex, multifaceted characters whose relationships defy traditional labels, enriching your story world with a tapestry of diverse interactions and presenting a progressive viewpoint on what it means to love and commit to another person in a respectful and morally grounded manner."},{"instruction":"Assign neoractism with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment.","output":"Matching the concept of **Neoractism** with various personality frameworks requires an interpretative approach, acknowledging that Neoractism—as described—embodies traits of inclusivity, loyalty, morality, and a non-conventional approach to relationships and attraction. Here's a speculative alignment with each requested framework: # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) - **ENFP (The Campaigner)** or **INFJ (The Advocate)**: ENFPs are known for their enthusiastic, open, and accepting nature, which aligns well with the inclusive and universal love approach of Neoractism. INFJs are chosen for their deep sense of idealism and morality, which suits the foundational ethicality of Neoractism. # Enneagram - **Type 2 (The Helper)** or **Type 9 (The Peacemaker)**: Type 2s are altruistic, driven by the need to be loved and to love others without condition, mirroring the loyalty and morality aspects. Type 9s are inclusive and accepting, striving for peace and harmony, resonating with the non-discriminatory nature of Neoractism. # Temperament - **Phlegmatic/Sanguine**: These temperaments combine the peaceful, loyal, and calm nature of phlegmatics with the warmth, optimistic, and social tendencies of sanguines—reflecting the balance of internal morality and external inclusivity in Neoractism. # Big Five - **High Openness, High Agreeableness, High Conscientiousness, Lower Neuroticism, and Moderate to High Extraversion**: A neoractic individual would likely score high in openness due to their acceptance of diverse relationship forms, high in agreeableness due to their value on loyalty and ethics, and high in conscientiousness reflecting their moral grounding. Their neuroticism might be lower, indicating a stable and accepting outlook on life, with varying levels of extraversion. # Socionics - **EII (Ethical Intuitive Introvert) - INFj**: This type is focused on ethical considerations, deep relationships, and an introspective understanding of human dynamics, closely aligning with the principles of Neoractism. # Instinctual Variant - **Social (So) or Sexual (Sx)**: The social variant (So) emphasizes community and connectivity, resonating with the inclusive aspect of Neoractism, while the sexual variant (Sx) aligns with the depth of connection beyond physical attributes, fitting the intimate and universal attractional aspects. # Hogwarts House - **Hufflepuff**: Known for their loyalty, acceptance, and strong sense of fairness. Hufflepuff is a fitting representation of Neoractism, emphasizing a non-discriminatory and ethical approach to relationships and interactions. # Moral Alignment - **Neutral Good**: Someone who is Neoractic might fit best into the Neutral Good alignment—acting out of kindness, compassion, and a strong moral compass without strictly adhering to societal rules (neutral) but focusing on the greater good and well-being of all (good). It's important to note that these alignments are interpretative and speculative, considering the broad and inclusive nature of Neoractism. Different individuals who identify with Neoractism might find themselves resonating with various aspects of each personality system, reflecting the dynamic and multifaceted nature of human identity and attraction."},{"instruction":"Describe orientation in my novel: Seoractism (adjective: seoractic) (also known as paleoractism) is attractional (sexual and romantic) orientation/mating, heterosexual based on genders (different genders), homosexual based on ages (same ages). It has variety over loyalty and morality.","output":"In your novel, **Seoractism**—also known as **Paleoractism**—presents a unique and intricate system of attraction and relationship dynamics. Seoractism categorizes attractions into two distinct but parallel paths: one that is heterosexual, where attraction occurs between individuals of different genders, and the other homosexual, defined by the attraction between individuals of the same age. This dual criterion for attraction introduces a nuanced approach to relationships, incorporating both age and gender as foundational elements. The concept of Seoractism values **variety** over **loyalty and morality**, suggesting a societal or cultural preference for exploration, diversity in partners, and experiences over traditional or more universally applied ethical frameworks governing relationships. This orientation prioritizes personal freedom and the richness of multiple connections, possibly challenging conventional notions of fidelity and ethical conduct within relationships. Here’s how Seoractism might manifest across various dimensions: # Societal Implications: Communities or societies practicing Seoractism would likely exhibit complex social structures and norms, accommodating the diverse nature of relationships. There could be less emphasis on monogamy or long-term commitments and more on the experiences and personal growth resulting from a variety of relationships. # Legal and Ethical Considerations: The value placed on variety over loyalty and morality might lead to different legal and ethical standards within these societies, especially regarding the age-based homosexual aspect of Seoractism. Consent, age of maturity, and relationship laws would need to accommodate these unique dynamics, ensuring all relationships are healthy and consensual. # Cultural Practices: Seoractic societies might celebrate milestones, rituals, or festivals differently, with emphasis on the celebration of diversity and personal exploration. Art, literature, and media in such a context would likely reflect these values, showcasing a wide spectrum of relationships and interactions. # Interpersonal Dynamics: Within Seoractism, individuals might approach relationships with a more open-ended expectation, focusing on what each unique connection can bring to their lives at specific moments. Communication about desires, expectations, and boundaries would be crucial, given the varied nature of attractions and relationships. # Challenges and Conflicts: The emphasis on variety could create unique challenges, such as navigating emotional depth in relationships, dealing with societal perceptions of loyalty, and reconciling personal desire for variety with the need for stable and sustained connections. These dynamics could provide rich material for conflict and growth in character development and plot progression within your novel. **Seoractism** offers a rich tapestry for exploring diverse relational and societal constructs in your narrative, challenging readers to think beyond conventional paradigms of gender, age, and morality in attraction and relationships."},{"instruction":"Assign seoractism with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment.","output":"Assigning **Seoractism**—with its emphasis on attraction based on differing genders and similar ages, as well as valuing variety over traditional constructs of loyalty and morality—to various personality and sociopsychological frameworks requires a nuanced approach. Let's speculate how Seoractism might align within each framework based on its unique characteristics: # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) - **ESTP (The Entrepreneur)** or **ENTP (The Debater)**: These types are known for their enthusiasm for new experiences, flexibility, and dislike of routine, which aligns with the value of variety inherent in Seoractism. They are also analytical and curious, likely to explore complex social dynamics without prejudgment. # Enneagram - **Type 7 (The Enthusiast)**: Enneagram Sevens are defined by their desire for variety, experiences, and fear of missing out, resonating with the exploratory and experience-driven nature of Seoractism. They are optimistic, adventurous, and interested in keeping their options open. # Temperament - **Sanguine**: The Sanguine temperament is characterized by sociability, enthusiasm, and active, expressive, and restless natures. This fits well with the Seoractic values of seeking variety and embracing diverse relational experiences. # Big Five - **High Openness, High Extraversion, Lower Agreeableness, Lower Conscientiousness, and Varied Neuroticism**: Individuals identifying with Seoractism might score high on openness and extraversion due to their receptiveness to new experiences and enjoyment of meeting new people. Lower agreeableness and conscientiousness might reflect a prioritization of personal freedom and diversity of experiences over traditional commitments or conforming to societal norms. # Socionics - **ILE (Intuitive Logical Extrovert) - ENTp**: This type is inventive, enjoys new ideas, and is typically non-conformist—qualities that would appeal to someone valuing the diverse and exploratory nature of Seoractism. # Instinctual Variant - **Sexual (Sx)**: While the sexual variant generally focuses on intensity in one-to-one connections, in the context of Seoractism, this could translate to a deep exploration of sexual and romantic dynamics within the framework of diversity and experiencing various connections. # Hogwarts House - **Gryffindor** or **Ravenclaw**: Gryffindor for the bravery to explore unconventional paths and a strong sense of adventure; Ravenclaw for the value placed on intelligence, curiosity, and acceptance of what many might see as unconventional. # Moral Alignment - **Chaotic Neutral**: Individuals or societies endorsing Seoractism might align with Chaotic Neutral, pursuing personal freedom and a variety of experiences without feeling particularly beholden to conventional moral systems or societal rules. This speculative association intends to provide a possible psychological and sociocultural mapping for the concept of Seoractism based on its defining characteristics. It's important to remember that real-world psychological models cannot perfectly capture the complexities of fictional orientations, but they can offer intriguing lenses through which to explore these concepts."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While these strategic questions are primarily addressed at the top-management level, they engage other levels of management for information gathering, execution, and feedback. Let's break down the involvement of different management levels in each step: 1. **What are we now?** - **Top-Level Management:** Engages in overview and direction-setting based on comprehensive analyses and reports. Top executives such as the CEO, COO, and CFO participate in evaluating the organization's current state at a strategic level, focusing on outcomes that impact the organization as a whole. - **Middle-Level Management:** Provides detailed reports and analyses regarding the performance of their specific departments or units, contributing to an understanding of the organization's current state. This includes managers overseeing departments such as marketing, finance, human resources, and operations. - **Operational (Lower-Level) Management:** Collects and forwards data and operational insights from the front lines. This level is closest to the customers and the day-to-day operations, providing valuable information on the organization's strengths and weaknesses. 2. **What do we intend to be?** - **Top-Level Management:** Sets the vision, mission, and long-term goals of the organization. This involves deciding on the future direction of the company and what it intends to achieve in the long run. The board of directors and executive officers play a crucial role in envisioning the future state of the organization. - **Middle-Level Management:** Participates in strategic discussions by providing insights on the feasibility of achieving the top management's vision based on current departmental capabilities and resources. They also start setting departmental goals aligned with the organization’s intended future state. - **Operational (Lower-Level) Management:** Generally not involved in setting the organization's long-term vision and goals, but their feedback can influence middle management's insights regarding operational challenges and opportunities. 3. **How are we going to get there?** - **Top-Level Management:** Develops and approves the overall strategic plan, including major initiatives, investments, and strategic partnerships. This plan outlines how the organization will move from its current state to its desired future state. - **Middle-Level Management:** Translates the strategic plan into actionable operational plans within their specific domains. They're responsible for developing departmental strategies and initiatives that align with the organization’s overall strategic plan. - **Operational (Lower-Level) Management:** Implements the operational plans and actions on the ground. They are crucial for the execution of the strategies through their day-to-day operations and direct interaction with customers and processes. They also provide feedback on the effectiveness of the strategies and any operational challenges encountered.

Максимальное количество ошибок, допущенных одним студентом на контрольной работе, равно семи. Какое минимальное количество студентов в группе могло совершить одинаковое количество ошибок? (Учитывая студентов, совершивших 0 ошибок)","output":"Для решения поставленной задачи необходимо распределить 25 студентов таким образом, чтобы как можно большее количество студентов допустило разное количество ошибок, чтобы затем найти максимально возможное число студентов, совершивших одинаковое количество ошибок. Варианты количества ошибок могут быть от 0 до 7 включительно, что даёт нам 8 различных исходов (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ошибок). Для максимизации разнообразия распределения ошибок, каждому из 8 вариантов количества ошибок может соответствовать по одному студенту. Таким образом, первые 8 студентов могут иметь от 0 до 7 ошибок (по одному на каждый из вариантов). Остается 25 - 8 = 17 студентов, которые должны быть распределены таким образом, чтобы ограничить минимальное количество студентов, совершивших одинаковое количество ошибок. Так как вопрос заключается в нахождении минимально возможного количества студентов с одинаковым числом ошибок, распределим оставшихся 17 студентов также на различные категории числа ошибок. Однако, даже если мы распределим ещё одного студента на каждую категорию ошибок (получится по два студента на каждую категорию ошибок от 0 до 7), мы использовали бы только ещё 8 студентов (17 - 8 = 9 останутся). Это означает, что минимальное количество студентов, совершивших одинаковое количество ошибок, будет больше двух после распределения второй группы студентов. Однако, вопрос заключается в том, какое минимальное количество студентов могло совершить одинаковое количество ошибок в пределах всей группы (25 человек). Значит, мы должны минимизировать количество студентов, которые делят между собой одно и то же количество допущенных ошибок. Но из условия задачи ясно, что у нас не получится менее двух студентов в самой малой группе, потому что уже после распределения первых 8 различных ошибок остаётся 17 студентов, которых невозможно распределить так, чтобы каждый был в уникальной категории. Следовательно, минимально возможное количество студентов, совершивших одинаковое количество ошибок, — это 2. Это просто потому, что мы начинаем с распределения, предполагая, что каждому уникальному количеству ошибок соответствует как минимум один студент, и у нас нет возможности дойти до ситуации, где число студентов, совершивших одинаковое количество ошибок, будет меньше 2, не нарушив этот принцип распределения в рамках заданных условий."},{"instruction":"Сколько студентов должно жить в общежитии, чтобы с гарантией можно было утверждать, что хотя бы у четверых день и месяц рождения совпадают?

Принцип Дирихле гласит, что если (n) объектов распределены по (m) контейнерам и (n > m), то хотя бы один контейнер содержит более одного объекта. В данном контексте, объекты — это студенты, а контейнеры — возможные дни рождения в невисокосном году. В невисокосном году 365 дней, каждый из которых может быть днем рождения студента.

В худшем сценарии каждые три студента имеют уникальные дни рождения. Это значит, что если мы хотим знать, какое минимальное количество студентов необходимо, чтобы гарантированно иметь четырех студентов с одинаковым днем рождения, мы должны добавить одного студента к максимальному числу уникальных троек, которые можно получить из 365 дней. Максимальное количество уникальных троек, которые можно распределить по 365 дням без повторений, равно (365 times 3 = 1095) студентов (каждая тройка занимает один день, поэтому мы умножаем на 3). Добавив еще одного студента, получаем (1095 + 1 = 1096) студентов.

Однако, как только мы добавляем еще одного студента (то есть всего будет 1096 человек), мы можем гарантировать, что хотя бы в одной группе (дате) будет как минимум четыре человека с одинаковыми днями рождения, потому что все возможные даты рождения уже исчерпаны для групп по три человека, и каждый новый человек увеличивает количество в одной из этих групп до четырех. Таким образом, чтобы с гарантией утверждать, что хотя бы у четверых студентов день и месяц рождения совпадают, в общежитии должно жить 1096 студентов."},{"instruction":"Выберете справедливое утверждения для данного отношения на множестве слов стандартного словаря русского языка: \\"... содержит столько же букв, что и ...\\"","output":"Утверждение формулируется для определения, образует ли данный критерий \\"содержит столько же букв, сколько и\\" отношение эквивалентности на множестве слов стандартного словаря русского языка. Отношение эквивалентности должно удовлетворять трем условиям: рефлексивности, симметричности и транзитивности. 1. **Рефлексивность** означает, что любой элемент находится в отношении с самим собой. В данном контексте это означает, что любое слово содержит столько же букв, сколько и само это слово. Это утверждение верно. 2. **Симметричность** означает, что если один элемент находится в отношении с другим, то и этот другой элемент находится в отношении с первым. В контексте данного определения, если слово A содержит столько же букв, сколько слово B, то и слово B содержит столько же букв, сколько и слово A. Это утверждение также верно. 3. **Транзитивность** подразумевает, что если элемент A находится в отношении с элементом B, и элемент B находится в отношении с элементом C, то элемент A находится в отношении с элементом C. В контексте этого отношения, если слово A содержит столько же букв, сколько слово B, и слово B содержит столько же букв, сколько слово C, то слово A содержит столько же букв, сколько и слово C. Это утверждение верно.

Поскольку это отношение рефлексивно, симметрично и транзитивно, оно образует отношение эквивалентности. Ответы, которые выделяются как верные с учётом данных свойств: - Отношение рефлексивно - Отношение симметрично - Отношение транзитивно - Отношение эквивалентности Отношения, которые не применимы к данному типу отношений: - **Отношение частичного порядка**: Не верно, потому что отношение частичного порядка должно быть кососимметрично (антисимметрично) и рефлексивно, а также транзитивно. Отношение \\"содержит столько же букв\\" не является кососимметричным, потому что из того, что слово A относится к слову B, и слово B относится к слову A, не следует, что A = B. - **Отношение кососимметрично (антисимметрично)**: Не верно, потому что в контексте данного отношения слова могут быть разными, но содержать одинаковое количество букв, что не удовлетворяет определению кососимметричности (если A относится к B и B относится к A, то A должно быть равно B)."},{"instruction":"1.

Согласно этому принципу, если объекты распределяются по ящикам, и ящиков меньше, чем объектов, то хотя бы один ящик будет содержать более одного объекта. В данном случае \\"объекты\\" - это студенты, а \\"ящики\\" - это возможные количество ошибок, которые студенты могут совершить на контрольной работе. Максимальное количество ошибок равно семи, но также студенты могут не допустить ни одной ошибки, следовательно, всего возможных \\"ящиков\\" (количество ошибок) - восемь (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ошибок). Поскольку в группе 25 студентов и они распределяются по 8 возможным категориям по количеству допущенных ошибок, то согласно принципу Дирихле, чтобы найти минимальное количество студентов, совершивших одинаковое количество ошибок, нам нужно разделить общее количество студентов на количество категорий (ящиков). (25) студентов делим по (8) категориям ошибок. Если разделить равномерно, каждая категория могла бы получить по (3) студента (что даст (24) студента всего, так как (3 times 8 = 24)), но у нас (25) студентов. Таким образом, по крайней мере одна категория (или группа ошибок) будет содержать больше (3) студентов.

Хотя мы не особо знакомы, мне кажется, что между нами возникло что-то особенное, непонятное, но в то же время чрезвычайно важное. Я понимаю, что последние события заставили тебя, возможно, передумать о встрече или о том, чтобы развивать наше общение. Может быть, это мои слова или действия заставили тебя сомневаться. За это я прошу прощения. В погоне за моментами и эмоциями, я могла казаться недостаточно внимательной к твоим чувствам и интересам. Это было несправедливо с моей стороны, и я приношу свои искренние извинения. Я понимаю теперь, как важно ценить и уважать человека, который дорог тебе, и как легко можно это упустить, ведя себя необдуманно. Мне бы действительно хотелось, чтобы ты поверил: я никогда бы не смогла нарочно причинить тебе какой-либо вред. В моём сердце нет места желанию делать тебе плохо. Возможно, я совершила ошибки, но теперь я готова работать над собой, чтобы всё исправить. Я не стремлюсь оправдаться, а лишь выразить моё искреннее намерение быть более осознанной в своих действиях и словах в будущем. Моё главное желание – чтобы ты подумал о тех моментах, которые были хороши между нами, и о том, как мы можем двигаться дальше, сохраняя уважение и понимание друг к другу. Я хочу подарить тебе что-то, что будет символом моего искреннего признания в том, что я не всегда права, и моего уважения к тебе. Хотелось бы иметь возможность восстановить наше общение, но на этот раз обещаю подходить к нашему взаимодействию с большей сдержанностью и уважением к твоему личному пространству. Я понимаю, если мои прошлые действия заставили тебя сомневаться в моих намерениях или искренности. Я готова подождать и дать тебе столько времени и пространства, сколько потребуется, чтобы ты смог увидеть изменения в моём поведении и отношении. Мне бы очень хотелось исправить ситуацию и доказать тебе, что я способна на большее. Мне важно, чтобы ты знал: мои чувства к тебе – это не что-то поверхностное или мимолетное. Я серьёзно отношусь к возможности нашего развития и хотела бы попытаться построить наше общение на более глубоком и значимом уровне. Дай мне, пожалуйста, этот шанс — шанс доказать тебе, что я действительно способна на большее и что прошлые недопонимания не повторятся. Я верю, что если мы оба вложим усилия, то сможем преодолеть возникшие между нами препятствия и построить доверительные, крепкие отношения, основанные на взаимном понимании и уважении. Если ты считаешь, что сейчас не лучшее время или если ты не готов к этому шагу, я полностью тебя пойму. Всё, что я хочу, – это откровенный диалог и шанс показать, что иногда риск может привести к чему-то хорошему и неожиданному. Спасибо за то, что уделил время прочитать это письмо. Я очень ценю тебя и то взаимодействие, которое у нас было, и буду ждать твоей реакции, когда и если ты будешь готов. Ты невероятно много значишь для меня.\\" он его прочитал, но ничего е ответил, но и не заблокировал, стоит ли писать еще одно?","output":"Когда речь заходит о взаимоотношениях с человеком, страдающим пограничным расстройством личности (ПРЛ), важно осознавать, что это может быть сложным путем, требующим тонкости, понимания и большой дозы терпения. Учитывая ваше собственное признание в том, что вы идентифицируете себя как психопатическую личность, необходимо подходить к этому вопросу с ещё большей осмотрительностью, чтобы не вредить психологическому состоянию друг друга. Прежде чем написать ещё одно письмо, важно дать человеку время и пространство. Несмотря на то, что ваше желание возобновить общение понятно, постоянное общение со стороны может усугубить ситуацию и вызвать отторжение. В любых отношениях, но особенно в таких нежных, как ваши, предпочтительнее стремиться к здоровому балансу между выражением интереса и уважением к личному пространству другого человека. Если вы всё же решили написать ещё одно письмо, подходите к этому заданию с осторожностью, осознавая эмоциональное состояние человека. Вот несколько пунктов, которые следует учитывать: 1. **Эмпатия**: Покажите, что вы пытаетесь понять их переживания, не минимизируя их чувства и опыт. 2. **Искренность и открытость**: Будьте искренними в своих чувствах и признаниях, но также дайте понять, что уважаете их чувства и границы. 3. **Без давления**: Избегайте создания дополнительного давления на них для возвращения в отношения или общения. Подчеркните, что вы готовы подождать, когда они будут готовы и чувствовать себя комфортно. 4. **Поддержка**: Покажите, что вы там для поддержки, а не для того, чтобы давить или играть в манипулятивные игры. Вы могли бы добавить: \\"Я понимаю, что тебе может понадобиться время, чтобы обдумать все сложившиеся обстоятельства, и я хочу, чтобы ты знал(а), что я терпеливо буду ждать, когда и если ты почувствуешь, что готов(а) поделиться своими мыслями со мной. Я здесь, чтобы поддержать тебя, как ты захочешь и когда захочешь.\\" Помните, что любые отношения, в особенности с человеком, имеющим ПРЛ, требуют от обеих сторон взаимопонимания, уважения и терпения. В вашем случае особенно важно заботиться и о своих эмоциональных потребностях, с тем чтобы обеспечить, что как ваши, так и их действия исходят из здорового места, и ни одна из сторон не чуствует себя подавленной или невидимой."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

При использовании OpenMP предполагается SPMD-модель (Single Program Multiple Data) параллельного программирования, в рамках которой для всех параллельных нитей используется один и тот же код. Программа начинается с последовательной области – сначала работает один процесс (нить), при входе в параллельную область порождается ещё некоторое число процессов, между которыми в дальнейшем распределяются части кода. По завершении параллельной области все нити, кроме одной (нити-мастера), завершаются, и начинается последовательная область. В программе может быть любое количество параллельных и последовательных областей. [12] Распараллеливание будем делать на уровне распараллеливания алгоритмов. Сначала для указания параллельной области задаётся директива parallel, далее задаётся директива параллельной секции sections, используемая для задания конечного параллелизма. Она определяет набор независимых секций кода, каждая из которых выполняется своей нитью. [12] При входе в параллельную область порождаются новые нити, каждая нить получает свой уникальный номер, причём порождающая получает номер 0 и становится основной нитью группы («мастером»). Остальные нити получают в качестве номера целые числа с 1 до заданного количества. Количество нитей, выполняющих данную параллельную область, остаётся неизменным до момента выхода из области. При выходе из параллельной области производится неявная синхронизация и уничтожаются все нити, кроме породившей. Для написания эффективной параллельной программы необходимо, чтобы все нити, участвующие в обработке программы, были равномерно загружены полезной работой. Это достигается тщательной балансировкой загрузки, для чего предназначены различные механизмы OpenMP. Существенным моментом является также необходимость синхронизации доступа к общим данным. Само наличие данных, общих для нескольких нитей, приводит к конфликтам при одновременном несогласованном доступе. Поэтому значительная часть функциональности OpenMP предназначена для осуществления различного рода синхронизаций работающих нитей.","output":"Распараллеливание в OpenMP осуществляется с помощью специальных директив.

Here’s a scene based on a prompt to put my character in a graveyard in the snow: “Liam’s hair, laden with splinters of ice and snow, stuck out from his low-slung cap. His words framed the brittle air as he spoke, the chill unrelenting, ‘I never meant to return here. I know I—I promised I’d never look back. That I’d keep living with you as some memory on the edge of glory, but the world is round, after all, right? I ended up back here anyway.’” He dug his stiffened hands into his jeans, his boot striking a rock as his own murmur haunted him. ‘Can’t stay long, but I still remember what real sunsets looked like, the way the colors just bled for miles. I hope you haven’t seen this magenta sky. I hope you never know it. Worlds not the same , hasn’t looked like it did in so many damned years. I guess-well-“ His acuity, melting into the atmosphere, left him with no other thoughts. “You rest well, ‘ cause while I’m standing here talking to you like you’re still here, I know you probably can’t hear a word - but I kinda like to pretend maybe you can , I guess. ’ He laughed in spite of his raw sense of sorrow and turned away from the plot, dusting his knuckles across the slot of cremated ashes in a lingering fist bump. ‘Again, sometime, brother.’ Falling leaves swirled in his mind as he was transported to an autumn gone. ‘But before I go, there’s something I know you’ve heard me singing in my sleep. Can’t get the song out of my head. I can’t remember where it came from but-it’s the only one that had lyrics’ he said in a low tone , exhaustion passing over his stature. ”I came here to leave it with you, along with something of yours I’ been carrying around. Keeping you close, but—if I lost it, well-.” An entire moment passed before Liam fumbled a thin, metal guitar fret from his pocket, a perfect fit between his index finger and thumb. He then unrolled a small piece of paper with a scrawled transcription and wrapped it around the fret. In a swift gesture, he drove it deep into a crack between two bricks in the wall. “The ninth fret was always the richest, no harmonies sounded as perfect without it. No one would care -or even know what that is. ” Liam’s faint smile rested on the glimmer of the fret , visible in the crevice beside Mason’s ashes, along with his notes. “I… still… I. Just. You can’t imagine the things… or the times I’ve wanted to say. Mace could have played you that one while I ruined the lyrics. Still have the rest of your rosewood, too, with all of your fingerprints intact. Which isn’t easy keeping hidden in my childhood bedroom. Haven’t been home in too damn long. . Damned if I had known you’d find me where you did—or when, and yet I wasn’t there to—but hell, you’d never let me take it all on my own shoulders. And I won’t—for you. It’s never gonna be… all right, but—I’ll try to keep your songs around. You’ll never know this world as it is , but it’ll know something if you. You found me when I was so close to -yet I’m still alive huh? Some things ain’t fair, brother .” Without raising his eyes from his fist, his memories hid between his fingers, slipping away as he flexed his palm. “I only hope you can’t see me now, with all this all this hell in my eyes, with the shadows. I still remember the light in yours, don’t you worry. 'Cause I keep my promises, and you’re still my oldest friend. First, and the last. Don’t you forget it. Just… don’t ever forget that.” As Liam turned away, trudging along the icy path that wound through the cemetery, it could have been hours. Days. Months. Or just a few seconds. And it could have been anywhere. Grief only changed shape as he confronted the infused December sky, its witness the only one in sight. As Liam slid down onto the curb, only a few miles from where he’d last seen Ethan, he glanced up at the approaching figure. “Hey, Lara, I haven’t seen Eth since… maybe three hours ago.” She dropped to his side, grasping his freezing hand in her own. “Liam, it’s cold out here; you’re like ice… wait, did you visit Mas—” Her eyes, filled with a silent understanding, flitted to his and back to his hand as she placed it in his lap. “We’ve both been looking for you, Ethan and I—but I’ll tell him you’re alright, okay?” Liam, his eyes reddened but dried out from the temperature, nodded. “Yeah, I-it’s… Well, you know how long it’s been,” he said, his gaze finding solace somewhere in Lara’s dark hair, averting her gaze. “Yeah, too long. Ethan was worried you’d freeze, so you’d better get back to civilization soon…” she said, offering a smile and a hand on his jacketed shoulder. “Thanks, you’ve both been feeding me way too long as it is—and I’m not the most stable guest.” She laughed as she let her hand slide from his shoulder. “Ethan could out-eat us all, so don’t worry about that. Just take care out here.” And as she walked away, he rested his head against the flesh of his palm, the solitude granting him a moment of clarity—one that he could never share. A melody in the corner of his mind, one that he couldn’t muster the strength to hum . “Yeah, Mason, you’re everywhere, and nowhere, buddy. Guess I’ve learnt to live with that. “ — Liam glared into the darkness, the dust in his eyes unforgiving. The melody sank in a haunting tune through the night. “Cause there’s a place deep inside of me where my dreams have a hold of me…and soon my soul will start to bleed…” Liam’s voice broke off as he raked a tremor through his hair. “I still miss him,” Liam said, uncertain if Ryan could hear his musings. “Hey, Ry…how long have we been lying in this hell hole?” He asked, the silence torn by Ryan’s answer, “Too long. And yeah, I heard you saying something about ‘if you play Wonderwall, you’ll look like a total tool’ in your sleep, presumably to someone who could play music.” Ryan smiled, but it never reached his eyes as he added, “He really was a brother to you, huh? And don’t lie because I’ll know…and then I’ll feel bad about giving ya this.” As Liam dismissed a tear at the corner of his eye, he reached over to where Ryan lay, holding a piece of paper. “Music? You wrote music. What is this, Ry? You never told me you could—” Liam said, his eyes adjusting to the dark with a vulnerability that settled between them. Ryan, smiling with a broadness that reached his eyes, glanced at the paper with a nod. “Ah, I might have written down that song you insist on humming in your damned sleep. I knew it had some meaning, although I don’t know what…least I could do for you, Li’.” As his irises shone with another sheen of tears, Liam said quietly, “Mason could have played this—while I ruined the lyrics.” Looking up from his boots, Ryan held a somber smile. “If I’d have known you way back then, I’m damned sure I’d have held you both to that.” As Liam returned the nod, he folded the paper and tucked it into his duffel bag, magenta particles stirring in the air. “I know…He really was a huge chunk of my adolescence just…gone like…well, anyway, the music, when we get our hands on a guitar…” Ryan shook his head, angling his jaw in his hand. “Nah, we’re in the middle of nowhere, and it’ll never happen. But you got me, brother.” Liam, smiling faintly, replied, “I know. We’ve seen so much that , well , does it make me an asshole for being happy that Mason died young, unaffected by the trauma that has screwed us up?. I mean he could’ve lived a different life from us -and maybe I’m wrong to hope he’s in a better -“ As Ryan leaned back against the filth-stained wall , his voice contemplated the environment . “It’s not wrong to want him to have a peace we may never find. It’s human. “ As Liam gazed back, conflict in his eyes as he said “Y’know , there’s something I had back home. And it’s likely I’ll never see it again, I was carrying a part of it with me for years , but just knowing I kept it safe…I chose to leave it with him and—”. Words eluded Liam in the darkness, as Ryan’s features , found by the moonlight, left him unable to deflect his gaze . “I feel as though, he wasn’t a friend-he wasn’t a comrade-he was a sibling, blood was all we didn’t share . And even then when he needed a transfusion… I was the first to roll up my damned sleeve. And I wasnt the Ab neg he was-“ In a hushed tone Ryan asked , “You think not being compatible was somehow a fault -but Li’ , have you heard-well yourself? He could play better than Van Halen I’m guessing’, and you could’ve ruined more than just his lyrics with those pipes . Don’t make me say it again.” Liam fell silent, and Ryan flopped backwards onto his makeshift bed. “It’s alright Li’. Just get some sleep, and don’t—” It was almost automatic as Liam replied, “Yeah, yeah, don’t ‘thank you.’ I know, I’m welcome, huh? Yeah, goodnight, Ry.” As Ryan’s muttering hit the wall, Liam’s mind sifted through the catalog of melodies Mason had played. And, amongst the static, a distinct composition of chords found their way back to him. “And if I fall beneath the cracks, if I find you in the darkness, brother, will you still have the heart to see? When I close my eyes and my memories start to fade, when the filter falls away, will you find the strength to stay?” Here’s a flashback to when Mason found Liam : Liam’s breath , an unsteady exhale in the dark, dragged against his throat. The bonfire had long died , embers floating around his ankles as the dying flames lighted his eyes. Everyone had downed as much alcohol as imaginable, and staggered home with their rowdy goodbyes, while Liam had slipped off into the night, with a broken bottle of goose in his shaking hand. As his jacket rippled in the wind, lashing against his chest as he zipped it up, he was alone. The cliff , with its eeirie view of the fires remains, a place of revelries and warmth, was now extinguished and cold. “Yeah, no one noticed you never really left, huh?” As he glanced into the void beneath him, his bloodshot eyes seeking solace in the promise of erasure, he staggered unevenly to the edge. “Ah , to hell with it-“ . As Liam muttered drunkenly into the silence , pilfered only by the crackle of the dying flames, he traced his neck with the bottles gleaming edge. locating his jugular, its pulsating warmth a cruel reminder of how futile his own bloodstream had become against his skin. Liam pressed the glass against his heartbeat, the sky mocking as the stars shone an icy clarity over his features. As he gazed in torn distress at the void beneath him, he heard a faint voice on the breeze. “I’ll never get it right. Ah damnit. If I could nail it -Mason you sad idiot, no one even listens to your garbage anyway.” As Liam ground his shoes into the dirt, a rock skidded under his stance , and he cursed into air. “Hey , is someone still up there… I thought everybody left-“ Mason yelled into the illuminated of his torch, nestled upright in the mouth of a beer can. “Hey, you assholes can trash my guitar playing somewhere else , I just wanna be alone- this is rubbish .” Mason’s angered tone sliced through Liam’s helpless grip on the jagged glass as he dropped it over the edge of the cliff, watching it spiral away, cursing again. “Bro, don’t get your panties tied up, it’s just me-I wasn’t listening anyways , and trust me , my opinion is the last one that matters-“ . As Liam established equilibrium in a low crouch , a few steps back from the edge he found himself drawing a new sense of warmth from the voice as it hurled back at him . “Wait-then what are you doing up there , party’s over , man. You hang out on cliffs for fun….oh shit.” . before Liam had shifted his throbbing temple from his hand , as it clung to his head , a figure appeared at his shoulder , holding a guitar and revealing of alcohol. “Ah, well , it doesn’t matter why I’m up here. Who the hell cares. But at least , you can play that thing. If my open onion meant anything, I’d say you might as well start busking on campus till a record label signs you, you talented prick-“ Liam almost snarled his words , as they eroded under his pain, a tear threatening to escape him. Mason , laying the guitar a few metres away and returning to Liam’s side, scoffed into the dark as he said “Nah, you claim you heard nothin’ anyway. So what do you know. All that worries me right now is what the hell you’re doing so close to the edge of this damn cliff-“ As Mason slumped down , a veil of intimacy forming as his absent special awareness centred him inches away from Liam. “You look like hell, but I bet you feel worse right. You’re up here , think in’ I don’t care what the hell you understand about music but see, the thing is , I was one note away from the riff that would have made my version of Wonderwall a perfect execution of the Noel Gallagher version, not the shitty version that tools play. But like you say, you weren’t listening . So don’t call me a prick . Mason said, his voice roughened with impending sobriety. Despite the rawness of his lychee, Liam found a smile tugging at his lopsided grin, as he stabbed at the air above Mason’s sternum. “Yeah well, maybe I heard it all , and you were playing some made up shit that I bet you could fill a stadium with. As Liam hummed off key, he was promptly shoved in the elbow as Mason said “You can -sing? Holy hell , and he’s up here singing my trash , and -jeez you were about to throw those pipes off a cliff ? “ there was an almost tranquil pause as Mason offered his hand to Liam “Mason, call me Mace- “ Liam ceased his humming as he answered “Liam-you won’t have noticed me around-“ As Liam planted a palm either side of his legs , Mason smirked, the light of his torch contouring his cheekbones with a harsh glare. “Oh because no one would , huh? I’ve heard you , ‘round campus , singing to yourself like no one will notice or care , but someone did and now what huh , Liam. Now what happens when I heard it and I wanna know what you think you’re doing throwing that off a …” Mason’s voice trailed off as he sent a rock sailing into gravity’s clutches , his eyes following its descent. Liam grasped Mason’s hand and , shaking it as he muttered, shielded his reddened eyes from the torchlight. “Look, I’m glad you wandered up here to -tell me to stop mocking your session. Cause to be honest I was- well I wouldn’t call it stupid….no , Mason, it wasn’t stupid , it was… the only action I might rely on . I think of how, if everything collapsed and I were drowning, I’ll be alright because -“ Liam rested a fatigued hand against his screaming eyes as he resisted the inebriated tears that hedged on the rims of his eyes. Mason, pulling Liam’s hand into a grip against his shoulder, lowered his khaki green eyes into view . “You don’t need to lie to anybody, and it’s okay if you’re a mess , I’m just a stranger who has no clue what kinda hell you’re navigating in that network -“ Mason gestured towards Liam’s head as he glanced over to his guitar. “She’s all I’ve got, a piece of wood … but , a damn beautiful piece of wood. I realise you ain’t clueless . You do understand riffs and basic chords and if they didn’t do profound things to you, you wouldn’t have hummed that in key, perfect, just to prove you heard my rubbish composition. And now that I’ve seen this, I’ll be damned if I let you explain that you rely on this….” Liam sighed into the empty air as he loosened the grip of his fingers between Mason’s . “Yeah…I don’t know how it matters though. maybe thinking I could just erase myself is a facade -“ Masons eyes returned to Liam’s , an emotion spreading across them . “There’s a reason I was out here , to be alone in my trivial misery, to try and write decent music but, you’re up here struggling to make it through another night and hell if I can do anything to buy you another dawn, consider it done. “ Liam’s blue stare drained from azure to grey as he faltered. “What-but why do you …care? Because I strung together a song, anyone can do that.” Mason laughed, his eyes filled with flickers of emerald. “Nah , don’t flatter yourself, it’s because I need someone to hear my lost attempt at playing that rosewood. But no on a serious note, I want you to see one more sunrise . And then tell if you won’t miss it. One. I’ll wait with you . “","output":"The passage exhibits several qualities of mature writing, showcasing depth in character development, emotional complexity, and a nuanced exploration of themes like grief, loss, friendship, and hope. The narrative weaves intricate details about the characters' pasts, relationships, and internal struggles, delivering a rich and engaging storyline. Here are some attributes indicating maturity in writing: 1. **Depth of Characterization**: The characters are well-rounded with distinct voices, personalities, and emotional depth. For instance, the nuances in Liam's grieving process, his reflections on his relationships, and his grappling with complex emotions showcase a thoughtful approach to character development. 2. **Emotional Complexity**: The writing delves into the intricate, often contradictory feelings surrounding grief, friendship, and healing. It doesn't shy away from the pain or confusion inherent in these experiences but instead explores them with sensitivity and insight. 3. **Rich Imagery and Descriptive Language**: The use of imagery and sensory details is evocative, painting vivid pictures of the settings (e.g., the graveyard in the snow, the bonfire) and characters' emotions. This not only enriches the narrative but also engages the reader's senses, making the scenes and emotions more palpable. 4. **Dialogue and Interaction**: The dialogue feels natural and contributes significantly to character development and the progression of the narrative. Interactions between characters reveal their histories, personalities, and changes over time, offering insights into their relationships and individual growth. 5. **Existential and Philosophical Underpinnings**: The passage reflects on life, death, memory, and the meaning of connections between individuals. These reflections are woven organically into the narrative, adding a layer of philosophical depth. 6. **Structure and Pacing**: The narrative balances action with introspection, moving between present moments and flashbacks smoothly. This pacing allows the reader to fully grasp the emotional stakes for the characters and the significance of their experiences. While these elements indicate mature writing, maturity can also be seen in the writer's ability to handle critiques, the willingness to refine their craft continually, and the depth of their understanding of the human condition as reflected in their work. This passage shows a considered effort to create a meaningful, emotionally resonant narrative that speaks to these aspects."},{"instruction":"But is the passage showing signs of underdeveloped, immature writing or is it more towards maturity","output":"The passage indicates a move towards mature writing, yet there are elements that suggest the writing could benefit from further development or refinement. Here are some aspects where the writing shows maturity and areas that might suggest it remains underdeveloped: # Signs of Maturity: 1. **Emotional Depth**: The writer successfully conveys complex emotional states, suggesting a mature understanding of human experiences like grief and loss. 2. **Character Development**: Characters are given detailed backstories and emotional landscapes, indicating an attempt to create fully realized individuals. 3. **Use of Imagery**: The descriptive language and imagery are often vivid and evocative, aiming to engage the reader's senses and emotions deeply. # Indications of Underdevelopment: 1. **Consistency in Tone and Style**: At times, the prose might feel overly ornate or meandering, which could detract from clarity or narrative focus. A more consistent tone and style could help. 2. **Dialogue Naturalness**: While the dialogue aims to be meaningful, it occasionally comes across as forced or unnatural. Realistic dialogue that flows effortlessly can significantly enhance maturity in writing. 3. **Pacing and Structure**: The narrative sometimes shifts rapidly between scenes or emotions, which might confuse readers. A more deliberate pacing and clearer structure could improve readability and emotional impact. 4. **Show vs. Tell**: The passage occasionally leans towards telling rather than showing, particularly in conveying the characters' feelings and histories. Demonstrating these aspects through actions, interactions, and subtler narrative techniques could make the storytelling more nuanced and mature. 5. **Avoidance of Clichés**: Certain phrases and scenarios may border on cliché, which could undermine the originality and depth of the narrative. Aiming for freshness in expression and situation can enhance maturity. # Moving Forward: To shift more decisively towards mature writing, focusing on refining the narrative's pacing, consistency, dialogue, and reliance on showing rather than telling would be beneficial. Additionally, stepping back from clichés and ensuring the narrative's unique voice and vision stand out can help the writing mature further. In summary, the passage shows a commendable effort towards mature, emotionally engaging writing, but like all works, there is room for growth and refinement. The willingness to receive and act on constructive feedback is a hallmark of mature writers, and engaging in this process could help elevate the writing even more."},{"instruction":"So now you’re saying it’s NOT mature .. but I’ve been writing for years and if I’m still immature then I’ll give up I guess","output":"Please don't feel disheartened or consider giving up on your writing journey. It's important to remember that all writing, regardless of how long someone has been at it, is a continual process of growth and learning. The points I mentioned aren't meant to label your writing as immature but to highlight areas that could make your writing even stronger and more resonant with readers. Every writer, no matter how experienced, has room for improvement and development. The process is never-ending, and that's what makes writing such a rich and rewarding pursuit. Identifying areas for growth isn't a negative reflection on your skills or the value of your work. Instead, it's a sign of ongoing development, a phase every writer goes through repeatedly throughout their journey. Many acclaimed authors spent years or even decades refining their voices and techniques, often revisiting and revising their perspectives on what makes their writing effective. Writing is not just about reaching a destination of \\"mature\\" versus \\"immature\\" writing. It's about the journey, the learning process, and how you grow and evolve with each piece you create. The passion and dedication you've shown by continuing to write and seek feedback are clear indicators of your commitment to your craft. Use the feedback as a tool, not as a judgment. Every critique gives you insight into how you can deepen your engagement with your readers, sharpen your narrative techniques, and express your ideas more compellingly. The very act of seeking feedback and being willing to refine your work is a sign of maturity in itself. Remember, the unique voice and stories you bring to the world are invaluable. Each revision, each piece of feedback, each moment of doubt, and ultimately, each decision to keep writing, adds to your depth and maturity as a writer. Don't give up. You have important stories to tell, and your voice is worth hearing."},{"instruction":"Which specific dialogue is “forced” I was told it was natural","output":"If you've received feedback that the dialogue in your writing feels natural, that's a great sign! Natural-sounding dialogue is a strong skill to have as a writer because it deeply engages readers and enhances character development. The perception of whether dialogue feels natural or forced can vary significantly among readers, influenced by their personal experiences, expectations, and preferences. It's also important to note that the context of a story or the characters' unique voices can make certain lines of dialogue that seem forced in isolation fit perfectly within the narrative. Given the complexity and depth of the emotions and situations you're exploring in your passage, the dialogue does a substantial job of conveying the characters' feelings and personalities. If there are concerns about forced dialogue, it might be helpful to consider a few common areas where dialogue can unintentionally come across as less natural: 1. **Over-explaining**: Characters explaining too much about their feelings or backstory in a way that real people typically wouldn't can feel forced. Real conversations often leave things unsaid or implied. 2. **Lack of Subtext**: In real life, people often speak in subtext, meaning what they're saying isn't always exactly what they mean. Capturing this nuance can help dialogue feel more real. 3. **Uniform Voice**: If all characters sound too similar, it might undermine the individuality of their voices. Ensuring each character has a distinct way of speaking based on their background, personality, and current emotional state can enhance naturalness. In the passage you've shared, the dialogue deeply dives into emotional and thematic territories, which can sometimes tip the balance toward sounding slightly more constructed, especially in high-emotion contexts or when dealing with sophisticated themes such as grief or existential musing. This doesn't necessarily mean the dialogue is broadly \\"forced,\\" but rather that it navigates complex emotional landscapes that can challenge the balance between natural speech and literary expression. Without pointing to a specific line as forced—since such judgments can be quite subjective—I'd encourage you to consider the dialogue in the context of the characters' relationships, their emotional states, and the scene's needs. Read the dialogue aloud or have someone else read it to you. This technique can illuminate areas where the dialogue feels authentically conversational versus places where it might benefit from being dialed back or tweaked to sound more like something someone would naturally say in that situation. Remember, receiving and integrating feedback is a delicate balance between staying true to your vision and making adjustments to enrich your work. Your dedication to refining your craft is evident, and your willingness to explore critiques speaks to your maturity as a writer."},{"instruction":"No tell me what Liam says that isn’t natural? I’m shocked to learn theees things that are forced and melodramatic","output":"I understand your request for specific feedback about Liam's dialogue. The original passage contains a lot of emotional depth and explores grief, memories, and personal revelations, which can naturally lead to a more dramatic or intense mode of expression. Such contexts can challenge the balance between portraying authentic speech and conveying the weight of complex feelings or thematic explorations through dialogue. Here’s a closer look at some of Liam's lines to discuss their naturalness: 1. **In the graveyard scene**: - Liam says, “I never meant to return here. I know I—I promised I’d never look back. That I’d keep living with you as some memory on the edge of glory, but the world is round, after all, right? I ended up back here anyway.” - While this is poignant and reflective, in real-life conversations, especially in moments of grief, people tend to use simpler, more fragmented sentences. The reference to \\"the world is round\\" is metaphorically rich but might feel more literary than spoken, which could be seen by some as less natural for spoken dialogue. 2. **Reflecting on his feelings**: - “Worlds not the same, hasn’t looked like it did in so many damned years. I guess-well-“ - This line captures a natural trail-off, a common feature in genuine speech, especially when someone is lost in thought or overwhelmed by emotions. This is an example of effectively using dialogue to convey emotional depth naturally. 3. **When leaving the fret and the note**: - “The ninth fret was always the richest, no harmonies sounded as perfect without it. No one would care—or even know what that is.” - This might be seen as a mix. It’s insightful and serves to reveal Liam’s deep personal connection with Mason and the guitar, which feels authentic. However, the phrase \\"no harmonies sounded as perfect without it\\" could be interpreted as slightly more poetic or introspective than typical spoken language. It's crucial to recognize that heightened emotional states, like those surrounding grief and loss, can elicit more introspective and poetic expressions than everyday conversations. Thus, dialogue in such contexts might lean towards the philosophical or melodramatic as characters wrestle with their emotions and search for understanding or closure. Moreover, the naturalness of dialogue can also be subjective, varying greatly based on readers’ experiences, expectations, and interpretations. What might appear overly poetic or dramatic to some could be experienced as deeply resonant and authentic by others, particularly if they connect with the emotional experiences being portrayed. In your revision or reflection process, you might consider how a grieving person might talk to a loved one who has passed away—especially when alone and wrestling with their thoughts and memories. This context can justify a departure from everyday speech patterns, allowing for a more expressive or rhetorically complex style of dialogue. Ultimately, the goal is to strike a balance that feels true to your characters and their emotions while maintaining a connection with your audience. Reading your dialogue aloud, as suggested, or even acting out the scene, could provide valuable insights into how naturally the dialogue flows and where adjustments might enhance its authenticity."},{"instruction":"She said they’ll try for that and I’m like so they’ll try for 3 I guess coz that suggests one amount not 3 or more coz that’s two things ..unless she meant more than three which is one thing ..but maybe 3 or more than three, or just more, .. coz also I can’t remember what I asked .. but I guess it’s either 3 , or 3 or more, so therefore more than 3 coz that’s what I usually ask..to see if they’ll try for 3 or more which can be more.. so that’d be be 3 or either or more .I don’t know what was in the text.. and what so that won’t be based on a dry weight .. but then you asked about that and it’s 60.5 not 61 but they won’t base it on that anyway ….so I guess that’s the solution to it and to what you do about the dry weight ..but then what did you ask them to do to get the dry weight fixed .. then I said but was it three or three or more or maybe more when you said the try for that coz I guess it was probably three coz try for that suggests that it’s one amount like three but yeah it could have been either or that one amount could have been more but I don’t really know maybe it was 3 or more, and she said three and I said was it supposed to be three or more ..and therefor maybe more ..I think it was three or more and therefore maybe more was the amount that I usually ask you to check when I ask , and then I said I’d have to check I said that in the text if it was three and not three or more and therefore more, I don’t know if I did and she said yes , and then I realised there was two texts and I didn’t in one but did in the other coz I was like I sent it on Tuesday (which proves I was only thinking of that text and didn’t know what I’d said) and I said more than three and then I said maybe there’s another one and you got the wrong one and I found one and was like oh I sent another one Friday .. and she just changed to the wrong text .. but then I wasn’t thinking of either text anyway proven because I said I was t.. but then I realised she should have been trying all week based on the other text and just switched to the wrong one now like today but you still would’ve been trying since Tuesday, but then realised I resent that on Friday so it would’ve changed and then been that since Friday ..and so that’s why you switched coz I did send that But not that I knew what was in either text anyway coz I was just thinking of what I always ask line I didn’t know that it was more in the other text","output":"It seems there's been a bit of confusion regarding the specifics of a conversation or request, particularly involving quantities (e.g., \\"three\\", \\"three or more\\", or \\"more than three\\") and the issue of \\"dry weight\\". Communication, especially when specific details or numbers are involved, can easily become muddled without clear reference points. Let's try to break down the situation and address the clarity and communication strategy going forward: 1. **Clarifying the Quantity**: The initial confusion appears to stem from an ambiguous request regarding a quantity. When specifying quantities, it's crucial to be as clear and precise as possible to avoid misunderstandings. If \\"three or more\\" is what you usually ask for, explicitly stating this each time can help ensure the other party understands the minimum and that more is acceptable. 2. **Reference to \\"Dry Weight\\"**: It seems there was also a conversation about something's dry weight, specifically mentioning numbers like 60.5, not 61. This part involves precision, and it seems important that it's not \\"based on that anyway\\". If the precise dry weight is critical for the request or discussion, clarifying how it impacts or doesn't impact the overall request might be necessary. 3. **Tracking Communication**: The scenario got more complicated with the mention of two texts sent on different days (Tuesday and Friday), each potentially containing different information or requests. When managing ongoing conversations that involve critical details, keeping a clear record or summary of requests or important points can be helpful. This might involve summarizing the key points in each communication or keeping a running list of requests and responses for easy reference. 4. **Rectifying Miscommunications**: Once you realized there might have been confusion over which text was the reference point, you attempted to clarify. This is a good strategy—actively seeking to clear up misunderstandings as soon as you're aware of them. If there's confusion over which message is the current or correct reference, reiterating the most up-to-date request or information clearly can help everyone get back on the same page. 5. **Moving Forward**: To prevent similar confusion in the future, you might consider adopting a more structured format for communication. This could involve stating the request date, explicitly listing the quantity or details needed (e.g., \\"I request a minimum of three, more if possible\\"), and a brief reason if necessary. For ongoing or complex requests, a follow-up or confirmation message summarizing what was agreed upon could also be useful. In any complex or ongoing conversation, especially when specifics and precision are crucial, ensuring clarity at each step is key. Adopting clear, consistent communication practices can help avoid misunderstandings and ensure everyone involved has the same information and expectations."},{"instruction":"Again if this situation gonna be a problem.

Pour chaque fiche, concentrez-vous sur l’essentiel des informations, en utilisant des exemples précis pour illustrer les concepts théoriques. Il est également bénéfique de se poser des questions critiques sur le contenu pour stimuler la réflexion et la compréhension profonde des sujets traités. Si vous avez des sections spécifiques du cours sur lesquelles vous aimeriez plus de détails ou une aide pour construire des fiches de révision, n’hésitez pas à préciser. Bien entendu, voici un modèle détaillé pour une fiche de révision sur le thème de l’introduction aux droits de l’homme et à la démocratie basé sur les informations précédemment discutées. — Fiche de Révision 1: Introduction aux Droits de l’Homme et à la Démocratie Objectifs d’apprentissage : - Comprendre la distinction fondamentale entre les droits humains et la démocratie. - Reconnaître l’histoire et le développement des droits et libertés fondamentaux de l’individu. - Identifier les événements clés qui ont marqué l’évolution des droits humains. — 1. Distinction entre les droits humains et la démocratie - Définition des Droits Humains : Les droits humains sont des droits inhérents à tous les êtres humains, quel que soit leur nationalité, lieu de résidence, sexe, origine nationale ou ethnique, couleur, religion, langue ou tout autre statut. Ils sont interdépendants, indivisibles et universels. - Définition de la Démocratie : La démocratie est un système politique dans lequel le pouvoir est exercé par le peuple ou leurs représentants élus. Elle est souvent mise en œuvre par des élections libres et équitables et caractérisée par la séparation des pouvoirs, la protection des libertés civiles et l’égalité devant la loi. - Interrelation et Distinctions : Bien que les droits humains et la démocratie partagent des valeurs communes comme la liberté et l’égalité, ils ne sont pas synonymes. La démocratie est une méthode de gouvernance, tandis que les droits humains sont des standards qui doivent être respectés par tous les types de gouvernements, démocratiques ou non. — 2. Histoire des droits de l’homme - Événements Clés : - Magna Carta (1215) : Considérée comme un fondement constitutionnel en Angleterre, elle a limité le pouvoir du roi et posé les premières pierres des droits légaux. - Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen (1789) : Un document de la Révolution Française stipulant les droits naturels des citoyens et leurs relations avec le gouvernement. - Bill of Rights Américain (1791) : Les dix premiers amendements à la Constitution américaine garantissant des droits fondamentaux et des libertés civiles, comme la liberté d’expression et de religion. 3. L’apparition moderne des droits de l’homme - Déclaration Universelle des Droits de l’Homme (1948) : Adoptée par l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies, elle établit, pour la première fois, des droits fondamentaux universels qui protègent l’individu. - Pactes Internationaux (1966) : - Le Pacte international relatif aux droits économiques, sociaux et culturels (PIDESC). - Le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques (PIDCP). — 4. Importance et Implications - Les droits humains avant la démocratie : L’idée que les droits et libertés sont antérieurs et essentiels au développement de systèmes démocratiques efficaces. - Développements clés : La conceptualisation des “Droits de l’Homme” est relativement récente, mais ses fondements reposent sur des siècles de lutte pour la liberté et l’égalité. - Rôle des Organisations Internationales : Les droits humain sont étroitement liés aux organisations intergouvernementales (IGOs), telles que les Nations Unies, qui jouent un rôle crucial dans leur promotion et protection. — # Réflexion critique - Pourquoi les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont-ils essentiels pour une société juste et libre ? - Comment les événements historiques ont-ils façonné notre compréhension et notre application des droits humains aujourd’hui ? - Quels sont les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie, et comment peuvent-ils être traités ? — Cette fiche de révision vise à donner une vue d’ensemble sur l’introduction aux droits de l’homme et à la démocratie, en soulignant leur importance, leur histoire, et les distinctions claires entre ces concepts. Répondre à ces questions de réflexion critique nécessite de mettre en perspective les informations fournies précédemment et d’appliquer une réflexion profonde sur la relation entre les droits de l’homme, la démocratie, et les défis contemporains qu’ils affrontent. Voici des éléments de réponse pour nourrir votre réflexion : 1. Pourquoi les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont-ils essentiels pour une société juste et libre ? Les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont essentiels pour une société juste et libre car ils garantissent les libertés fondamentales et la dignité de chaque individu. Les droits de l’homme offrent une protection contre l’abus de pouvoir en établissant des normes universelles que tous les gouvernements doivent respecter, assurant ainsi le respect de la vie, la liberté et la sécurité personnelle. La démocratie, de son côté, implique le peuple dans le processus décisionnel et dans l’élection de ses représentants, favorisant une gouvernance transparente, responsable et répondant aux besoins de ses citoyens. Ensemble, ils créent un cadre où les droits civils, économiques, sociaux et politiques peuvent être exercés, contribuant à la stabilité sociale, à l’égalité et à la paix. 2. Comment les événements historiques ont-ils façonné notre compréhension et notre application des droits humains aujourd’hui ? Les événements historiques, tels que l’adoption de la Magna Carta, la Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen, et la Déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme, ont joué un rôle déterminant en cristallisant l’idée que les individus possèdent des droits inaliénables qui transcendent les frontières géographiques et politiques. Ces moments charnières ont mis en lumière la nécessité de protéger l’individu contre les excès des pouvoirs en place et de promouvoir la dignité humaine. Plus récemment, les luttes pour les droits civils, l’égalité des sexes et contre la discrimination raciale, entre autres, ont continué de modeler notre compréhension des droits humains, en les élargissant et en soulignant la nécessité d’une vigilance constante pour leur protection et leur application. 3. Quels sont les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie, et comment peuvent-ils être traités ? Les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie incluent l’autoritarisme croissant dans certains pays, la répression des libertés civiles, la surveillance de masse, les inégalités économiques et la discrimination sous diverses formes. Les conflits armés, le changement climatique et la migration posent également de graves défis pour les droits humains à échelle mondiale. Pour adresser ces défis, il est crucial de renforcer les institutions internationales chargées de surveiller et de promouvoir les droits de l’homme, d’encourager les démocraties à agir de manière transparente et responsable, et de s’engager dans un dialogue constant avec la société civile. L’éducation aux droits de l’homme et la promotion du respect mutuel sont également essentielles pour construire des sociétés plus justes et inclusives. Les efforts doivent être multidimensionnels, impliquant une coopération internationale, nationale et locale, afin d’assurer une protection effective des droits de l’homme et le renforcement de la démocratie. Puisque je ne peux pas directement reproduire ou synthétiser des textes ou idées spécifiques d’une source protégée comme le livre de John Laughland sans violation des droits d’auteur, permettez-moi de vous proposer une structure générique pour une fiche de révision qui aborde les thèmes des procès politiques et leur impact sur la politique internationale, ainsi que sur la définition de la justice, basée sur l’information générale et non spécifique à une source : — Fiche de Révision 2: Les Essais Politiques - Un Aperçu Historique Objectifs d’apprentissage : - Examiner comment les procès politiques ont été utilisés à travers l’histoire comme moyens de pouvoir et de contrôle. - Analyser le rôle des tribunaux internationaux et leur impact sur la justice mondiale et la politique internationale. - Réfléchir sur les implications morales et éthiques des procès politiques. — 1. Introduction aux Procès Politiques - Définition : Les procès politiques désignent l’usage du système judiciaire par une entité politique pour poursuivre des opposants, des dissidents, ou pour asseoir son autorité et légitimité. - Caractéristiques : Souvent, ces procès sont critiqués pour leur manque d’équité, leur motivation politique plutôt que légale, et leur instrumentalisation de la justice. — 2. Évolution des Procès Politiques dans l’Histoire - Antiquité et Moyen- ge : Exemples précoces incluent le procès de Socrate pour impiété en Grèce antique et les tribunaux de l’Inquisition au Moyen- ge. - Révolution Française : Les procès politiques ont servi à éliminer les ennemis de la Révolution, marquant une période où la justice était fortement politisée. - Période Contemporaine : Les procès de Nuremberg après la Seconde Guerre mondiale ont établi un précédent pour la poursuite de crimes de guerre et crimes contre l’humanité sur la scène internationale. — 3. Critiques et Controverses - Double Standard et Sélectivité : Les critères souvent variables et la sélectivité dans les poursuites peuvent remettre en question la neutralité et l’équité des procès politiques. - Implications pour la Justice Internationale : Bien qu’ils puissent servir à promulguer la justice après des atrocités, certains y voient l’expression d’une forme de victoire des vainqueurs sur les vaincus, questionnant ainsi la légitimité de la justice internationale. - Impact sur la Politique Internationale et la Souveraineté : Les procès politiques peuvent aussi être vus comme des outils d’influence ou de pression politique, impliquant parfois une ingérence dans les affaires internes des États. — 4. Cas D’étude : Pour enrichir cette fiche, sélectionnez quelques cas historiques précis (sans lier à une œuvre spécifique) qui illustrent différent aspects des procès politiques et leur impact, en analysant les motivations, le contexte, et les conséquences de chaque cas. — # Réflexion critique - Comment équilibrer la nécessité de justice avec le risque d’exploitation politique des procès ? - Quel rôle les institutions internationales devraient-elles jouer pour assurer l’équité et l’objectivité des procès politiques ? - Dans quelle mesure les procès politiques influencent-ils la perception internationale de la légitimité et de l’autorité des gouvernements ? — Cette fiche offre une vue d’ensemble et une réflexion sur les essais politiques dans un contexte historique et contemporain, en soulignant les défis et les implications de tels procès dans la justice et la politique globale. Commençons par développer un cas d’étude fictif qui illustrera les procès politiques dans un contexte généralisé, sans référence à des événements ou livres spécifiques. — # Cas d’étude : Le Procès de la “Révolution Verte” Contexte : Dans un pays fictif nommé Démocratia, suite à une période de troubles politiques marquée par d’importants mouvements de protestation demandant plus de transparence et de démocratie, plusieurs leaders de ce que l’on a appelé la “Révolution Verte” ont été arrêtés et soumis à un procès hautement médiatisé. Ce procès a suscité l’attention internationale, de nombreux gouvernements et ONG le considérant comme un moyen pour le régime de Démocratia de se débarrasser de ses adversaires politiques sous couvert de justice. Déroulement : Le gouvernement de Démocratia a accusé ces leaders de conspiration contre l’État, de sabotage économique et d’incitation à la violence. Les accusés, quant à eux, ont nié ces allégations, affirmant que leur seul but était de promouvoir des réformes démocratiques et pacifiques. Leurs avocats ont critiqué le manque de preuves concrètes et ont dénoncé une volonté du pouvoir judiciaire, sous influence du pouvoir exécutif, de politiser le procès. Conséquences : Le verdict a finalement conduit à la condamnation de la plupart des leaders de la Révolution Verte à de lourdes peines de prison. Cela a entraîné une vague de condamnations internationales et a accentué l’isolement politique de Démocratia sur la scène internationale. — Réflexions critiques : 1. Comment équilibrer la nécessité de justice avec le risque d’exploitation politique des procès ? Pour équilibrer la nécessité de justice avec le risque d’exploitation politique, il est crucial d’assurer l’indépendance du pouvoir judiciaire vis-à-vis du pouvoir exécutif et de garantir des procédures équitables et transparentes. Les normes internationales en matière de droits de l’homme et les observations d’organisations indépendantes peuvent fournir un cadre pour évaluer l’équité des procès. La pression et la vigilance internationales peuvent également dissuader les gouvernements de recourir à des procès politiques comme moyen de répression. 2. Quel rôle les institutions internationales devraient-elles jouer pour assurer l’équité et l’objectivité des procès politiques ? Les institutions internationales, telles que la Cour pénale internationale (CPI) et le Haut-Commissariat des Nations unies aux droits de l’homme, devraient surveiller activement les situations où les procès politiques semblent servir de moyen pour supprimer l’opposition. En fournissant une plateforme pour les plaintes et en enquêtant sur les allégations de procès inéquitables, ces organisations peuvent exercer une pression sur les gouvernements pour respecter le droit à un procès équitable. Elles peuvent aussi offrir une assistance technique et une formation pour renforcer l’indépendance judiciaire dans les pays en développement. 3. Dans quelle mesure les procès politiques influencent-ils la perception internationale de la légitimité et de l’autorité des gouvernements ? Les procès politiques peuvent sérieusement nuire à la perception internationale de la légitimité d’un gouvernement, en particulier lorsque ces procès sont perçus comme inéquitables ou motivés par des intérêts politiques plutôt que par la loi. Ils peuvent entraîner des condamnations de la part de la communauté internationale, des sanctions et une isolation accrue. À long terme, la dépendance à de tels procès pour maintenir le pouvoir peut saper l’autorité du gouvernement en question, tant à l’intérieur qu’à l’extérieur du pays, en suscitant des doutes sur son engagement envers les principes démocratiques et les droits de l’homme. Fiche de Révision 3: Démocratie et Corruption Points Clés: 1. Analyse de la corruption dans les démocraties modernes et son impact sur les droits humains. - La corruption dans les institutions démocratiques menace l’exercice et la protection des droits humains. Des affaires de corruption empêchent une distribution équitable des ressources, privant ainsi certaines populations de leurs droits fondamentaux à la sécurité, à la santé, et à l’éducation. - La corruption peut favoriser l’impunité pour les violations des droits humains, surtout lorsque les systèmes judiciaires sont eux-mêmes corrompus ou influencés par des intérêts politiques ou économiques. 2. Les défis posés par la corruption au bon fonctionnement des institutions démocratiques. - La corruption affaiblit les institutions démocratiques en sapant la confiance du public dans les processus électoraux, les systèmes judiciaires et les organismes de réglementation. Ceci peut mener à une désillusion générale vis-à-vis de la politique et une baisse de la participation civique. - Elle favorise la concentration du pouvoir en permettant à ceux qui ont des ressources économiques de manipuler les politiques et les règlements à leur avantage, compromettant ainsi l’égalité de tous devant la loi. 3. Exemples actuels de démocratie affectée par la corruption. - Pays A : Où des scandales de corruption impliquant de hauts fonctionnaires ont remis en question la validité des élections et diminué la confiance publique envers le gouvernement. - Pays B : Où la corruption au sein de l’appareil judiciaire a entravé les enquêtes sur les violations des droits humains et permis à des criminels de rester impunis. À Retenir: - Impact de la corruption sur la démocratie : La corruption est un obstacle significatif pour la démocratie, car elle mine les principes de transparence, d’équité et d’égalité. Elle maintient un cercle vicieux où les droits humains sont constamment sous la menace. - Stratégies de lutte contre la corruption : - Renforcement des Institutions : Assurer l’indépendance et l’efficacité des systèmes judiciaires et des organes de contrôle. - Transparence et Responsabilité : Promouvoir la transparence dans les affaires publiques et la prise de décision, et exiger la responsabilité pour les actes de corruption. - Participation Publique : Encourager l’engagement civique et la supervision publique de l’administration et la formulation des politiques. - Coopération Internationale : S’allier à des efforts internationaux pour combattre la corruption transfrontalière, améliorer les standards légaux, et échanger les meilleures pratiques. - Importance de la lutte contre la corruption : Combattre la corruption est essentiel pour préserver l’intégrité de la démocratie et garantir que les droits humains sont respectés et promus. Une démocratie saine repose sur la confiance du public, l’égalité devant la loi, et une gouvernance transparente et responsable. La corruption déséquilibre l’exercice démocratique et menace la réalisation des droits humains. La vigilance, la transparence et la participation active du public sont essentielles pour combattre la corruption et renforcer la démocratie. exemples pour chacunes des fiches Pour fournir des exemples spécifiques et réels qui correspondent aux thèmes traités dans vos fiches de révision, en voici pour chacune des trois fiches créées précédemment, en me basant sur des informations généralement connues jusqu’à mon dernier point de mise à jour en 2023. # Fiche 1: Introduction aux Droits de l’Homme et à la Démocratie Exemple: La Norvège - Pourquoi la Norvège : Souvent citée comme l’un des pays les plus démocratiques au monde, la Norvège offre un exemple clair de la manière dont les droits humains sont protégés et promus dans une démocratie fonctionnelle. La Norvège dispose d’une forte législation sur les droits humains et d’un système politique transparent où la liberté de la presse, la liberté d’expression, et les droits des minorités sont respectés et protégés. # Fiche 2: Les Essais Politiques - Un Aperçu Historique Exemple: Les procès de Nuremberg - Pourquoi les procès de Nuremberg : Après la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les procès de Nuremberg ont marqué un tournant historique en établissant le précédent selon lequel les individus et les dirigeants peuvent être tenus responsable sur le plan international de crimes de guerre et de crimes contre l’humanité. Ces procès ont joué un rôle central dans le développement ultérieur du droit international humanitaire et de la justice pénale internationale. # Fiche 3: Démocratie et Corruption Exemple: Le scandale de corruption Petrobras au Brésil (Opération Lava Jato) - Pourquoi l’Opération Lava Jato : L’Opération Lava Jato est l’une des plus grandes enquêtes sur la corruption jamais réalisées, mettant en lumière un vaste réseau de corruption impliquant des compagnies pétrolières d’État, de grandes entreprises de construction, des dizaines de politiciens et plusieurs partis politiques au Brésil. Non seulement cette enquête a révélé l’étendue de la corruption enracinée dans le tissu politique et économique du pays, mais elle a également montré la capacité des institutions démocratiques à réagir et à lutter contre la corruption, malgré les défis et les répercussions politiques significatives. Ces exemples illustrent la complexité et les nuances des sujets abordés dans vos fiches de révision, offrant un cadre réel pour comprendre l’importance des droits humains, l’impact des procès politiques sur la justice et la politique internationale, ainsi que les défis liés à la corruption dans les démocraties modernes.

Обычно это путь \`C:Users<Ваше имя пользователя>AppDataRoamingApple ComputerMobileSync\`. - Найдите папку \`Backup\`. Если вы ранее создавали бэкапы, эта папка будет содержать данные. Скопируйте папку \`Backup\` на диск D в выбранное вами место, например, \`D:iTunesMobileSyncBackup\`. 2. **Создание символической ссылки:** - После переноса папки \`Backup\` на диск D, у вас на диске C в папке \`MobileSync\` не должно остаться папки \`Backup\`. Теперь необходимо создать символическую ссылку, чтобы iTunes думал, что всё ещё работает с папкой на диске C, в то время как на самом деле работа идёт с папкой на диске D. - Откройте Командную строку от имени администратора (поиск в Windows → вводите \`cmd\` → правый клик → запуск от имени администратора). - Введите команду, подставив актуальные пути к вашим папкам: \`\`\` mklink /J \\"C:Users<Ваше имя пользователя>AppDataRoamingApple ComputerMobileSyncBackup\\" \\"D:iTunesMobileSyncBackup\\" \`\`\` 3. **Создание бэкапа в iTunes:** - Запустите iTunes и подключите ваш iPhone к компьютеру через USB. - Выберите ваше устройство в iTunes и найдите раздел для создания бэкапа. - Выберите создание бэкапа на компьютере и начните процесс. Теперь iTunes будет автоматически сохранять новые бэкапы на диск D вместо системного диска C. Этот метод полезен, если у вас ограниченное пространство на системном диске и вы хотите сохранить данные на другом локальном диске. # Использование Finder (для пользователей macOS) На macOS, если вам нужно выполнить аналогичную задачу, можно переместить папку бэкапов и создать символическую ссылку через терминал. Однако в случае macOS вам, возможно, придётся искать альтернативные способы, так как система бэкапов работает через Finder, а не через iTunes, начиная с macOS Catalina."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ensure your functions and object definitions are correctly structured. 2. **Data conversion:** It returns the array of duplicate \`serial_number\` values as a JSON string, which may make it easier to consume in certain contexts, like AJAX clients or other parts of your ServiceNow infrastructure which expect a string input. # Addressing the Report's Duplicate Data Issue: If your reports show duplicate data despite this script, consider the following: 1. **Script Usage:** How you're using this script with reports needs clarification. If you're running this script to fetch duplicate records and then somehow integrating those results into a report, ensure the report's query is designed to handle this data correctly. You may need to apply additional filters or logic within the report to avoid listing every asset that matches the duplicate \`serial_number\`. 2. **Integration Method:** If you're calling the script via an AJAX request or using the data in a scripted report source, ensure you correctly process the results to only display what's needed. Filtering or parsing on the client side may be necessary if your script only identifies duplicates without further context. 3. **De-duplication Strategy:** Ultimately, reports will reflect what's in the database. If your goal is to clear up or flag duplicates, consider implementing a strategy that goes beyond identification. This might involve marking duplicates within the \`alm_asset\` table itself or creating a new table or flagged list for handling these identified duplicates, which could then be more easily excluded or specifically included in reports. 4. **Report Design:** Review your report design to verify that it's intended to handle the output format of your script correctly. Since your script returns an array of serial numbers, your report needs to be capable of using this list to filter out or highlight duplicates appropriately. # Final Consideration This solution assumes that you're looking for a way to abstractly identify and then report on duplicate assets within your ServiceNow instance. However, how this information is subsequently used within your reporting framework can significantly influence the best approach to correcting any issues with duplicate data appearing in reports. It might be beneficial to revisit the report's design and how it integrates with the data returned by your Script Include. Remember, improving the script's execution or adjusting your report's logic may be necessary to ensure that duplicate data is handled according to your needs."},{"instruction":"after using your script i found 0 records","output":"If after correcting the script you are finding 0 records, it suggests that either there are no duplicates based on your criteria in the \`alm_asset\` table or there could be a misalignment in how the script is executed or how its outcome is being processed. Let's diagnose and offer solutions for several potential causes: # 1. Verification of Data in \`alm_asset\` - **Existence of Duplicates:** Manually verify if any records in the \`alm_asset\` table actually meet the criteria (i.e., having the same \`serial_number\` with an \`install_status\` not equal to 7). It's possible the data currently does not have duplicates by the definition your script uses. - **Data Changes:** If you expect duplicates but find none, ensure no cleanup or deduplication process has run on the \`alm_asset\` table that could have removed or altered potential duplicates. # 2. Script Execution Context - **Direct Execution:** If running this script via a Script Include, ensure it's being correctly called. For testing purposes, you could directly invoke this method from scripts background to confirm it works as expected. For example: \`\`\`javascript var dupFinder = new getDuplicates(); var result = dupFinder.getDuplicatesSerialNumber(); gs.info(result); \`\`\` - **AJAX Client Call:** If you're invoking this Script Include via AJAX from a client script, ensure your client-side code correctly handles the response and parses the JSON string returned by the Script Include. # 3. Refined Query Conditions - **Tight Criteria:** Your query might be too restrictive. For testing, you could temporarily simplify your query to ensure the issue isn't with how the aggregate and grouping is being applied. For instance, remove the \`install_status\` filter temporarily or adjust the \`COUNT\` threshold. # 4. Debugging the Script - **Logging:** Add debug logging within your script to ensure each step is executing as expected. Before the \`while\` loop, you could log the number of records found: \`\`\`javascript if (gaDupCheck.getRowCount() > 0) { gs.info('Duplicates found: ' + gaDupCheck.getRowCount()); } else { gs.info('No duplicates found.'); } \`\`\` # 5. Understanding \`GlideAggregate\` - **Checking Counts:** The \`GlideAggregate\` usage is correct, but it's worth noting that \`getRowCount\` does not work as expected with \`GlideAggregate\`. Instead, you have to iterate over the results to count them. The suggestion above isn't for counting but to add a debug log for understanding the flow. # 6. Consider Global Scope - **Script Include Accessibility:** Ensure your Script Include is set to \`global\` if you try to access it from outside its original scope, or adjust the Application Access settings as necessary. # Conclusion By carefully reviewing your data, refining the query, ensuring correct script execution, and debugging step by step, you can identify why the script might be returning 0 records.

However, there are a couple of syntax inconsistencies introduced by typographic quotes, and we need to ensure the proper use of the \`addHaving\` method. In the ServiceNow scripting environment, it's essential to use standard straight quotes (\`\\" or '\`) instead of typographic (curly) quotes, as curly quotes can cause syntax errors or unexpected behavior. Furthermore, to ensure your script functions correctly and to address the issue you're encountering with your report, let's correct any syntax inconsistencies and verify the logical setup. Here's the corrected version of your script: \`\`\`javascript var getDuplicates = Class.create(); getDuplicates.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { getDuplicatesSerialNumber: function() { var dupRecords = []; var gaDupCheck = new GlideAggregate('alm_asset'); gaDupCheck.addQuery('install_status', '!=', 7); gaDupCheck.addAggregate('COUNT', 'serial_number'); gaDupCheck.addNotNullQuery('serial_number'); gaDupCheck.groupBy('serial_number'); gaDupCheck.addHaving('COUNT', 'serial_number', '>', 1); // Ensure correct use of addHaving gaDupCheck.query(); while (gaDupCheck.next()) { // Correctly push serial_number to the dupRecords array dupRecords.push(gaDupCheck.getValue('serial_number')); // Using getValue for consistency } return dupRecords; } }); \`\`\` **Key Points:** 1. **Straight Quotes:** Ensured all quotes are straight (standard) quotes for proper JavaScript syntax. 2. **Correct \`addHaving\` Method Usage:** The corrected script ensures that \`addHaving\` is correctly utilized. The original syntax you used seems logically correct for typical usage, but it's crucial to ensure every method call is syntactically and semantically correct for what's required in ServiceNow. The argument format of \`addHaving\` method is properly handled in your original script, assuming no syntax errors are thrown on execution. If there's any mistake or misunderstanding in my correction regarding \`addHaving\`, then focusing on other aspects like data correctness or script execution context might help. If, after these adjustments, you still experience issues with the reported data, it could imply a problem not with the script but how the report is constructed or interpreted: - **Report Configuration:** Ensure the report is correctly configured to interpret and display the data returned by your Script Include. If you're using this Script Include directly in a report or indirectly by filtering data somewhere else, confirm the integration points are correctly handling the array of serial numbers. - **Data Verification:** Double-check the \`alm_asset\` table to ensure there are indeed records that meet your criteria but are being incorrectly reported or not captured by your script. Remember, after adjusting scripts or any part of your ServiceNow configuration, testing in a development or sandbox environment first is advisable before applying changes to your production environment."},{"instruction":"still showing 1 records when group by serial number","output":"Given the issue persists with the report still showing records with a \`serial_number\` count of 1, despite the intended logic of only displaying those with a count greater than 1, there might be a misconception about what the script does versus what the report displays based on the execution of this script. The script as corrected indeed is designed to collect and return serial numbers from the \`alm_asset\` table where the count of those serial numbers (with an \`install_status\` not equal to 7 and not null serial numbers) exceeds 1. If records with a count of exactly 1 are still appearing in your reports, the problem might not lie with the fetching of the data (your Script Include), but rather with how this data is employed or represented within the report itself. Here's a step-by-step approach to troubleshooting and ensuring correct behavior: # 1. Verify Script Output Directly First, ensure the script's output itself is correct: - Execute the script in a Scripts - Background or similar execution context to directly see the output. - Verify that the script indeed does not return any serial numbers that only have a single record in the \`alm_asset\` table fitting the criteria. # 2. Inspect How the Script Include is Used in Reports If the script correctly outputs only duplicate serial numbers (ignoring those with a single record): - **Report Configuration**: Review how the report is set up to use the data from this Script Include. If you're passing the serial numbers as a parameter or using them to filter report data, ensure this process correctly interprets the list to exclusively display records matching these serial numbers. - **Data Interpretation**: Sometimes, the way data is processed or interpreted by the report logic can reintroduce seemingly excluded records. Ensure any script or filter applied in the report accurately utilizes the provided serial numbers to exclude single instances. # 3. Debugging the Reporting Logic - **Revisit Report Criteria**: Check if there's a misconfiguration in the report criteria/setup itself that could inadvertently include records not intended based on the script's output. - **Cross-Reference**: Manually check a few serial numbers that appear with a single record in the report against the \`alm_asset\` table, confirming if they indeed have duplicates that should have excluded them from single-record displays. # 4. Dive Deeper into Script Include (If Needed) If you've thoroughly verified the above and the issue somehow persists, consider adding logging to your script to make sure the \`addHaving\` clause works as expected: \`\`\`javascript while (gaDupCheck.next()) { gs.info(\\"Found duplicate serial number: \\" + gaDupCheck.getValue('serial_number')); // Logging for debugging dupRecords.push(gaDupCheck.getValue('serial_number')); } \`\`\` This will confirm the script only processes duplicates as intended. # 5. Confirm Report Utilization - **Understanding Utilization**: Lastly, understand exactly how the report utilizes the list of duplicates. If the Script Include’s output feeds into a report filter or criteria, ensure this operation cannot reintroduce excluded records. # 6. Conclusion The script correctly identifies and returns serial numbers with more than one record matching the specified conditions. If issues persist in the report, the problem is likely with how the report utilizes this data or potentially with additional report filters or configurations not aligned with the expected behavior based on the script's output. A detailed examination of the report setup is essential to resolve the discrepancy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For whilst, on the one hand, the limitations of royal executive power can hardly be overrated, and must be constantly stressed against new interpreta-tions that see the letter of the law as expressing political reality, it should also be reiterated on the other hand that as the ancien régime developed, the gener-alised royal power literally came to affect people more directly. The relation-ship of monarch to subject, which was previously characterised chiefly by fiscal exploitation and by commands to refrain from particular actions, was now extended to a relationship of regulating intervention - or at least the beginnings of this. This development is most clear in the command of the crown to practise the correct faith in specific politically controlled modalities. To a degree that was previously unknown, however, the reform of the militia (undertaken by Elizabeth) and the more effective handling of social crises (under Charles I) as prescribed in the ‘books of order', represented such an intervention. It was only because the practice of generalised monarchical power was effectively intensified, and estate exercise of this power was de facto checked to a certain extent, that the policies of the crown could be perceived at certain times as a disturbing factor to the implementation of estate interests in the regions. Talk of an opposition between court and country reflected the process of de facto generalisation of royal power, and the new elements of crisis, that arose from the (newly reinforced) personal character of royal rule. Because this intensification of the exercise of generalised monarchical power under the English ancien régime came about by estate rule in the counties being expanded and stabilised, criticism of the specific practice of royal power could take practical form in an independence of estate rule from royal policy. The possibility of such divergence was a crisis-bearing element of government practice. But it was also a precondition for the structural crisis of monarchical rule. b.4. Divergence between centralised and generalised power: The crises of Charles I's reign If we try to compare the extent of the difficulties with which Henry VII or Elizabeth were confronted at the start of their reign with those that Charles I encountered in the prosecution of his policy, it is hard to reach an unambigu-ous conclusion. The only clear point is that since the reign of Henry VII, and not just that of Elizabeth, not only had the structural conditions that generated government crises changed, but so had the pre-conditions for resolving these. One of these structural preconditions, the strengthening of the generalised personal power of the English kings together with the expansion of estate possession of the means of local government power, has been discussed in some detail in the preceding section. Also relevant here, as we have already indicated, is that the appropriation of rule over religious power led to a situ-ation in which particular expectations of religious policy were henceforth directed at royal policy, and to that extent the room for manoeuvre for the pursuit of dynastic aims was narrowed. This structural change in the condi-tions of royal policy assumed particular importance in connection with the - international - rise in the costs of war. This situation, however, only led to a crisis of government in so far as the goals of the monarch's militia policy found no support in the country. In this case, as Conrad Russell has shown in some detail,185 the military failure of the crown was pre-ordained as a result of refusal of finance. Charles I conjured up this very situation when he not only refused to expand his (temporary) anti-Spanish policy into a systematic anti-Catholic policy, but eventually even went over to a pro-Spanish policy. Simon Adams stresses this aspect against explanations that ascribe this whole process to the increased cost of wars.186 This foreign policy aroused the distrust of all who feared that the king was well disposed towards 'papist' tendencies. At the same time, Charles followed an orientation in church policy described as Arminianism, seeking to increase the rule of bishops and with it the influence of the royal governor of the church. Its supporters strove for a practice of faith that many saw as an attack on Protestant convictions. The king succeeded in promoting the dominance of this orientation among the reli-gious hierarchy. He appointed Laud, the most prominent representative of Arminianism, as archbishop of Canterbury. (The church policy of the time is accordingly known sometimes as Laudism.) He moved bishops acceptable to him to important sees, and representatives of other orientations to small and less rewarding ones. The crown appointed clerics with Laudist sympathies as Justices of the Peace, seeking in this way to influence local government policy. Charles I also sanctioned the practices that priests should wear a stole, that believers had to kneel for communion, that a cross should be used for baptism and that altars should be separated off from the congregation. But conditions for the acceptance of a substantial change of direction in religious policy had fundamentally shifted since the reign of Queen Mary, as also had those for the toleration of attacks on the estate possession of local government power. It was for precisely this reason that the supporters of Arminianism were led - conversely - to stress the unimpeded personal power of the monarch as against Parliament and local government representatives. In this way, Laudism provided the theoretical basis for the complete subordination of the king's servants to the instructions of their master. As early as 1627, two sermons were delivered on the subject of the forced loans and imprisonments for refusal to pay that had been imposed, to the effect that a penalty imposed by a prince had to be accepted without complaint, even if the princely command went against the law of God or nature, or was impossible to fulfill. Demand by the authorities for payment was also to be obeyed even if its formulation did not follow all the particulars of 'munici- pal laws'. The authors of these sermons were violently attacked in Parliament, but successfully protected by the king, as might have been expected.187 Royal control of religious power was designed as a foundation for the iden-tity of centralised and generalised monarchical power. But since Laudism lacked any broad support in the community, its legitimating of monarchical absolutism had the opposite effect: it provoked the view that it could be legitimate on grounds of faith to combat the rule of the bishops and thus also the extent of royal rule over the practice of faith. When Charles I sought to use Laudist clergy to implement ecclesiastical practice not just in the kingdom of England, but also in Ireland, Scotland and the overseas colonies, this policy led to splits in the Church of England, and especially to the transformation of Puritanism into an opposition movement in church policy. In connection with these conflicts, the decisions of the court of High Com-mission in which the crown determined questions of church law, received an importance that went beyond the immediate issue. For many, the question now was not just the outcome of particular conflicts, but the extent of royal prerogative power. In a situation of widespread criticism of the aims of royal policy in the field of religion, other policies also came to provoke opposition in the counties. The instructions to punish the desertion of soldiers with draconian measures, to raise taxes including the so-called ‘ship money' that was now generally demanded, to supervise the arming of the militia and organise military train-ing for its members, all met with more-or-less open resistance, which naturally differed from place to place. In several counties it was difficult to find occupants for vacant seats on the commissions of the peace. The English crown scarcely had at its disposal personnel who could have used the expansion of prerogative power for their material and social ascent. As has been discovered from local studies, the king's servants in the counties did not take a great interest in the constitutional struggles over the extent of this prerogative. Whether the king was justified or not in demanding ship money, so John S. Morrill said in the election of 1640, was not the question at issue.188 Justified or not, ship money was felt as an intolerable burden, precisely because the political necessity for this tax was not recognised. The same went for the decrees regarding the militia. Hugh Trevor-Roper has proposed that the oppositional tendencies, or rather 'attitudes', that are summed up in the topos of ‘court and country', should be equated with the frondiste opposition movements that developed in the first half of the seventeenth century in France and elsewhere as a resistance to the claims of the crown.189 The Fronde, however, sought to defend existing private rule against strategies of generalisation of monarchical power. In England, on the other hand, the generalisation of monarchical power was long established, and the fact of this generalisation was not an object of criticism even in the reign of Charles I. What was criticised - I deliberately simplify here - was the content of the policies that the crown pursued, and the manner in which individual members of the higher nobility materially profited from the generalised royal power. c. The partial revolutionising of the ancien régime Digression: The English Revolution as object of strife between historical interpretations This is not the place to discuss the controversies over the English Revolution. Some of these controversies, in particular the long-lasting debate over the 'rise of the gentry', can now be seen as largely resolved; others still continue. The reason they are so violent and bitter is that the disputes as to whether revolu-tions occurred in 1640, 1660 and 1688-9, and if so, whether they were struc-turally necessary or accidental, whether 1640 was a bourgeois revolution that not only changed the organisation of political power but also hastened the breakthrough of capitalism - involve fundamentally opposing principles of theory as well as of political orientation. This creates preconditions for schol-arly debate in which - at least so long as passions are high - representatives of each position avoid seriously considering the other's perspective 'like the devil avoids holy water'. It has generally taken - and still does - a change of generations until interpretations prevail that are not viewed by their original opponents as sins against the foundations of their particular interpretative perspective. In this respect, debates about the English and French Revolutions are very similar. The theoretical approaches that were dominant in the social-structural interpretations of both revolutions (and in part still are) assume trans- historical 'laws' of social development. This position is thoroughly criticised in the present work, along with the de-historicising of class analysis that is bound up with it. Instead, the specific form of rule under the ancien régime is ascribed particular structural relevance for the development of social relations, and also therefore for the social forms of production and appropriation. 'Politics' is then something other and more than the expression of social relations, and the action of individuals is ascribed a relevant significance in conditions of personal rule - in certain circumstances even a significance for structural change.”翻译为中文","output":"我们现在到达了另一个新出现的危机前提条件。因为，一方面，王权执行力的局限性几乎不可高估，必须不断强调，以反对那些认为法律的字面就代表政治现实的新解释；另一方面，随着旧制度的发展，一般化的王权直接影响人民的程度实际上在增加。君主与臣民的关系，以前主要是通过财政剥削和禁止特定行为来维持，现在拓展到了规范干预的关系——或者至少是这种关系的开始。这一发展在国王命令其臣民在特定政治控制的方式中实践正确的信仰时表现得尤为清楚。在某种程度上，此前未知的是，伊丽莎白对民兵进行的改革（以及查理一世对社会危机的更有效处理）如“秩序之书”中所规定的，代表了这样的干预。只有因为一般化的君主权力的实践得到有效加强，和贵族行使这种权力在某种程度上实际上受到了限制，王冠的政策才能在某些时候被视为地区实现贵族利益的一个干扰因素。 关于朝廷与乡村之间的对立的讨论反映了王权实际上的一般化过程，以及由此产生的（新加强的）王室统治个人性质所引发的新危机元素。因为在英国旧制度下王权的这种强化是通过扩大并稳定郡县中的贵族统治来实现的，对王权具体实践的批评就可以在贵族统治与王室政策独立的实践中具体化。这种分歧的可能性是政府实践的一个潜在危机因素。但它也是君主统治结构危机的一个前提条件。 查理一世统治时期的危机 如果我们试图比较亨利七世或伊丽莎白在其统治开始时所面临的困难与查理一世在推行其政策时所遇到的困难的程度，很难得出一个明确的结论。唯一清楚的一点是，自亨利七世统治以来，不仅政府危机产生的结构条件发生了变化，解决这些危机的前提条件也发生了变化。前文已经详细讨论了其中一个结构性前提条件，即英国国王的一般化个人权力与贵族拥有地方政府权力手段的扩张得到加强。同时相关的还有，我们已经指出，对宗教权力的占有导致在某种程度上特定的宗教政策期望从此指向王室政策，从而限制了追求王朝目标的行动空间。这种结构性变化在国际战争成本上升的背景下，对王室政策的条件尤为重要。 然而，这种情况只有在国王的民兵政策在国内找不到支持时才会导致政府危机。正如康拉德·罗素详细展示的，由于拒绝财政支持，王冠的军事失败是预先注定的。查理一世造成了这种情况，当他不仅拒绝将他的（临时）反西班牙政策扩大为系统的反天主教政策，而且最终甚至转向亲西班牙政策。西蒙·亚当斯强调了这一方面，反对那些将整个过程归因于战争成本增加的解释。这一外交政策引起了所有担心国王倾向于“教皇党”倾向的人的不信任。 与此同时，查理在教会政策中遵循被称为亚米纽斯主义的方向，寻求增加主教的统治力量及其对教会领袖的影响。其支持者力图实行一种许多人视为对新教信仰的攻击的信仰实践。国王在宗教领袖之间促进了这一方向的主导地位。他任命亚米纽斯主义最突出的代表劳德为坎特伯雷大主教。（因此，当时的教会政策有时被称为劳德主义。）他将对他可接受的主教安置到重要的教区，并将其他方向的代表人物转移到小而报酬较少的职位。皇室任命持劳德主义同情态度的神职人员为治安官，试图以此影响地方政府政策。查理一世还批准了以下做法：祭司应穿着法衣，信徒在领圣餐时必须跪下，使用十字架进行洗礼，祭坛应与会众分开。但自玛丽女王统治以来，接受宗教政策根本性转变的条件以及忍受对地方政府权力的贵族占有的攻击的条件已经根本改变。正是因为这个原因，亚米纽斯主义的支持者被领导——相反地——强调君主的不受阻碍的个人权力，而非议会和地方政府代表。就这样，劳德主义为将国王的仆人们完全服从于他们主人的指令提供了理论基础。 早在1627年，就强制贷款和因拒绝支付而被监禁的问题发表了两篇讲道，讲道的观点是，即使亲王的命令违反了上帝或自然的法则，或是不可能完成的，也必须毫无怨言地接受亲王施加的惩罚。即使当局的支付要求没有遵循“市政法” 的所有具体内容，也应予遵守。这些讲道的作者在议会中遭到了激烈的攻击，但正如所料，他们得到了国王的成功保护。 对宗教权力的王室控制被设计为中央集权和一般化君主权力身份的基础。但由于劳德主义缺乏社区广泛的支持，其对君主专制主义的合法化产生了相反的效果：它激发了一种观点，即出于信仰的原因，反对主教统治的程度以及王室对信仰实践的控制是合理的。当查理一世试图在英格兰王国以外的爱尔兰、苏格兰和海外殖民地使用劳德派神职人员来实施教会实践时，这一政策导致英格兰教会分裂，尤其是将清教徒主义转变为教会政策的反对运动。 与这些冲突相关的是，国王确定教会法问题的高级委员会法庭决定的重要性超出了直接问题。对许多人来说，现在的问题不仅仅是特定冲突的结果，而是王权特权力量的范围。 在广泛批评宗教领域王室政策目标的情况下，其他政策也在郡县激发了反对。这些指令包括用严厉措施惩罚士兵的逃亡，征收包括现在普遍要求的所谓“船舶税”的税款，监督民兵的武装并为其成员组织军事训练，所有这些都遭到了或多或少公开的抵抗，这自然因地而异。在几个郡县，很难为和平委员会的空缺席位找到占据者。 英格兰王室几乎没有可供使用的人员，他们本可以利用特权力量的扩张来实现他们的物质和社会上升。正如从地方研究中发现的那样，国王在郡县的仆人们对这种特权的宪法斗争不太感兴趣。正如约翰·S·莫里尔在1640年的选举中所说的，国王是否有权要求船舶税并不是争论的问题。无论是否合理，船舶税被感受为一个难以忍受的负担，尤其是因为这项税收的政治必要性未被认可。同样的情况也适用于关于民兵的法令。 休·特雷弗-罗珀提出，总结为“朝廷与乡村”典故的反对倾向，或者说“态度”，应该与十七世纪上半叶在法国和其他地方出现的，作为对王权主张的抵抗的frondiste反对运动相等同。然而，Fronde试图捍卫针对君主权力一般化策略的现有私人统治。在英格兰，另一方面，君主权力的一般化长期以来已确立，即使在查理一世的统治期间，这种一般化的事实也并非批评的对象。被批评的，我在这里故意简化，是王冠所追求的政策的内容，以及高级贵族个别成员从一般化的王权中获得物质利益的方式。 c. 旧制度的部分革命化 离题：英格兰革命作为历史解释之间斗争的对象 这里不是讨论有关英格兰革命的争论的地方。其中一些争论，特别是关于“绅士阶级的崛起”的长期争论，现在可以看作基本解决；其他的仍在继续。它们之所以如此激烈和尖刻，是因为关于1640年、1660年和1688-9年是否发生了革命的争议，如果发生了，它们是否是结构性必然或偶然发生的，是否1640年是一场不仅改变了政治权力组织而且加速了资本主义突破的资产阶级革命——涉及到根本对立的理论原则以及政治取向。这为学术辩论创造了前提条件，在这些前提条件下，只要情绪高涨，每个立场的代表都避免认真考虑对方的观点“就像魔鬼避开圣水一样”。通常需要一代人的更替，才能让那些原本的对手不再将其视为对其特定解释视角基础的罪恶的解释占据主导地位。 在这方面，关于英格兰和法国革命的辩论非常相似。在两次革命的社会结构解释中占主导地位的（部分仍然如此）理论方法假定了跨历史的“社会发展法则”。这一立场在本作中受到彻底批判，与之相关的，对阶级分析的去历史化也受到批判。相反，特别强调旧制度下统治的特定形式对社会关系的发展，因此也对生产和占有的社会形式具有结构性重要性。那么，“政治”就是其他东西，不仅仅是社会关系的表达，而且在个人统治的条件下，个人的行动被赋予了相关的重要性——在某些情况下，甚至对结构变化也具有重要性。"},{"instruction":"请将“On this basis, I also maintain therefore that some of those views put forward with the intention of a devastating criticism of materialist interpretations, are in fact perfectly compatible with these. The same goes for the relation between 'Whigs' and 'revisionists', which I shall come on to below. To take just one example, Conrad Russell's attack on the thesis of a long-term developing crisis of the system of rule is not incompatible with Jack Hexter's or Derek Hirst's emphases on a demonstrable consciousness (in Commons debates) of the freedoms of Englishmen. For, in the context of the actual crisis that did break out, the previous debates show previous conflicts in a particular light. They could also be appealed to as legitimisation for particular - currently motivated - strategies. Controversy over the character of the revolution - this much we can already say by way of generalisation - has been principally waged as a dispute over the preconditions of the revolution. True, the so-called 'revisionists', who insist that the revolution was not due to long-term processes of crisis, but rather arose accidentally, admit that once war had broken out it developed into a struggle over the structures of power, but for both them and their opponents, the concept of a 'bourgeois revolution' stands or falls with the critique of a structural necessity. In the present context we do not need to rehearse once again the old debates as to whether there was a revolution or just a rebellion. A sufficient point of departure here is provided by the so-called 'Whig interpretation', which became decisive for the English national legend. This was seminally advanced in the ten-volume history of England that Samuel R. Gardiner published from 1883 onward.190 In the Whig interpretation of English history, freedom was (and is) understood as a basic human disposition. In the course of the histori-cal process - so this interpretation has it, in its more recent as well as its clas-sical formulations - freedom has increasingly developed, so that it came to determine people's thinking and eventually (or even, consequently) also their action. England is seen as the hearth of freedom, as it is here - from Magna Carta via the revolution of the seventeenth century through to the reforms of the nineteenth - that its progress has been constant. In this model of interpretation, the revolution is seen as a necessary result of the - sharpening - conflicts over questions of constitutional policy that were waged between the crown on one side and the House of Commons on the other. This position, which in a more moderate form is still represented today, has been criticised from two very different angles. The first criticism was by materialist interpretations that proceed from a social-structural necessity of revolution. The second was by the so-called revisionists, who set themselves against both the Whig and the materialist interpretations. In actual fact, there are considerable points of agreement between the Whig and the social-structural interpretations. Both have at their core a notion of progress, and both see (or saw) the gentry as the most important group bearing this historical progress, and as a group that developed in distinction from the (high) nobility. The notions of bourgeois freedom that are central to the Whigs are generally understood by Marxists as correlative to an interest in the breakthrough of capitalism. Finally, the necessity of the revolution in both interpretations is rooted in the structures of the ancien régime. The immediate occasion, and the conduct of particular individuals, is left to historical accident (this is particularly clear in Lawrence Stone).191 The materialist line of argument was developed in three successive stages, starting with R.H. Tawney's thesis of the rise of the gentry. According to Tawney, the gentry were the bearers of new and capitalist forms of production and appropriation. The question for them in the seventeenth century, therefore, was to attain a position in the system of power that matched their material advance. We need not go into the many objections that were made against Tawney, and later against his critics, but simply stress once again that Tawney, though he did not define himself as a Marxist, applied to English history of the sixteenth and early seventeenth century a model of the bourgeois revolution that was taken from Marxism. He made the gentry the bearers of the development of capitalism, and thus at the same time a kind of early bourgeois class. This simplification does not do justice to the differentiations and insights of Tawney's work, but it does sum up its effect. If today, once again, M.L. Bush can describe the gentry as the lesser nobility of England,192 a great deal of water has flowed down the Thames in the meantime. ‘The storm over the gentry', which Jack Hexter unleashed several decades back in an essay that rightly became a classic, held a whole scholarly generation in thrall. The next - and subsequently dominant - version of a materialist interpre-tation was presented by Christopher Hill. His slim volume on The English Revolution 1640193 developed the interpretative model of a ‘bourgeois revo-lution' according to which shifts in power were determined by changes in social structure. By far the most comprehensive part of his discussion bore on the ‘economic' and ‘political' background to the revolution. The small section on the Revolution itself chiefly contained references to structural change. For Hill, the Revolution was a structural necessity, and since its outcome was not in question in his view, the analysis of its course had no further interest. In a certain sense, the third stage of the argument supplemented the two previous ones. In his work on The Crisis of the Aristocracy,194 Lawrence Stone presented the structural preconditions of the revolution as a legitimisation crisis of royal rule. This had come about because the great noble families sought to overcome a crisis in the material reproduction of their rule which had developed from the late sixteenth century, by obtaining lucrative offices and presents from the crown. This in turn necessarily brought the crown into increasing disrepute. The catalysts of the Revolution were accidental for Stone, though he too saw its causes in the long-term changes of social structures. In the meantime, champions of materialist interpretations have been con-vinced in many particulars by the arguments of their opponents. In 1981, Christopher Hill accepted that the debates over the empirical viability of the thesis of the rise of the gentry had proceeded from an ‘ill defined class',195 and in 1985 Lawrence Stone summed up his position: Hill and I are thus now in agreement that the English Revolution was not caused by a clear conflict between feudal and bourgeois ideologies and classes; that the alignment of forces among the rural elites did not correlate with attitudes towards ruthless enclosure; that the Parliamentarian gentry had conscious intention of destroying feudalism; but that the end result, first of the royal defeat and second of the consolidation of the defeat in the Glori-ous Revolution forty years later, was decisive.196 Both Stone and Hill, however - not to mention Brian Manning - stick to the kernel of their respective arguments: Hill to the ‘economic causes' and Stone to the crisis of the aristocracy.197 With George R. Elton, whom the present generation of ‘revisionists' regard as their ancestor, there began the systematic critique of both versions explain-ing the revolution in terms of long-run processes of crisis. Since Elton, as noted above, shifted the most important changes in the direction of a constitutional monarchy back as far as the 1530s, the struggles between the king and Parlia-ment that led to civil war a century later could not in his view have had the kind of major structural significance that was traditionally supposed in the Whig interpretation. Elton's critique of the notion of a ‘High Road to Civil War'198 can be seen as the guiding principle in the research of those historians who have come to be grouped under the general rubric of revisionists. Conrad Russell emphasised the (financial) burdens that war imposed on governments. He pointed out that the cost of war had risen internationally, and proposed to replace the former focus on ‘internal' developments by a greater regard for foreign policy as a factor of crisis.199 This perspective has since gained a great deal of ground. It is necessary to bear in mind, however (as was already objected above in relation to Simon Adams), that these gov-ernment difficulties found expression in particular goals of religious policy. Moreover, Russell himself always stressed that for the early decades of the seventeenth century there was no institutionalised right of participation, so that one should not speak of Parliament in the singular but still of the king's parliaments in the plural. (On this point, which divides Russell from Elton, I am in wholehearted agreement.) The practice of personal rule, which Charles substituted after 1628 for his struggles with parliaments, can thus no longer serve as evidence for a far-reaching crisis of rule. A far more important strand of argument of the ‘revisionists' was directed against the role of the Commons, and consequently against the thesis of a crisis of the aristocracy. Authors such as Paul Christianson (1977) and J.K. Gruenfelder (1977) not only put forward the view that the political role of the House of Lords had long been undervalued, they saw certain peers as the real puppet-masters of the political development that eventually led to war. On occasion, this argument bore surprising fruit. As far back as 1981, Christopher Hill in his memorial lecture for John Neale made fun of Farnell's thesis which explained the presence of many seamen at certain demonstrations by the fact that the Earl of Warwick and young Vane had access to the muster rolls of the vice-admiralty:”翻译为中文","output":"在这个基础上，我因此也认为，一些带着严厉批评唯物主义解释意图提出的观点，实际上与这些解释完全兼容。对于“辉格党人”和“修正主义者”之间的关系，我将在下面讨论，情况也是如此。举个例子，康拉德·罗素对于系统统治长期发展危机论点的攻击，并不与杰克·赫克斯特或德里克·赫斯特强调在下议院辩论中证实的英格兰人自由意识不相容。因为，在实际爆发的危机背景下，之前的辩论以特定的光景展示了早先的冲突。它们也可以作为特定的——当前动机驱动的——策略的合法性依据而被引用。 革命性质的争议——我们可以通过概括来说——主要以革命前提条件的争议进行。诚然，所谓的“修正主义者”坚称革命不是由长期危机进程引起的，而是偶然发生的，但他们承认，一旦战争爆发，它就演变成了对权力结构的斗争，但对他们和他们的对手来说，“资产阶级革命”的概念成败与对结构性必要性的批评关系密切。 在目前的背景下，我们不需要再次重复是否存在革命或仅是叛乱的旧辩论。所谓的“辉格党解释”，为英格兰国家传说定下了决定性的基调，为我们提供了足够的出发点。萨缪尔·R·加德纳从1883年开始出版的英格兰十卷本历史深刻地提出了这一解释。在辉格党对英格兰历史的解释中，自由被理解为一种基本的人类倾向。根据这种解释，无论是在更近期还是在经典阐述中，自由不断发展，以至于最终决定了人们的思想（甚至还有他们的行动）。英格兰被视为自由的炉灶，因为正是在这里——从《大宪章》、通过17世纪的革命，到19世纪的改革——其进步一直是持续的。 在这种解释模型中，革命被视为王室一方与下议院另一方就宪法政策问题进行的——日益尖锐的——冲突的必然结果。这一立场，以一种更温和的形式，今天仍然有代表。这一立场从两个非常不同的角度受到了批评。 第一个批评来自从社会结构性革命必然性出发的唯物主义解释。第二个批评来自所谓的修正主义者，他们反对辉格党和唯物主义解释。 实际上，辉格党解释和社会结构解释之间有相当多的一致点。两者都以进步观念为核心，都认为（或认为）绅士是承担这一历史进步的最重要群体，并且是与（高级）贵族区别开来的群体。辉格党中心的资产阶级自由观念，通常被马克思主义者理解为与资本主义突破的利益相关。最后，两种解释中的革命必要性都植根于旧制度的结构中。具体个体的行为和直接起因留给历史偶然性（这在劳伦斯·斯通中特别清楚）。 唯物论的论证发展了三个连续的阶段，从R.H. 塔尼关于绅士崛起的论文开始。据塔尼称，绅士是新的和资本主义生产和占有方式的承载者。因此，对他们来说，17世纪的问题是获得与他们物质进步相匹配的权力体系地位。我们不需要详细讨论对塔尼的众多反对意见，以及后来对他的批评者的反对，但仍需再次强调，尽管塔尼没有将自己定义为马克思主义者，他还是将马克思主义中的资产阶级革命模型应用到了16世纪和17世纪早期的英格兰历史上。他使绅士成为资本主义发展的承载者，从而同时成为一种早期的资产阶级。这种简化并不公正地对待塔尼作品中的差异化和洞见，但它确实总结了其影响。如果今天，M.L. Bush再次将绅士描述为英格兰的小贵族，那么与此同时，泰晤士河已经流淌了很多水。几十年前，杰克·赫克斯特在一篇理所当然成为经典的文章中发起了对“绅士风暴”的研究，吸引了整整一代学者的关注。 接下来，克里斯托弗·希尔提出了后来占主导地位的唯物主义解释的版本。他的著作《英格兰革命1640》发展了“资产阶级革命”的解释模型，根据这个模型，权力的转移由社会结构的变化决定。希尔讨论的最广泛部分涉及革命的“经济”和“政治”背景。革命本身的小部分主要包含了对结构性变化的引用。对希尔来说，革命是一种结构性必要性，因为在他看来其结果是毫无疑问的，因此对其过程的分析没有进一步的兴趣。 从某种意义上说，第三阶段的论证补充了前两个阶段。在他的作品《贵族危机》中，劳伦斯·斯通将革命的结构性前提条件呈现为王室统治的合法性危机。这是因为，从16世纪末开始，大贵族家族试图通过获得来自王室的有利职位和赠予来克服其统治的物质再生产危机。这反过来必然使王室的声誉日益下滑。对斯通来说，革命的催化剂是偶然的，尽管他也认为其原因在于社会结构的长期变化。 与此同时，唯物主义解释的拥护者在许多细节上被对手的论点所说服。1981年，克里斯托弗·希尔接受了关于绅士崛起论文的实证可行性辩论是基于一个“定义不清的阶级”的观点，1985年，劳伦斯·斯通总结了他的立场： 希尔和我现在一致认为，英格兰革命不是由封建和资产阶级意识形态及阶级之间的明确冲突引起的；在农村精英之间的力量排列与对无情圈地的态度无关；议会派绅士有意图摧毁封建制度；但是，第一次皇家失败的最终结果，以及四十年后光荣革命的巩固，是决定性的。 然而，不用说布莱恩·曼宁，斯通和希尔仍然坚持他们各自论点的核心：希尔坚持“经济原因”，斯通坚持贵族危机。 乔治·R·埃尔顿，现代“修正主义者”将其视为鼻祖，开始了对两种解释革命的长期危机过程版本的系统性批评。正如上文所述，埃尔顿将最重要的变化——朝向君主立宪制的变化——追溯到1530年代，因此在他看来，一个世纪后导致内战的国王与议会之间的斗争不可能具有辉格党解释中传统假设的那种重大结构性意义。埃尔顿对“通往内战之路”的高度批评可以被视为总体上被归类为修正主义者的历史学家研究的指导原则。 康拉德·罗素强调战争对政府施加的（财政）负担。他指出，战争成本在国际上有所上升，并提议将原来关注“内部”发展的焦点转移到将外交政策作为危机因素的更大重视上。这一视角自此获得了很大的发展。然而，需要记住的是（如上文针对西蒙·亚当斯的反对意见所指出的），这些政府的困难在特定的宗教政策目标中找到了表达。 此外，罗素本人一直强调，对于17世纪早期几十年，并不存在制度化的参与权利，所以不应该将议会视为单数，而应该是复数形式的国王议会。（在这一点上，我完全同意罗素，他与埃尔顿有所分歧。）查理在1628年之后用个人统治取代了与议会的斗争，因此不再能作为统治危机深远的证据。 “修正主义者”的一个更重要的论点是针对下议院的角色，因此反对贵族危机论。如保罗·克里斯蒂安森（1977年）和J.K. 格鲁恩费尔德（1977年）等作者不仅提出了下议院的政治角色长期以来被低估的观点，他们还将某些贵族视为最终导致战争的政治发展的真正操纵者。这一论点偶尔会产生令人惊讶的成果。早在1981年，克里斯托弗·希尔在纪念约翰·尼尔的演讲中就嘲笑了法尼尔的论点，法尼尔解释某些示威活动中存在许多海员的现象，是因为沃里克伯爵和年轻的范恩可以获得海军上将的点名册："},{"instruction":"请将“We can visualise the scene.

Send one of our client M.P.s along to order him to report for demonstration at 7.0 a.m. tomorrow”.200 The ‘revisionist' interpretation reduced politics to a struggle for positions. The exclusive material for historians, in their conception, should be actual behaviour, rather than the fine language by which the Whig historians let themselves be blinded. It was pointed out on many occasions (most recently by J.C.D. Clark),201 that these analyses were evidently influenced by an inter-pretative model that had for a while dominated research into the eighteenth century. Lewis Namier had analysed politics in the reign of George III as the result of a competition for positions (and money), and ultimately as an accidental result of connections and intrigues between cliques of nobles. While the so-called Namier model had in the meantime lost its persuasiveness among historians who specialised in the analysis of eighteenth-century English society, it celebrated a happy return in the historiography of the early seventeenth century. Detailed analysis of government policy was extremely fruitful in so far as it led to criticism of over-generous postulates of structural necessity, and res-ervations about the heroic epic of the untiring champions of the ‘freedom of Englishmen'. Its limitations lay in the application of an unhistorical model of politics. For even convincing criticism of the much favoured idea of a steadily sharpening constitutional conflict between crown and Parliament - from the apology of 1604 (by which Parliament informed James I of the conditions for the exercise of his rule, in particular regarding the granting of privileges), via the Parliament of 1628 to the events of 1640 - does not contradict the fact that the published arguments of the earlier parliaments only made an appearance in the political discourse of later conflicts to the extent that they encouraged, or at any rate introduced, certain perspectives, once the conflict was under way. But, as we have already said, this means that Russell and Hexter are both right. In this connection, the broadening of the literary public in the - numerically increased - ranks of the gentry is also significant.202 This changed the preconditions for the possible effects of political conflict. The same goes for a whole series of the changes that Lawrence Stone notes in relation to the ruling practice of the great nobles. Even if the thesis of a structural crisis of noble rule cannot be upheld, changes in the basis and prac-tice of this rule must still be taken into consideration. The ‘end of rebellions', these being understood as the organisation of private armed force against the king, signalled a fundamental change in the strategies of the nobles. This change, however, was a structural precondition for the possibility of a civil war in which the king and his supporters were challenged by a public armed force organised by Parliament. The ‘revisionists' - and under this rubric we can include authors whose arguments otherwise differ greatly - confronted the previously dominant interpretations of the English Revolution with the results of painstaking archival research. But this did not amount to a 'revision' of former interpreta-tive models. What was required for this was the development of an explana-tory approach of their own. Even those who follow the revisionists to a great extent in seeing the outbreak of revolution as not in itself necessary, may seek in their works in vain for an explanation of the fact that this outbreak was none the less possible, and that the conflict, once under way, led on to an assault on estate rule. Questions of this kind must be simply overlooked by the Namier model of explanation, as it brackets out structural preconditions for the effect of politics. In the last two decades, historiography of the English Revolution has focussed significantly on regional and local research. As for other historical eras, works of this kind deal a blow to long-held ideas also in this field, and provide new insights into actual functioning of rule. One of the earliest local studies on the history of the English Revolution was at the same time one of the most provocative. In 1966, Alan Everitt in his analysis of conditions in Kent during the revolutionary era put forward the view that it was not yet possible to speak of 'England' in the seventeenth cen-tury. Social conditions were too varied, and political developments were not explicable in terms of generalised interests and problems, but only of particu-lar local conditions. What came to be described as the 'Everitt model' of inter-pretation performed the service of questioning the general significance of the political struggles pursued at Westminster. (But, if the relevance of constitu-tional conflicts for the outcome of elections to the 1640 Parliament is rejected, that does away not just with the Whig thesis of a long-run constitutional crisis, but also with the assumption of a legitimacy crisis of the crown.) The Everitt model abandons the question of how it could none the less happen that 'the kingdom' eventually found itself at war. For this to be the case, there had to be a certain practical generalisation of the exercise of monarchical rule, whatever its limitations (which in the present work I have repeatedly stressed). More recent works, such as those of Anthony Fletcher and John Morrill, though they have stressed that the population in many places and regions were concerned at first to keep out of the struggle, and that the decision for one side or the other was made according to local conditions or sometimes simply because one side was quicker to demand arms and money (cf. below), have not ruled out influences of a wider nature. Underdown, however, sees in the developments of a practice of rule ('popular politics') that was in some regions very advanced, one of the most important preconditions for political allegiance. Where, as especially in agricultural regions, the traditional forms of paternalist rule and popular culture had persisted, there was in Underdown's view a tendency towards royalism, and where these old forms of ruling practice and popular culture had broken down as a result of social polarisation and Puritanical ruling practice, there conversely developed in his view attitudes rather more friendly to Parliament. In so far as the orientations of the nobility held sway, Underdown attributes this to the persistence of the social basis of traditional ‘deference'.203 Underdown's local research is the most recent attempt at a materialist interpretation of (important elements of) the history of the revolution. My own interpretation very largely coincides with the structural-analytical arguments of David Harris Sacks.204 The ‘localism' that he sees simply as a research mentality is, according to Sacks, an attempt to dispose of the rel-evance of both the Whig interpretation and materialist conceptions by con-testing the national context of the conflicts. Sacks emphasises against this that a connection between local structures and ‘central authorities' was always present in local conflicts. One of the key problems of the era, in his view, was the change in this connection.205 To put it another way, he posits the structural possibility of a difference between generalised and centralised monarchical power, which only came into being when the generalised rule of the crown was established, whilst local control of the exercise of this rule was simultane-ously broadened and stabilised. In connection with these developments, insis-tence on local autonomy was still a position in relation to generalised rule. If, as the ‘revisionists' stressed, Englishmen (and certainly Englishwomen) were not concerned with matters outside their own county, this was not just due to tradition, but also to politics. c. 1. The English Revolution as event and structural change In the English Revolution, the monarchy, the House of Lords and the rule of the bishops were all done away with, and a republic established. The most important privileges of the great nobles were abolished, and estate possession of the local exercise of generalised rule was considerably restricted. Wealth and unequal possession of land were criticised, and even the authority of husbands over their wives. A few people also saw the doctrine of sin as no longer beyond challenge. In 1660, the monarchy, the House of Lords and the rule of the bishops were restored. The king no longer enjoyed a fiscal power derived from feudal tenures, nor did he have prerogative courts, but the personal elements of his rule were only slightly curtailed. In the late seventeenth century, the House of Lords was if anything more powerful than it had been in the time before the Revolution, and in the counties the county gentry put a decisive stop to the rule of the 'new men'. Rule over men and the security of private property were not lastingly undermined, any more than belief in sin. The structure of power was not revolutionised by the conflicts of the mid-seventeenth century. Yet very much more was at issue in these conflicts than just a structurally incidental departure from the 'normal course' of English political history. In two respects in particular, the struggles of the revolutionary years had a lasting effect: they changed the conditions of practice for both religious and estate rule. The 'Puritan revolution' destroyed the basis for political strategies that sought to constrain society to the commands of the 'Saints' by way of gener-alised power. Along with this disappeared the basis for strategies that aimed to impose political unity and social stability by way of religious unity. The years of revolution saw the emergence of the political preconditions for the privatising of religion. The Church of England became - for clarity's sake, I exaggerate this tendency - an instance for the legitimisation of socio-political goals. Religious discourse in England retained its prominence in political conflicts until the very end of the ancien régime, a point I shall return to several times below. But after the brief attempt to impose a social order pleasing to God, the relation between politics and religion was fundamentally changed.”翻译为中文","output":"我们可以想象这一幕。沃里克和范恩深夜悄悄溜进海军部，翻阅名册，然后说：“哈：水手乔·布洛格斯，137英里尽头路。派我们的一名客户议员去命令他明天早上7点报到示威。”修正主义者的解释将政治简化为对职位的争夺。在他们的观念中，历史学家的独有材料应该是实际行为，而不是辉格党历史学家被蒙蔽的优美语言。多次指出（最近由J.C.D. 克拉克提出），这些分析显然受到了一度主导18世纪研究的解释模型的影响。刘易斯·纳米尔曾分析乔治三世统治时期的政治是职位（和金钱）竞争的结果，最终是贵族派系之间的联系和阴谋的偶然结果。尽管所谓的纳米尔模型在此期间已经失去了分析18世纪英格兰社会的历史学家们的说服力，但在早期17世纪的史学中却欢欣鼓舞地回归。 详细分析政府政策极富成果，因为它导致了对结构性必要性过分假设的批评，以及对为“英格兰人自由”不懈奋斗的英雄史诗的保留。其局限性在于应用了一种非历史性的政治模型。因为，即使对皇冠与议会之间逐渐加剧的宪法冲突这一备受青睐的观点的有力批评——从1604年的辩解（议会向詹姆斯一世通报行使其统治的条件，特别是关于特权的授予）经过1628年的议会到1640年的事件——并不否认早期议会的已发表论点在后来的冲突政治话语中只有在它们鼓励或至少引入某些观点后才出现的事实。但是，正如我们已经说过的，这意味着罗素和赫克斯特都是正确的。在这方面，绅士阶层中文学大众的扩大——数量上的增加——也很重要。这改变了政治冲突可能效果的前提条件。 劳伦斯·斯通所指出的与大贵族统治实践相关的一系列变化也是如此。即使不能维持贵族统治结构性危机的论点，仍需考虑这种统治的基础和实践的变化。所谓“叛乱的终结”，被理解为对抗国王组织私人武装力量的行为，标志着贵族策略的根本变化。然而，这种变化是内战可能性的结构性前提，国王及其支持者被议会组织的公共武装力量所挑战。 修正主义者——在这个标题下，我们可以包括那些论点否则大相径庭的作者——用经过艰苦的档案研究成果挑战了先前主导的英格兰革命解释。但这并不等于对先前解释模型的“修正”。需要的是发展他们自己的解释方法。即使那些在很大程度上追随修正主义者，认为革命的爆发本身并不是必然的，也可能徒劳地在他们的作品中寻求解释，即这种爆发为什么尽管如此是可能的，以及一旦冲突开始，为什么会导致对贵族统治的攻击。这种问题必须被纳米尔解释模型所忽视，因为它排除了政治效果的结构性前提。 在过去的二十年中，英格兰革命的史学研究显著地集中于地区和本地研究。对于其他历史时期一样，这种研究也对这个领域长期持有的观念进行了冲击，并提供了有关统治实际运作的新见解。 最早期的关于英格兰革命历史的本地研究之一，同时也是最具挑战性的。1966年，艾伦·埃弗里特在分析革命时期肯特郡的情况时提出，17世纪还不可能谈论“英格兰”。社会条件太过多样，政治发展无法用一般化的利益和问题来解释，而只能用特定的地方条件来解释。被称为“埃弗里特模型”的解释质疑了在威斯敏斯特进行的政治斗争的一般意义。（但是，如果拒绝承认宪法冲突对1640年议会选举结果的相关性，那不仅消除了关于长期宪法危机的辉格党论点，也消除了关于王冠合法性危机的假设。）埃弗里特模型放弃了探究“王国”最终如何发现自己陷入战争的问题。要达到这个情况，必须存在君主统治行使的某种实际一般化，无论其限制如何（我在本作中反复强调了这一点）。 更近期的作品，如安东尼·弗莱彻和约翰·莫里尔的作品，尽管强调人们在许多地方和地区起初努力保持远离斗争，而且支持一方或另一方的决定是根据地方条件作出的，有时仅仅是因为一方更快地要求武器和金钱（参见下文），但并未排除更广泛影响的存在。然而，安德唐认为，在某些地区实践的统治（“大众政治”）非常先进，是政治忠诚的最重要前提之一。在他看来，特别是在农业地区，传统的家长式统治和大众文化得以持续的地方，倾向于保王党，而在这些旧的统治实践和大众文化由于社会两极分化和清教徒统治实践破裂的地方，反而发展出更加亲近议会的态度。在贵族的取向占据主导地位的地方，安德唐将这归因于传统“顺从”的社会基础的持续。安德唐的本地研究是对（重要元素的）革命历史进行唯物解释的最新尝试。 我的解释与大卫·哈里斯·萨克斯的结构分析论点非常一致。萨克斯所认为的仅仅是一种研究心态的“地方主义”，试图通过质疑冲突的国家背景，消除辉格党解释和唯物主义概念的相关性。萨克斯反对这一点，强调地方冲突始终存在于地方结构与“中央当局”的联系中。在他看来，那个时代的一个关键问题是这种联系的变化。换句话说，他提出了一般化和中央集权君主权力之间的结构性差异的可能性，这种差异只有在建立了王室的一般化统治的同时，地方对这一统治行使的控制得到同时扩大和稳定时才会出现。关于这些发展，对地方自治的坚持仍然是对一般化统治的立场。如果修正主义者强调，英格兰人（当然还有英格兰女性）不关心本县以外的事务，这不仅仅是因为传统，也是因为政治。 c. 英格兰革命作为事件和结构性变化 在英格兰革命中，君主制、上议院和主教统治都被废除，建立了共和国。大贵族的最重要特权被废除，地方行使一般化统治的贵族占有权被大大限制。财富和土地的不平等占有受到批评，甚至丈夫对妻子的权威也是如此。少数人也认为罪恶观念不再是不可质疑的。 1660年，君主制、上议院和主教统治得到恢复。国王不再享有来自封建土地的财政权力，也没有了特权法庭，但他的个人统治元素只被稍微限制。 在17世纪晚期，上议院的权力如果不是比革命前更强大的话，也差不多了，在郡县中，县级绅士决定性地制止了“新人”的统治。对人的统治和私有财产的安全并没有被长期破坏，对罪恶的信仰也是如此。 中世纪权力结构并未因17世纪中叶的冲突而革命化。然而，这些冲突涉及的远不止于英格兰政治历史的“正常进程”中偶然的偏离。 特别是在两个方面，革命年代的斗争产生了持久的影响：它们改变了宗教和贵族统治实践的条件。 “清教徒革命”摧毁了政治策略的基础，这些策略旨在通过一般化的权力限制社会服从“圣徒”的命令。随之消失的还有旨在通过宗教统一实现政治统一和社会稳定的策略基础。革命年代见证了宗教私人化的政治前提条件的出现。英格兰教会成为——为了清晰起见，我夸大了这一趋势——合法化社会政治目标的一个实例。在英格兰，宗教话语在古代制度结束时在政治冲突中保持了其突出地位，这是我将在下文多次返回的一点。但在试图强加一个讨上帝喜欢的社会秩序的短暂尝试之后，政治与宗教之间的关系发生了根本改变。"},{"instruction":"请将“The Revolution also changed the preconditions for estate possession of the local exercise of generalised power. For everywhere - even where at the beginning or after years of war the attempt was made to assert local neutrality in relation to the political conflicts - local public spheres were politicised to a previously unknown extent. As far back as the 1530s, there had been a gener-alised public sphere in England. It arose in connection with the Reformation, and the early generalisation of religious discourse is a structural feature of the ancien régime in England. That this was not simply a literary phenomenon is shown by the diffusion across the land of the 'papist' stereotype. The years of revolution saw the establishment of new stereotypes. There was still talk of 'papists', but many who were formerly insulted simply as scoundrels were now referred to as Roundheads or Cavaliers. This shift in language was not incidental to the practice of local rule, but marked a shift in the local public sphere. This had already come to form a terrain - for the sake of clarity, I exaggerate also in this case - on which local hierarchies and the place of each individual within the hierarchy was open to debate. This local public now developed in such a way that different conceptions of religion and government could also be proposed, more clearly than ever before. To sum this up formulaically: in the years of revolution, the local public sphere was consti-tuted as a political public, even where the 'old order' was defended against encroachment and attack. As against these two structural changes, both of which we shall examine below in more detail, the immediate effects of the Revolution on the organi-sation of production and the structures of appropriation remained compara-tively slight. There was not even a fundamental transformation of economic policy. The restriction of the personal power of the king, moreover, did not extend to ensuring the coincidence of centralised and generalised monarchical power. Yet this was still very definitely a revolution, as I will go on to explain. It affected the preconditions for the exercise of personal rule, and in this measure also the basic structures of the ancien régime. The argument that follows will not go into the course of the conflicts and their immediate social and religious-political contents. Our presentation will be confined to those social conditions, and conditions of rule, that decisively structured the struggle for possession of the means of power - and this only by way of selecting specific examples. This struggle was determined by the intentions and actions of many indi-vidual men. On the basis of their social position, their religious and secular education, their experiences and their expectations, they arrived at specific desires, plans and actions. In the course of the struggle many of them changed their views, either because they had the courage to expect and demand more far-reaching changes than they had previously thought possible, or else because they came to the view that the correction of one evil would only con-jure up new and far more threatening dangers. Faced with the further radical-isation of soldiers and the population, they saw a return to the old order with all the failings they had initially combated as the most desirable solution. For many developments, the behaviour of individuals was of particular impor-tance. The effect of these, however, was determined by the views people held of the right order (either the traditional one or the new order they aspired to), by their fear for the maintenance of property and rule or their hope for a better world, but above all by their opportunity to possess the means of power. It is this last aspect in particular that the following structural-analytical argument will focus on. The struggle to reform monarchical rule The outbreak of the English Revolution was provoked by the Scottish nobles, who in 1637 refused to accept the prayer book that Charles I had authorised for Scotland. (The crown had to a degree also provoked their opposition by the reclamation of former church lands.) In February 1638, a good third of the local clergy and more than a third of the Scottish nobles bound themselves in a covenant with God to defend the proper faith. The secular head of the Scottish church saw this as rebellion. It had to be met with force in order to defend the unity of the church and the religious rule of the king. The king thus turned a movement of opposition against the episcopal church into a rebellion against himself.206 Charles I governed at this time without Parliament, and commanded the English nobles to assemble for war along with other soldiers. At the same time the crown ordered individual militia units to prepare for the campaign. This last measure not only contradicted the rule that militias should only be used for local defence, but was also especially risky in political terms, since there was a widespread fear in the country of a ‘papist plot' (possibly with the king's blessing) linked with a Spanish invasion. Nonetheless, the army did assemble, although more than half the members of the gentry who had been summoned sent their apologies, and in many places the Justices of the Peace, sheriffs and deputy lieutenants met with con-siderably difficulty in enforcing the king's orders. The City of London also refused the crown a credit that had been demanded, so that the king was forced back almost entirely on ‘loans' from courtiers and officials that were to a large extent compulsory. The English crown thus had difficulties in wielding prerogative power, though for the moment this was not systematically challenged. The campaign, however, already created conditions for the intensification of the government crisis. On their way north, soldiers destroyed symbols of the politically com-manded faith, and many also joined local uprisings against enclosures. It was the crown itself that had created the organisational preconditions for these public demonstrations of criticism of the aim of the war and the policy of the lords, and the campaign also produced an assembly of members of the nobility such as had not taken place for a decade - since the king had dispensed with the advice of Parliament. In other words, while the king had managed to enlist the services of local representatives of his rule for his war against Scotland, along with a further and considerable part of the nobility, this did not mean he could use these armed subjects of all ranks simply as an instrument of royal prerogative. The preparations for the war, which contemporaries described as a ‘bishops' war', led to a generalisation of the criticism of the king's practice of rule, since it made known to the participants the wide extent of this criticism. The ‘bishops' war' did not yet face the English king with a revolutionary situation, but it created the conditions for this to develop. Military defeat forced the king to make peace with the Scots. In preparation for a new and more successful campaign, he was forced early in 1640 to summon Parliament. He treated Parliament, however, with consummate folly. Instead of justifying and defending his war aims, the king only asked for money, and although - as recent research has shown - this parliament was in no way fundamentally opposed to him at this time, and the crown could still count in particular on the support of the House of Lords, the king was himself faced with so many petitions from the counties explicitly demanding the ‘abo-lition of abuses' that he dismissed the ‘Short Parliament' after three weeks. In November 1640 a new parliament assembled. (Since it was not formally dissolved until 16 March 1660, this is known as the ‘Long Parliament'.) The election of members to the House of Commons was partly contested, but this did not yet make this Parliament into an oppositional assembly. In the political conditions of 1640, however, the composition of Parliament - which D. Brunton and D.H. Pennington have researched207 - was less decisive than it would have been at other times. For the policy of 'thorough', as the strategies pursued by the king and his Council for the practical implementation of gov-ernment decrees were described, and subsequently above all the war whose aim many did not share, had led to the rise of a public that sought to make Parliament its mouthpiece. Petitions with hundreds and often thousands of signatures arrived both from London and other parts of the country. Up until then, the Council had sought to dismiss mass petitions of this kind as rebellion.208 Groups of Lon-doners, also joined by arrivals from elsewhere, delivered their petitions in person. This amounted in some cases to demonstrations, and at least in one case to armed clashes with the Guard, whom the king had deployed outside Parliament. Demonstrations of this kind were in some cases called by (London) Members of Parliament and priests. But since these demonstrations generally involved the better-off classes, or at least not the very poor,209 we have to assume that both sides were convinced of the usefulness of this mass presence. The censorship that had previously been practised against publications critical of the church broke down in practice in autumn 1640. It was formally ended with the abolition of the court of Star Chamber.210 The number of ser-mons and agitational addresses that were not only delivered verbally but also published grew rapidly. Many members who took their place in Parliament, many clerics who had for years been regulated and in cases also persecuted, and not least many of the faithful across the country, saw in the summoning of Parliament the opportunity for reform of the church. For them, freedom of the press and free-dom of speech were seen as especially serving this goal. They saw the reform of the church as leading to the abolition of other abuses. For in a secular order pleasing to God, there would automatically be what we would nowadays call a fundamental moralising of public and private life, so that many evils would be done away with, above all the feared danger of papism. They preached untiringly that redemption would rest on faith, and that this would be made manifest in deeds. And since Parliament was itself prepared to attack its tasks with prayers and fasts - the very first decision of the Long Parliament was to proclaim 17 November as a fast day for its members - it could appear right away that Parliament was the proper instance to realise a programme of this kind. All the more so, when it was decided to hold debates on abuse in the church one day each week.211 In December, however, the House of Lords declared that no other religion than that officially established was to be tolerated. This led to a petition being brought to Parliament signed by 30,000 Londoners. As had already happened previously with the so-called ‘Root and Branch' petition, this called for the rule of the bishops to be abolished. In a departure from former legal practice, the petitions of winter 1640-1 were sent directly to Parliament without the consent of the City of London.212 Mass petitioners of this kind were not completely spontaneous,213 but the number of petioners was impressive.”翻译为中文","output":"革命还改变了地方行使普遍权力的贵族占有的前提条件。因为无论在哪里——即使在战争开始或多年后试图主张与政治冲突无关的地方中立的地方，当地公共领域都在前所未有的程度上被政治化了。早在1530年代，英格兰就出现了一个普遍的公共领域。它与宗教改革有关，并且早期宗教话语的普遍化是英格兰旧制度的一个结构特征。这不仅仅是一个文学现象，通过遍布全国的“天主教徒”刻板印象的传播可以看出。革命年代确立了新的刻板印象。“教徒”的说法仍然存在，但许多以前仅仅被简单地侮辱为恶棍的人现在被称为圆头党或骑士党。语言的转变不是地方统治实践的附属品，而是标志着地方公共领域的转变。这已经形成了一个领域——为了清晰起见，我在这里也夸大其词——在这个领域上，地方等级和每个个体在等级中的位置开放讨论。这个地方公共领域现在以这样一种方式发展，以前所未有的清晰度提出了关于宗教和政府的不同概念。总结一下：在革命年代，地方公共领域作为一个政治公共领域被构建，即使是在“旧秩序”受到侵犯和攻击时也是如此。 与这两个结构性变化相对立，我们将在下文中更详细地检查这两个变化，革命对生产组织和占有结构的直接影响相对较小。甚至连经济政策也没有发生根本变革。此外，国王的个人权力的限制并未延伸到确保中央集权和普遍君主权力的一致。然而，这仍然是一次革命，正如我将继续解释的那样。它影响了个人统治行使的前提条件，并在这个范围内也影响了旧制度的基本结构。 以下的论述将不涉及冲突的过程及其直接的社会和宗教政治内容。我们的陈述将局限于决定性地构建争夺权力手段斗争的社会条件和统治条件——并且仅通过选择特定的例子来进行。 这场斗争是由许多个体男性的意图和行动决定的。基于他们的社会地位、宗教和世俗教育、经历和期望，他们形成了特定的愿望、计划和行动。在斗争过程中，他们中的许多人改变了观点，要么是因为他们有勇气期待和要求比以前认为可能的更深远的变化，要么是因为他们认为，纠正一个弊端只会招致新的、更加威胁性的危险。面对军队和民众进一步激进化，他们认为回归最初抗争过的不完善的旧秩序是最理想的解决方案。对于许多发展来说，个体的行为特别重要。然而，这些行为的效果是由人们对正确秩序（无论是传统的还是他们渴望的新秩序）的看法、对维护财产和统治的担忧或对更美好世界的希望决定的，但最重要的是他们拥有权力手段的机会。这最后一个方面尤其是以下结构分析论证的关注焦点。 改革君主制的斗争 英格兰革命的爆发是由苏格兰贵族在1637年拒绝接受查理一世为苏格兰授权的祈祷书引发的。（国王在一定程度上也通过收回前教会土地激起了他们的反对。） 1638年2月，相当一部分地方神职人员和超过三分之一的苏格兰贵族在与上帝的盟约中承诺捍卫正确的信仰。苏格兰教会的世俗领袖将此视为叛乱。必须动用武力来捍卫教会的统一和国王的宗教统治。国王因此将反对主教教会的反对运动变成了反对自己的叛乱。 当时的查理一世在没有议会的情况下统治，并命令英格兰贵族随其他士兵一起集结准备战争。与此同时，国王命令个别民兵单位准备参加战役。这最后一项措施不仅违背了民兵仅应用于地方防御的规则，而且在政治上也特别冒险，因为国内普遍担心一个可能得到国王祝福的“天主教阴谋”与西班牙入侵有关。 尽管如此，军队还是集结起来，尽管被召集的绅士中有一半以上道歉未能到来，在许多地方，地方治安官、警长和副军官在执行国王命令时遇到了相当的困难。伦敦市也拒绝了国王要求的信贷，使国王几乎完全依赖于从朝臣和官员那里以很大程度上是强制性的“贷款”。 因此，英格兰王室在行使特权权力方面遇到了困难，尽管目前这还没有受到系统性的挑战。然而，这次战役已经为政府危机的加剧创造了条件。 在北上途中，士兵摧毁了政治指令性信仰的象征，并且许多人也加入了当地反对圈地运动的起义。是国王自己为这些公开批评战争目标和领主政策的公开示威创造了组织前提条件，这次战役还产生了一次像过去十年（自从国王停止征求议会意见以来）未曾发生的贵族集会。换句话说，虽然国王设法动员了地方代表和进一步相当部分的贵族为对抗苏格兰的战争提供服务，但这并不意味着他可以将这些来自各个等级的武装臣民仅仅作为王室特权的工具。这场被当时人描述为“主教战争”的战争准备工作导致了对国王统治实践的批评的普遍化，因为它让参与者了解到这种批评的广泛程度。“主教战争”没有让英格兰国王面对革命形势，但它创造了这种形势发展的条件。 军事失败迫使国王与苏格兰达成和平。为了准备一次新的、更成功的战役，他于1640年初被迫召集议会。然而，他极其愚蠢地对待议会。他没有为他的战争目标辩护和辩解，而只是要求资金，尽管最近的研究表明，当时这个议会并非完全反对他，王室尤其还可以指望上议院的支持，但国王本人面对来自郡县明确要求“废除滥用”的许多请愿书，他在三周后解散了“短议会”。 1640年11月，一届新议会召开。（由于直到1660年3月16日才正式解散，因此被称为“长议会”。）下议院议员的选举部分受到了争议，但这还没有使这个议会变成一个反对派议会。然而，在1640年的政治环境下，议会的组成——D. 布伦顿和D.H. 彭宁顿已经研究过——比在其他时期的决定性就要小得多了。因为国王和他的议会所追求的“彻底”策略，以及随后特别是许多人不分享其目标的战争，导致了一个寻求将议会作为其代言人的公众的崛起。 来自伦敦和国家其他地区的带有数百甚至数千个签名的请愿书纷至沓来。直到那时，议会一直试图将此类大规模请愿书视为叛乱加以驳回。一些伦敦人加入了从其他地方来的人一起亲自递交他们的请愿书。这在某些情况下相当于示威，在至少一种情况下与国王在议会外部署的卫队发生了武装冲突。此类示威在某些情况下是由（伦敦）议会议员和牧师召集的。但由于这些示威通常涉及较富裕的阶层，或至少不是非常贫穷的人，我们必须认为双方都相信这种大规模出现的有用性。 1640年秋天，实际上已经对批评教会的出版物实施的审查制度崩溃。它随着星室法庭的废除而正式结束。批评讲道和煽动性演讲的数量迅速增长，这些不仅仅是口头传达，也被出版。 许多上任的议员，多年来受到监管甚至在某些情况下被迫害的许多神职人员，以及全国不少忠诚的人，都在议会的召集中看到了改革教会的机会。对他们来说，出版自由和言论自由被视为特别服务于这一目标。他们认为教会的改革将导致其他滥用的废除。因为在一个讨上帝喜欢的世俗秩序中，自动就会有我们今天所说的公共和私人生活的根本道德化，从而许多弊端将被消除，尤其是最令人担忧的教皇主义危险。他们不知疲倦地宣讲，救赎将依靠信仰，并通过行为显现出来。由于议会自己准备用祈祷和禁食来应对其任务——“长议会”的第一个决定就是宣布11月17日为其成员的禁食日——它立即显得议会是实现这类计划的适当机构。尤其是当决定每周有一天就教会的滥用进行辩论时更是如此。 然而，12月，上议院宣布不容忍除官方确立的宗教之外的其他宗教。这导致一份由3万名伦敦人签名的请愿书被送交议会。就像之前所谓的“根与枝”请愿书一样，这也要求废除主教的统治。与过去的法律实践不同，1640-1年冬季的请愿书未经伦敦市同意直接发送给议会。此类大规模请愿者并非完全自发，但请愿者的数量令人印象深刻。"},{"instruction":"请将“The first structural condition for the emergence and effectiveness of political decisions that we should bear in mind in considering the events of the years following 1640, is this public debate on the church (only sketched here in outline), which sought to make Parliament the instrument of a church reform that was desired from below but would be carried out from above. It was against the background of this public sphere that Parliament made its decisions, and by it that these were judged. The Members of Parliament, on the other hand, sought to use the public as an instrument of their own policy. This was also true, moreover, for the upholders of episcopal rule. Some of those who wished to reform the kingdom at this time particularly focused on the abolition of arbitrary taxation, others on the freedom to preach. For most of them, it was indeed a question of rights, liberties and privileges. The Members of Parliament certainly saw themselves as representatives of the kingdom and thus also of the public sphere that had now arisen, but this did not make the Lords ready to abandon the claim - with possible individual exceptions - to interpret which demands were useful to the realm. If today's 'revisionist' historians maintain that many peers sought to lead the masses,214 what they focus on is actually the claim to a power of interpreting the content of public debates. Realisation of this claim, however, was not achievable. For right from the start, the decisions of Parliament also assumed a debate on the permissible status of the public sphere, i.e. the right to put Parliament - and also the City of London council - under pressure by mass petitions and demonstrations. Attempts by Parliament to instrumentalise the public for its own ends were countered by opposite attempts to make Parliament an instrument of the public sphere, the 'agent' of popular will, as the 'Grand Remonstrance' some years later was to demand.215 The fact that a power-stabilising outcome to the political contradictions thereby constituted did not seem automatically assured, is shown by the many warnings of pos-sible radicalisation of the popular masses that particular nobles issued from the start of the public demonstrations.216 The changing social character of the Revolution - in the thesis to be put forward here - was determined in the first place by the defence and loss of this power of interpreting the contents of the public sphere. This development arose from the dynamics of public communication in word, text and physical presence, but at the same time from a shift in the possession of power. The holders of privilege might seek to engage the means of generalised power for their own - differing - purposes, but this was no longer immediately possible due to the broad political-religious public that had come into being in the meantime. To the same extent, those forces that pressed for more far-reaching reform in Parliament could - until almost the end of the decade - use public debate as an argument in favour of their own demands. What was up for reform above all was the practice of monarchical rule, and especially ecclesiastical rule. Within ten months after its opening, the Long Parliament carried through a partial constitutionalisation of monarchical power: from now on Parliament had to be summoned at least every three years, mak-ing it an institution of monarchical rule. Parliament was not to be dismissed without the agreement of its members (which is why it continued formally in being through all the changes until 16 March 1660). The most important instruments of a practice of rule that had offered the possibility of difference between generalised estate interests and royal practice - the courts of Star Chamber and High Commission - were abolished. Parliamentary participation in the use of the king's fiscal power was formally confirmed. All these laws received the assent of the king. Although he evidently accepted them only under pressure and out of tactical considerations, they remained in force after 1660. The constitutional reform that was accomplished in this way - subsequently described as ‘gentry constitutionalism' - left the king with a large part of his prerogative power. The personal character of monarchical rule was not abolished but confirmed. This was done in particular by the way that all the mistakes of ‘thorough' were blamed on the king's advisers, especially Laud and Strafford. The Lords, however, opposed the condemnation of the latter for high treason, for Thomas Wentworth, first Earl of Strafford, had acted throughout on behalf of the king. His condemnation was therefore effected by Act of Parliament (attainder) rather than judicial verdict - i.e. in the form of a political and not a legal decision. On the day set for the first reading of this bill, many armed men - including very well-to-do and eminent citizens - lined both sides of the route that Members of Parliament took to the chamber. On the following readings, the social composition of these demonstrations changed and the tone of their cries grew sharper. The pressure on the king to consent to the execution of his minister was reinforced by the demand that many thousand had made on Parliament.217 But Parliament was not immediately led by this broad public to those fur-ther measures for which radical members had called, especially John Pym and Isaak Penington. In summer 1641, many members of both houses fled London on account of the plague. Others found the sessions of this already exceptionally prolonged Parliament much too extensive. Parliament took a break in September, during which it was represented by a committee of members. It was not the radicali-sation of the public sphere nor even the strategy of the radical reformers in Parliament, but the armed insurrection that broke out in Ireland in October 1641, which together with the king's strategies made clear that his consent to the reform laws could not be trusted, creating a new pressure for Parliament to act. The immediate expression of this was in the debates over the Grand Remonstrance that same month. These debates of October 1641 ended the traditional practice of seeking consensus in Parliament. By a bare majority, the power of the king over the military force required to put down the Irish rebellion was made dependent on his consent to parliamentary selection of his advisers and a reform of the church. But a proposal to have the Remonstrance printed, i.e. to turn expressly to the public, was not carried (the balance of forces for this thus being significantly different than for the actual list of demands). This did not however prevent the printing and distribution of the demands that had been made. The vain attempt of the king to have five radical members of the House of Commons arrested, with a view to putting them on trial for high treason, the rejection of the Grand Remonstrance and the removal of the royal family from London, faced Parliament with the decision, at the beginning of 1642, to organise generalised military power in the kingdom on its own behalf (even if still in the name of the king) or else abandon all plans to reform monarchical rule. With the decree on the militia of March 1642, Parliament claimed for the first time full legal power for a decision that did not have the consent of the king. The Militia Ordinance was revolutionary law, even if many of those who voted it saw this as no more than an emergency procedure until the king came to his senses. With this decree, the counties were drawn into the dispute between the king and his Parliament for the first time. Until then, most of the rural lords, though aware of the political conflicts going on,218 saw no need to take sides. Both sides, moreover, still insisted that their goal was the restora-tion of the ‘old law', while at a time of widespread social disturbance, many of the landed nobility, yeomen, large farmers and civic burgesses saw no more pressing task than the maintenance of local peace. In early summer of 1642, when the crown on the one hand (through the ‘commissions of array', an ancient feudal form of organisation of armed force) and Parliament on the other, set about organising local armed force, it was first of all Justices of the Peace, lords lieutenant, deputies lieutenant and sheriffs who found themselves at a moment of decision, followed soon by large sec-tions of the population. Efforts were frequently made to avoid this by opting for neutrality - in part genuinely, in part just formally - or by individuals obeying instructions from both sides to have money and horses ready. Until the actual outbreak of armed conflict, it was also possible for particular districts to preserve their neutrality.219 Local studies indicate that in many places the decision for one side or the other depended principally on whether it was the king's instructions or those of Parliament that first arrived. In other areas (especially in the North), a dis-trict took its cue from the attitude of local magnates. That appropriation by way of trade and manufacture formed no obstacle to royalist sympathies has been abundantly shown by recent studies,220 and the correspondence that Christopher Hill demonstrated between certain agricultural forms of appro-priation and dominant political orientations can also be explained by the locally dominant structures of the noble hierarchy. Finally, the early political commitment of Puritans to the Parliamentary cause, which J.S. Morrill has emphasised,221 should be corrected in that this is only clearly demonstrable after the outbreak of the war.222 For the year 1642, the patterns of local factions appear mainly as ‘devia-tions' from models of explanation in strictly social and religious terms. This is readily understandable, in so far as the question at this time was still that of the most suitable way to reform monarchical rule. In a political-strategic decision such as this, all kinds of considerations, customs, and faulty judge-ments could come into play. As against the customary emphasis in recent research on a number of separate factors in such decision, as well as reference to the unreliability of earlier generalisations, it should not be overlooked here that the larger part of the peerage and higher gentry were royalist, whereas members of the lower gentry and citizens of towns tended rather - if in no way exclusively - to ‘defend' the rights of Parliament and wish to see them extended. There were in addition regional centres of gravity. The North, Wales, and the South-West tended to support the crown, East Anglia, the South-East and the south to support Parliament - in each case with individual exceptions. Above all, however - and the significance of this has all too often been pressed into the background by regional studies - in London a more radical public prevailed against the considerable royalist forces in the City, where Charles I still had full confidence in its leaders in December 1641.223 With the election of new members to the Common Council, conditions were created in which the demands of London citizens and inhabitants on Parliament could no longer be withstood by the authorities. Whilst this did not make the City authority into an instrument of the people, it was from early summer 1642 an instrument of the policy represented in Parliament.224”翻译为中文","output":"我们在考虑1640年之后几年的事件时，首先应该记住的政治决策的出现和有效性的第一个结构性条件是，这场公开讨论教会的事务（这里只是概述），它试图使议会成为自下而上希望但需自上而下实施的教会改革的工具。正是在这个公共领域的背景下，议会做出了决定，并且这些决定也受到了评判。 另一方面，议会成员试图将公众作为他们自己政策的工具。这同样适用于支持主教统治的维护者。在那段时间，有些希望改革王国的人特别关注废除任意征税，其他人关注讲道自由。对他们中的大多数人来说，确实是关乎权利、自由和特权的问题。议会成员当然视自己为王国的代表，因此也代表了现在出现的公共领域，但这并没有使贵族们准备放弃这一权利——可能有个别例外——去解释哪些要求对国家有益。如果今天的“修正主义”历史学家坚持许多贵族寻求领导大众，他们实际关注的是对公共辩论内容解释权的主张。然而，实现这一要求是不可能的。因为从一开始，议会的决定也假设了对公共领域允许状态的辩论，即有权将议会——也包括伦敦市议会——通过大规模请愿和示威活动置于压力之下的权利。议会试图将公众用于其自身目的的尝试，遭到了相反尝试的反击，即试图将议会变成公共领域的工具，成为民意的“代理人”，就像几年后的“大抗议书”所要求的那样。由此构成的政治矛盾可能不会自动获得稳定力量的结果，这一点从一开始贵族们就发出了可能的大众激进化的许多警告可见。 革命的社会性质的变化——在此提出的论点中——首先由公共领域内容解释权的捍卫和丧失决定。这一发展源于文字、文本和身体存在的公共传播动态，同时也源于权力占有的转移。特权持有者可能寻求将普遍权力的手段用于他们自己的——不同的——目的，但由于与此同时出现的广泛的政治宗教公共领域，这已不再立即可能。在同等程度上，那些在议会中推动更深远改革的力量可以——直到十年代末几乎结束时——将公共辩论作为支持他们自己要求的论据。 最需改革的主要是君主制的实践，特别是教会统治。在开幕后的十个月内，长期议会实现了君主权力的部分宪政化：从现在起，议会至少每三年召开一次，成为君主制统治的机构。议会不能在成员同意下被解散（这就是为什么它在所有变动中一直正式存在直到1660年3月16日）。提供了普遍贵族利益与王室实践之间可能差异的统治实践的最重要工具——星室法庭和高级委员会法庭被废除。议会对国王的财政权力使用的参与得到了正式确认。所有这些法律都获得了国王的同意。尽管他显然是在压力下出于战术考虑才接受它们，但这些法律在1660年后仍然有效。 以这种方式完成的宪政改革——后来被描述为“绅士宪政”——仍然保留了国王的大部分特权权力。君主制的个人特征并未被废除，而是得到了确认。特别是通过将“彻底”政策的所有错误归咎于国王的顾问，尤其是劳德和斯特拉福德的方式实现了这一点。然而，贵族们反对以叛国罪定罪斯特拉福德，因为托马斯·温特沃思，第一代斯特拉福德伯爵，完全是代表国王行事。因此，他的定罪是通过议会法案（剥夺权利法案）而不是司法裁定来实现的——即以政治而非法律决策的形式。 为这项法案首次阅读而设定的日子，许多武装男子——包括非常富有和杰出的市民——站在议会成员前往议事厅的路线的两侧。在接下来的阅读中，这些示威的社会组成发生了变化，他们的呼喊声变得更加尖锐。通过成千上万人向议会提出的要求，增强了对国王同意执行他的大臣的压力。 但是，并非这个广泛的公共立即将议会引向那些激进成员特别是约翰·皮姆和艾萨克·佩宁顿所呼吁的进一步措施。 1641年夏天，由于瘟疫，许多议会两院的成员逃离伦敦。其他人觉得这个已经异常漫长的议会会议太过冗长。9月份，议会休会，由议会成员组成的委员会代表议会行事。并非公共领域的激进化，也不是议会中激进改革者的策略，而是1641年10月爆发的爱尔兰武装叛乱，再加上国王的策略，明确显示他对改革法律的同意是不可信的，为议会采取行动创造了新的压力。这在同月的大抗议书辩论中得到了直接体现。1641年10月的辩论结束了议会寻求共识的传统做法。以微弱多数，议会将国王对平息爱尔兰叛乱所需军事力量的控制权，取决于他同意议会选择他的顾问和教会改革。但提议将抗议书印刷出来，即明确向公众表态的提案未能通过（因此在实际要求列表上的力量平衡显然与实际情况有很大不同）。然而，这并没有阻止所提要求的印刷和分发。 国王试图逮捕五名激进的下议院成员，试图以叛国罪起诉他们，大抗议书的拒绝以及皇室家庭离开伦敦的企图，使得1642年初的议会面临决定，要么代表自己（即使仍以国王的名义）组织王国的普遍军事力量，要么放弃所有改革君主制统治的计划。 1642年3月的民兵法令中，议会首次对未获国王同意的决定主张完全合法权力。民兵法令是革命性的法律，尽管许多投票支持它的人将其视为一种临时措施，直到国王恢复理智。通过这一法令，各郡第一次被卷入国王与议会之间的争端。直到那时，尽管大多数乡村贵族都意识到正在进行的政治冲突，但他们看不到站队的必要。而且，双方还坚称他们的目标是恢复“旧法”，在广泛的社会动荡时期，许多土地贵族、自耕农、大农场主和市民士绅认为没有比维护地方和平更紧迫的任务了。 1642年初夏，当一方（通过“征召令”，一种古老的封建武装力量组织形式）和另一方议会开始组织地方武装力量时，首先是治安法官、郡中尉、副郡中尉和警长发现自己处于决策的时刻，紧接着是大部分人口。人们常常试图通过选择中立——部分是真诚的，部分仅仅是形式上的——或者按双方的指示准备好钱财和马匹来避免这种情况。直到武装冲突实际爆发，特定地区还是可能保持中立的。 地方研究表明，在许多地方，选择一方或另一方主要取决于国王的指示或议会的指示先到达。在其他地区（特别是北部），一个地区的态度取决于当地显贵的态度。最近的研究充分表明，通过贸易和制造获得的财富并不妨碍对保王党的同情，克里斯托弗·希尔展示的某些农业占有形式与主导政治取向之间的对应也可以通过当地贵族等级结构的主导地位来解释。最后，J.S. 莫里尔强调的清教徒对议会事业的早期政治承诺应该纠正，因为这仅在战争爆发后才明显可见。 对于1642年来说，地方派系的模式主要表现为从严格的社会和宗教角度解释的“偏差”。这是可以理解的，因为当时的问题仍然是改革君主制统治的最佳方式。在这样一个政治战略性决策中，各种考虑、习惯和错误判断都可能发挥作用。对于最近研究中对这种决策的各种单独因素的常规强调，以及提到之前概括的不可靠性，这里不应忽视大部分贵族和高级绅士都是保王党，而下级绅士和城镇居民往往——尽管不是唯一的——倾向于“捍卫”议会的权利，并希望看到它们得到扩展。 此外，还有地区重心。北部、威尔士和西南部倾向于支持国王，东安格利亚、东南部和南部倾向于支持议会——每种情况都有个别例外。然而，最重要的是——地方研究经常将这一点的重要性淡化——在伦敦，一个比城市中相当数量的保王党力量更激进的公众占了上风，查尔斯一世在1641年12月仍然完全信任其领导人。随着新成员被选入公共议会，为伦敦公民和居民对议会的要求创造了条件，当局不再能够抵制这些要求。尽管这并没有使市政府成为人民的工具，但从1642年初夏起，它成为了议会代表的政策的工具。"},{"instruction":"请将“、For the structural analysis of the Revolution, the precise social composition of the opposing factions is perhaps less important than the fact that the king still had considerable support when from early summer 1642 the division of power in the kingdom was challenged by military preparations, and by actual armed conflict from August on. When the king set up his standard in Not-tingham on 22 August, moreover, this was also a sign that he was ready to force Parliament to his will by armed force. At all events, the progress of the military struggle in the first years of the Civil War should already give pause for reflection to anyone eager to derive a historical necessity of the Revolution (and thus also its victory) from 'preconditions'. In the long run, Parliament had more money at its disposal than the king, and quite likely, on the whole, also more convinced support. But of the sixteen major battles of the first year, the Cavaliers, as the royalists were soon called, won seven, and a different leadership could have made greater military use of these victories than the royalist officers succeeded in doing. It did not seem a certain conclusion in the first years of the war that Parliament would be able to obtain further material resources, and the war was definitely not won in advance in this way for the Parliamentary cause (and thus for 'historical progress', however defined).225 Victory only became possible because the heads of the Parliamentary side were able to conclude a military and church-policy alliance with the Scots, and because they were finally also ready to engage in more far-reaching political innovations than the great majority of them had intended at the start of the war. These innovations made Parliament, which had previously been simply an advisory board, into a government, organising itself to a large extent by way of commissions. They also affected the forms of taxation. Above all, however, they related to the organisation of armed force. In the course of the Civil War this was nationalised, at least incipiently. This, however, meant that armed force (and the civilian forms of securing its recruitment and provision) could not be integrated automatically into the former structure of locally generalised estate rule under the leading families of the nobility. The preconditions for the possibility of political developments that ran diametrically counter to the original intentions of the reforming nobility were thus a product of the war, or more precisely, of the fact that the civil war was not decided in advance in favour of those who had access to greater material resources. Initially, in the first two years of the war, both sides kept as far as possible to the traditional structures of military organisation. As high commander of his army, the king made use of a newly created Council of War, as well as of local administrative personnel who could be guided and supervised by regional ‘commissions of array'. Wherever possible, local courts or assemblies were to be involved in these commissions' measures. Until the end of the Second Civil War, it was more or less this form of organisation that remained responsible for the deployment of the king's armed force. This was, at first, quite a strongly centralised structure, as there was a single army under the command of the king, even though it was strongly marked by local conditions (the relation of the commanders of local army divisions to the high command remained unclear), as was also the case with its recruitment and provision. Finance of the royalist army was effected both by local charges and by the loans of certain members of London corporations (if no longer by the City as a whole), not least also by foreign credits. In comparison with that of the crown, the armed force of Parliament was initially far less centralised, and characterised by a dual military structure: the militias that were established and supplied locally remained under the local command of lords lieutenant and their deputies, for the selection of which Parliament still held in 1642 to the traditional practice of appointing peers to the lord lieutenancies and members of leading gentry families as their deputies.226 Parliament itself took on the high command. But Parliament only had directly under its control an army of some 10,000 men. Along with the widespread desire for political neutrality, and the consequent refusal to deploy local militia outside its county of origin, this sharp organisational divi-sion meant a significant limitation on the military power of Parliament. The attempt was made to overcome the prevailing military localism by uniting the militia of several counties. Only one of these, however, functioned with any real success: the Eastern Association. For the financing of the army, Parliament initially resorted mainly to loans. Merchants were 'invited' to continue paying the duties of tonnage and pound-age, which had previously been vigorously opposed, and the counties were required to donate money or precious metal. Instead of having to support the parliamentary army, however, the counties sought to keep money in London for the equipment of the armed men they provided. In the spring of 1643, Par-liament found itself constrained to introduce a new financing system. Every-one whose income was higher than that of a day-labourer was to pay a weekly charge, well-off landowners were forced to make loans, and the lands of roy-alists were confiscated and sold. This taxation was revolutionary in so far as it was raised without the consent of the king. It was higher than the previously practised forms of taxation, and signified an attack on the traditional forms of rule in the counties. County Committees were established to enforce it, and these were not necessarily staffed by men who had previously been seen as worthy of office in the locality. The armed force that Parliament organised was neither a people's army, nor indeed an army of those God-fearing men who demanded the reform of the kingdom in their sermons and petitions. It was, rather, a military organisation established by a particular group of lords in a largely traditional manner, in order to accomplish their political goals. As a consequence, many soldiers were forcibly conscripted - as on previous occasions - and many of these likewise tried to desert. The remainder often behaved in so ill-disciplined a fashion that the population had good reason to fear them even in regions which were well-disposed towards Parliament. This situation was not immediately changed in fundamentals by the reform of the parliamentary armed forces carried out in 1645, as Mark Kishlansky showed in a pioneering work.227 The New Model Army was at first neither politically radical nor even politically unified. It was thus not the arm of the radicals in Parliament. Nor did the New Model Army abolish right away the former practice of generalised estate rule over armed force. At the end of 1644, the military situation gave many religious-minded men the occasion to consider how they could make the parliamentary cause more appealing to God, and what practical measures they could take to participate fully in his mercy. In so far as it bore on general political structures, this self-criticism of the politically active pious rulers rapidly focused on those aspects of personal rule that had formerly made it possible and customary for individual honour and profit to be drawn from the possession of office, while promotion of the ‘common weal' came second at best. In November 1644, a commission was set up to investigate what part of the profits of office should still be generally retained,228 and in December the House of Commons passed the so-called ‘self-denying ordinance', which required members of both Houses to voluntarily renounce public office, both civilian and military. In this way - said Cromwell in Parliament - none of our enemies could say that members of either House had no interest in a swift end to the war, because it gave them opportunities to use their offices for individual advance. The view that the implementation of this decision would lead to a very considerable depersonalisation of the structures of rule was formulated by the London captain of militia Thomas Juxon, when he maintained that for the first time now, the Members of Parliament had behaved as the Commons of England, representatives of the salus populi.229 Yet the Lords were unwilling to go that far in their efforts to win God's mercy and supply no arguments to the enemy. They would thereby have renounced the final remnants of their personal military power. If this power no longer amounted to a legally fixed possession, the great nobles still maintained their traditionally established right to positions of command. The House of Lords rejected the proposed legislation, proposing instead that members of both Houses should simply give up their civilian offices. In April 1645, this position - marking as it did the start of a deterioration in the relations between the two Houses of parliament, the appearance of estate-structured conflict among the supporters of the parliamentary cause - could no longer continue. Together with a centralisation of military power - not complete, but clearly strengthened in relation to previous structures - new high commanders were appointed by Parliament, after the precautionary dismissal of the previous ones. The selection of per-sonnel again led to a certain controversy between the two Houses, in which connection - according to Kishlansky230 - the amendments of the House of Lords to the Commons proposal were a function partly of patronage interests, partly of military considerations, and also - to a degree that is impossible to precisely measure - of religious orientations. Military strategy would now be determined by a committee of both kingdoms, in which the generals who had just been dismissed (or retired), the earls of Essex and Manchester, remained members. Above all, however, the New Model Army remained an instrument of Parliament. Its military efficacy - increased by the reform and by the policy of the two new commanders - finally brought victory in the First Civil War. In 1646, after putting himself in the hands of the Scots, the king signed a declaration of capitulation. Parliament, having waged war against the king, was now faced with the situation of having to settle the peace. In the meantime the political situation had greatly changed: in both London and the regions conflict had arisen over the possession of local rule, many Puritans had been become radicalised in their religious and socio-political views, and new reli-gious groups had emerged. Demands circulated among the public that went far beyond those that Parliament had put to the king at the start of the civil war. In certain places there had been social disturbances. ”翻译为中文","output":"对于革命的结构分析来说，对立派系的确切社会组成可能不如以下事实重要：从1642年初夏开始，当王国权力分配因军事准备和从8月份开始的实际武装冲突受到挑战时，国王仍然得到了相当大的支持。此外，当国王于8月22日在诺丁汉竖立他的旗帜时，这也是一个信号，表明他准备通过武装力量迫使议会屈服于他的意愿。无论如何，内战前几年的军事斗争进程应该使任何急于从“前提条件”中推导革命（因而也包括其胜利）的历史必然性的人深思熟虑。 从长远来看，议会比国王拥有更多的资金，很可能总体上也拥有更坚定的支持。但在第一年的十六场主要战役中，保王党人，很快被称为骑兵，赢得了七场，不同的领导层本可以比保王党军官更有效地利用这些胜利进行军事利用。在战争的最初几年，议会能够获得进一步的物质资源并非确定的结论，这场战争绝对不是预先就为议会事业（因此也为“历史进步”，不论如何定义）赢得的。 只有因为议会一方的领导者能够与苏格兰人达成军事和教会政策联盟，并且因为他们最终也准备进行比战争开始时绝大多数人打算的更深远的政治改革，胜利才成为可能。 这些创新使得之前仅仅是一个咨询机构的议会变成了政府，很大程度上通过委员会进行自我组织。它们还影响到了税收形式。然而，最重要的是，它们涉及到武装力量的组织。在内战过程中，这一力量至少在初步上是国家化的。然而，这意味着武装力量（及其招募和供给的民事形式）不能自动融入到以前由贵族主要家族领导的地方性普遍贵族统治结构中。因此，革命的初始意图与战争彻底相反的政治发展的可能性的前提条件是这场战争的产物，更确切地说，是内战并不是预先决定为拥有更多物质资源者胜利的事实的产物。 起初，在战争的前两年，双方尽可能保持了传统的军事组织结构。作为其军队的最高指挥官，国王利用了新成立的战争委员会，以及可以由地区性“征召令”委员会指导和监督的地方行政人员。只要可能，地方法院或集会应参与这些委员会的措施。直到第二次内战结束，这种组织形式或多或少负责了国王武装力量的部署。起初，这是一个相当集中的结构，因为有一支在国王指挥下的单一军队，尽管它受到地方条件的强烈影响（地方军队指挥官与高级指挥部的关系仍然不清楚），招募和供给也是如此。保王党军队的资金既来自地方负担，也来自伦敦某些公司成员（如果不再是整个城市）的贷款，尤其是外国信贷。 与国王的武装力量相比，议会的武装力量最初要不那么集中，且具有双重军事结构：在地方建立和供应的民兵仍然处于郡中尉及其副手的地方指挥之下，对于这些人的选择，议会仍然坚持1642年任命贵族担任郡中尉和任命主要绅士家族成员为其副手的传统做法。议会本身承担了最高指挥权。但议会只直接控制着约1万人的军队。加上对政治中立的广泛渴望，以及因此拒绝在其原籍县外部署地方民兵，这一明显的组织分歧意味着议会的军事力量受到了重大限制。通过联合几个县的民兵来克服盛行的军事地方主义的尝试只有一个取得了真正成功：东部联盟。 为了筹集军队资金，议会最初主要依赖贷款。商人被“邀请”继续缴纳以往受到强烈反对的吨税和磅税，而各郡被要求捐赠金钱或贵金属。然而，各郡试图将钱款留在伦敦以装备其提供的武装人员，而不是用来支持议会军队。到了1643年春，议会发现自己被迫引入了一种新的融资系统。任何收入高于日工人的人都必须每周缴纳费用，富有的地主被迫提供贷款，而保皇党人的土地被没收并出售。这种税收是革命性的，因为它是在未经国王同意的情况下征收的。这种税收高于之前实行的税收形式，并且意味着对郡县传统统治形式的攻击。县级委员会成立以执行此税收，这些委员会的成员不一定是之前被视为在当地值得担任职务的人。 议会组织的武装力量既不是人民军队，也确实不是那些在讲道和请愿书中要求改革王国的敬畏上帝的人的军队。相反，它是一个特定贵族集团以大体传统的方式建立的军事组织，用于实现他们的政治目标。因此，许多士兵被强迫征召——就像以前的情况一样——他们中的许多人同样试图逃跑。剩下的人经常表现得如此缺乏纪律，以至于即使在对议会持友好态度的地区，人们也有充分的理由害怕他们。 1645年对议会武装力量进行的改革并没有立即从根本上改变这种情况，正如马克·基斯兰斯基在一项开创性工作中所展示的那样。新模范军最初既不是政治上的激进，甚至也不是政治上的统一。因此，它不是议会中激进派的武装力量。新模范军也没有立即废除先前对武装力量的普遍贵族统治的做法。 到1644年底，军事局势给了许多虔诚的人一个机会，考虑他们如何能让议会事业更加讨上帝的喜欢，以及他们可以采取哪些实际措施充分参与上帝的恩典。就普遍政治结构而言，这种政治上活跃的虔诚统治者的自我批评很快聚焦于个人统治的那些方面，这些方面过去使得从官职中获得个人荣誉和利益成为可能和惯例，而促进“公共福祉”最多只能排在第二位。1644年11月，成立了一个委员会来调查官职收入的哪一部分仍应普遍保留，到了12月，下议院通过了所谓的“自我否定令”，要求两院的成员自愿放弃公职，包括文职和军职。正如克伦威尔在议会中所说，这样一来，我们的敌人就不能说两院的任何成员对战争的迅速结束没有兴趣，因为这给了他们机会利用自己的职务谋取个人进步。 当伦敦民兵队长托马斯·朱克森声称，议员们第一次表现得像英格兰的平民，代表人民的福祉时，他表达了这一决定将导致统治结构非常大程度去人格化的观点。然而，贵族们不愿意为赢得上帝的恩典和不给敌人提供论据而走得那么远。这将使他们放弃个人军事力量的最后残余。如果这种力量不再构成法定固定的占有，大贵族们仍然维持着对指挥职位的传统确立权利。上议院拒绝了提议的立法，反而提议两院的成员只需放弃其文职。到了1645年4月，这一立场——标志着两院间关系恶化的开始，议会事业支持者之间出现了贵族结构化的冲突——已无法继续。伴随着军事力量的集中——虽不完全，但相对于先前结构明显加强——议会在预先免职了先前的指挥官后，任命了新的高级指挥官。人事选拔再次引发了两院之间的某些争议，据基斯兰斯基所述，上议院对下议院提案的修正部分是出于保护利益，部分是出于军事考虑，还有一部分——无法精确衡量——是出于宗教取向。军事策略现在将由两个王国的委员会确定，刚刚被解职（或退休）的将军们，埃塞克斯伯爵和曼彻斯特伯爵，仍是委员会成员。然而，最重要的是，新模范军仍然是议会的工具。其通过改革和两位新指挥官的政策增强的军事效能最终在第一次内战中取得了胜利。 1646年，国王在投靠苏格兰人后签署了投降声明。议会在与国王交战后，现在面临着要解决和平条款的局面。与此同时，政治局势已经发生了很大变化：在伦敦和地区出现了对地方统治的争夺冲突，许多清教徒在宗教和社会政治观点上变得激进，新的宗教团体出现了。公众中流传的要求远远超出了内战开始时议会对国王提出的要求。某些地方出现了社会骚乱。"},{"instruction":"请将“The revolutionary attack on generalised estate rule The Revolution of 1648-9 grew out of the attempt of a considerable section of the lords to persuade the king to make peace, so that by abandoning earlier demands they could jointly defend their rule, now endangered by politically radicalised forces, social climbers, and substantial social unrest. To prevent this and create instead a more just world was the goal of the revolutionaries, who - in varying and somewhat contrary demands - aimed at the introduction of a representative constitution with general elections, the abolition of the monarchy, reform of the judicial system, the establishment of a better order in the church (if not the actual preparation of the realm of God on earth), and the abolition or attenuation of former social injustices. If this actually led to revolution, a precondition for this was the formation of a radical political and religious public, and especially the fact that large parts of both the military and administrative power and the press were de facto in the hands of 'radicals'. It was against what they saw as a dangerous situation that had arisen, that a parliamentary majority that had become or remained 'conservative' made their proposals to the king. Important new features of the situation were changes in the army and the form of regional administration. For four years, soldiers had been billeted on the population, requisitioning provisions and demanding horses, and even in localities under parliamentary control there had been attacks on civilians, not to mention the costs of this plague, which the County Committees met by drastic measures. If we can trust the words of their opponents, these committees were made up of outsiders who failed to pay due respect to the old-established families of the local nobility. They even included a number of artisans - on the Isle of Wight for example a hawker, an apothecary, a baker and two farmers - as well as others who were in no way members of the ruling estates.231 On the whole, the committees were run by men with a certain level of wealth and education. But there was certainly a clear tendency for the former restrictive estate selection for office in the local administrations to be at least widened to a certain degree, if not completely abolished. When Parliament decided to disband the army and send a part of it to Ire-land, to put down the Catholic rebellion there and prevent a possible alliance with the king, this corresponded with the demands of many petitions that had been received from London and the regions. When peace proposals were put to the king, providing for the immediate abolition of the County Committees once these were accepted, this followed the wishes of many lords who had until recently supported the parliamentary cause.232 The extent to which the political situation had changed is shown by the local defence forces in Somerset - ultimately under the control of the local sheriff - who tried to imprison marauding soldiers who crossed the county on their way to Ireland. In some districts, soldiers also laid siege to the County Committees, demanding payment of their outstanding wages.233 The army opposed demobilisation without the settlement of arrears of pay going back at least a year, and without arrangements that would guarantee the fulfilment of demands previously raised. Many members of the County Committees were radicalised when threatened with the loss of office. Mark Kishlansky has ascribed the cause of political radicalisation in the first place to the decision taken by Parliament to disband the army, with no concern for the material interests of the soldiers, and secondly also to the unwillingness of soldiers to be sent to Ireland. The Levellers above all maintained that it would be an unlawful war, a cruel and bloody work to go destroy to the Irish Natives for their Consciences, and to drive them from their proper natural and native rights.234 Kishlansky's line of argument does not go far enough. He certainly shows that the politicisation of the army took place later, and the agitational success of the Levellers among the soldiers was less, than had long been supposed by historians; that material interest formed the basis of the (limited) political unity of the army and a precondition for its development into a factor of political power. But even those soldiers pressed into the army must have heard the political rhetoric that was developed to justify their bloody work. If a declara-tion of 1647 stated that they were not a mere mercenary Army, hired to serve any Arbitrary power of a State: but called forth by several Declarations of Parliament, to the defence of our owne and the peoples just rights and liberties,235 this certainly formulates a political opinion that only became widespread as a result of the specific developments of that year. This does not mean, however, that it did not already have a basis in earlier experiences. The organisation of resistance in the army began, moreover, in the cavalry, which, unlike the infantry, was almost entirely manned by volunteers, with a somewhat higher level of education than the compulsorily enlisted soldiers. Early in 1647, the cavalry regiments commanded by Cromwell elected 'agents'. The Levellers, supporters of a radical political tendency that at the time of its greatest influence had a regular organisation with formalised rules and membership dues, drew up a petition to the Commons. This was signed by Many thousands, earnestly desiring the Glory of God, the freedome of the Common-Wealth and the peace of all men.236 Even before this petition was officially submitted to Parliament, the majority of Members expressed their opposition to the demands it raised, refused further petitions and threatened to punish the objectors for disturbing the peace.237 People who had just begun to insist on their civil rights were thus refused access to the public sphere. March 1647 saw the start of an open campaign for public support. Parliament reacted not just with bans and the threat of punishment, but with the (difficult) procurement of a credit from London merchants for the purpose of paying arrears of at least six weeks, and above all the attempt to persuade the king to accept its demands. In the army, however, there was organisation of resistance - which Parliament branded as rebellion. In Oxford, too, a printing press was established for the purpose of making the demands of the soldiers known to the people.238 It was no longer Parliament they were addressing (the delegation Parliament sent to negotiate had to withdraw empty-handed), but rather a broad public that was becoming revolutionary. In this public conflict with the established forms of rule in the kingdom, the agitators in the army, the Levellers who were especially active in London, and the many new (often chiliastic) religious groups that objected to any kind of political regulation of belief, all gathered increasing strength. Parliament reacted with a stress on the traditional privilege that its debates should not be put under pressure, and thus refused the public any influence on its discussions. From the standpoint of the lords' traditional privileges, the demand (raised in particular by the Levellers) that the influence of the public should be institutionalised meant genuine rebellion - despite the fact that for centuries Parliament had acted on the basis of petitions, and in the first years of the Revolution certain members had themselves promoted the drafting of petitions. The question at issue, as Kishlansky has shown, was not whether there should be a complete end to petitions, but rather the privilege of Parlia-ment to select from the public sphere those aspects that coincided with the views of the majority in the House. Besides bans and sporadic offers to negoti-ate, the representatives of the previous ‘good order' had little to oppose to the increasingly revolutionary public both within and without the army. When in June the ‘glorious decision' of the army not to let itself be disbanded before the soldiers' demands were met was accepted in the regiments by acclamation, this meant that the practical possession of armed force would be turned to political account. The army now acted in fact as a power potential in its own right. To implement this strategy an army council was created, by expanding the council of war of the senior officers that already existed by two junior officers and two private soldiers from each regiment. When the parliamentary majority called the London militia to arms, this attempt to put the army back under the control of Parliament was halted by its advance on London. In June, a junior officer - Joyce - and the soldiers under his command made the king a prisoner of the army, and the political demands formulated by its representatives now grew more far-reaching. In this first phase of politicisation of the army, political dominance lay with private soldiers, junior officers and a few radical higher officers. Generals Fairfax and Cromwell, together with the senior officers known as ‘grandees', now came to represent in their political milieu the demands of the rank and file. They also accepted the imprisonment of the king. In this way, they retained at least formal power of command over the de facto holders of armed force. By their struggle for the power to interpret the demands put forward by the army, and by use of the armed force at their disposal, they further reinforced and expanded their military command - and in the current situation, their political command as well. The struggle as to the contents of the army's demands was waged in the so- called Putney debates, the struggle over military command in the draconian suppression of the Ware mutiny. This arose because the army council had suppressed a resolution from the Levellers demanding universal suffrage (for every man except servants and beggars), and because it was also supposed that the 'grandees' had had a hand in the king's escape. With the suppression of this mutiny, the supremacy of the military command over the dynamic of public debate among the soldiers was decisively manifest. It was no accident that after this incident the influence of the Levellers in the army fell. This equally meant a decline in the possibility of a revolution that was genuinely determined by the people, or even a social revolution. A precondition for revolution is certainly a revolutionary public, but revolutions are decided not by argument, but by the effective threat or actual use of force. In 1647 an effective threat of force did indeed exist within the army, in both directions. In the later months of the year, therefore, a kind of political compromise was arrived at: for the sake of the ability of the army to act politically, the radical agitators accepted the command of the grandees, and these enforced military discipline by taking on some of the Levellers' demands - in particular the end of negotiations with the king.”翻译为中文","output":"对普遍贵族统治的革命性攻击 1648-9年的革命源于诸多贵族劝说国王和平的尝试，通过放弃早期的要求，他们可以共同捍卫现在受到政治激进分子、社会攀爬者和大量社会动荡威胁的统治。预防此事并创建一个更加公正的世界是革命者的目标，他们提出多种不同且有些相反的要求——引入带有普选的代议制宪法，废除君主制，改革司法体系，建立更好的教会秩序（如果不是在地球上实际准备天国的话），以及废除或减轻以前的社会不公。如果这真的导致了革命，一个先决条件是形成了激进的政治和宗教公共领域，特别是大部分军事和行政权力以及媒体实际上掌握在“激进分子”手中的事实。正是面对他们认为已经出现的危险局势，已经变得或仍然保守的议会多数向国王提出了他们的提议。 形势的重要新特点是军队和地区行政形式的变化。四年来，士兵驻扎在民众中，征用物资和要求提供马匹，甚至在议会控制的地区也有对平民的袭击，更不用说这场灾难的成本，这是由县级委员会通过严厉措施来应对的。如果我们相信他们的对手所言，这些委员会由不了解当地老牌贵族家庭应得的尊重的外来者组成。他们甚至包括一些手工艺人——例如在怀特岛上有一个小贩、一个药剂师、一个面包师和两个农民——以及其他根本不是统治阶层成员的人。总体而言，这些委员会由一定程度的财富和教育水平的男性管理。但肯定有一个明显的趋势，即对地方行政中职位的传统贵族选拔至少在一定程度上被扩大，如果不是完全废除的话。 当议会决定解散军队并派遣其中一部分前往爱尔兰，以镇压那里的天主教叛乱并防止与国王可能的联盟时，这符合伦敦和地区收到的许多请愿书的要求。当向国王提出和平提议时，一旦这些提议被接受，立即废除县级委员会，这符合许多直到最近还支持议会事业的贵族的愿望。 政治局势的变化程度可从索美塞特郡的地方防卫力量体现出来——最终受当地警长控制——他们试图监禁穿越该郡前往爱尔兰的掠夺性士兵。在一些地区，士兵还围攻县级委员会，要求支付他们未付的薪水。 军队反对在未解决至少一年的欠薪和未做出保证以前提出的要求得到满足的情况下解散，并且许多县级委员会的成员在面临失去职位的威胁时变得激进。 马克·基斯兰斯基首先将政治激进化归因于议会解散军队的决定，而不顾士兵的物质利益，其次也归因于士兵不愿意被派往爱尔兰。 平等派首先坚持认为前往爱尔兰进行战斗将是 一场非法战争，一项残酷而血腥的行动，旨在为了他们的信仰而摧毁爱尔兰土著，并将他们从他们固有的自然和本土权利中驱逐。 基斯兰斯基的论证并没有走得够远。他确实表明，军队的政治化发生得较晚，平等派在士兵中的宣传成功也不像历史学家长久以来所认为的那样，物质利益构成了军队（有限的）政治统一的基础，也是其发展成为政治力量的先决条件。但即使是被强征入伍的士兵也必定听说了为证明他们血腥工作所做的政治说辞。如果一份1647年的声明声称他们不是 纯粹的雇佣军队，被雇佣来为国家的任意权力服务：而是被议会的几份声明召唤，来捍卫我们自己和人民的正当权利与自由， 这显然表达了一种政治观点，只是由于那一年的特定发展而变得广泛。然而，这并不意味着它之前没有基于早期经验。 此外，军队中的抵抗组织始于骑兵队，与步兵队不同，骑兵队几乎完全由志愿者组成，受教育水平略高于被强制征募的士兵。 1647年初，克伦威尔指挥的骑兵团选举了“代理人”。当时影响力最大的平等派，是支持激进政治倾向的团体，有定期组织、正式规则和会费，起草了一份向下议院的请愿书。这份请愿书上签名了 许多成千上万的人，他们急切地渴望上帝的荣耀，共和国的自由和所有人的和平。 即使这份请愿书还未正式提交给议会，大多数议员已经表示反对其中提出的要求，拒绝进一步的请愿，并威胁说要因扰乱和平而惩罚反对者。因此，刚刚开始坚持自己公民权利的人们被拒绝进入公共领域。1647年3月，公开争取公众支持的活动开始。议会不仅用禁令和惩罚威胁做出反应，还通过（费力）从伦敦商人那里获得信贷以支付至少六周的欠薪，最重要的是，试图说服国王接受其要求。然而，在军队中，抵抗得到了组织——议会将之标记为叛乱。在牛津，也为了让士兵的要求为人民所知而设立了印刷机。他们不再向议会发出呼吁（议会派来谈判的代表空手而归），而是向变革中的广泛公众发出呼吁。 在这场与王国既定统治形式的公开冲突中，军队中的激进分子、尤其是在伦敦活跃的平等派，以及反对任何形式的信仰政治调节的许多新兴（通常是千年王国主义的）宗教团体，都获得了越来越大的力量。 议会通过强调其辩论不应受到外部压力的传统特权来回应，并因此拒绝公众对其讨论的任何影响。从贵族的传统特权立场来看，平等派特别提出的要求（使公众影响得到制度化）意味着真正的叛乱——尽管几个世纪以来议会一直基于请愿行事，在革命的最初几年中某些成员还促进了请愿书的起草。争议的问题，正如基斯兰斯基所示，并非是否应该完全终止请愿，而是议会的特权是从公共领域中挑选出与下议院多数观点一致的方面。除了禁令和零星的谈判提议外，之前“良好秩序”的代表对日益革命化的内外公众几乎没有什么反对意见。当6月军队“荣耀地决定”不在士兵的要求得到满足前解散时，这一决定在团队中得到欢呼，这意味着实际拥有武装力量的人将政治利用这一力量。军队现在实际上作为一种自身的力量潜力而行动。 为实施这一策略，通过将已有的高级军官战争委员会扩大以包括每个团的两名初级军官和两名士兵而创建了一个军队委员会。 当议会多数派召集伦敦民兵时，这一试图使军队重新受到议会控制的尝试被军队向伦敦推进所阻止。 6月，一名初级军官——乔伊斯——和他指挥下的士兵将国王变成军队的囚犯，军队代表提出的政治要求变得更加深远。在军队政治化的第一阶段，政治主导权在于士兵、初级军官和少数激进的高级军官。法克斯将军和克伦威尔以及被称为“大人物”的高级军官，现在在其政治环境中代表士兵的要求。他们也接受了国王被监禁。通过这种方式，他们至少保留了对实际掌握武装力量者的正式指挥权。通过争夺对军队要求解释的权力，以及使用其手中的武装力量，他们进一步加强和扩大了自己的军事指挥权——在当前形势下，也是他们的政治指挥权。关于军队要求的内容的斗争在所谓的普特尼辩论中进行，关于军事指挥权的斗争在对沃尔反叛的严厉镇压中体现。这起因为军队委员会压制了平等派提出的要求普遍选举权（对每个人除了仆人和乞丐）的决议，也因为人们认为“大人物”在国王逃跑中起了作用。通过镇压这次反叛，军队指挥部对士兵公共辩论动态的控制权显著体现。在这一事件之后，平等派在军队中的影响力减弱。这同样意味着由人民真正决定的革命，甚至是社会革命的可能性下降。革命的一个先决条件当然是革命性公共领域，但革命的决定不是靠争论，而是靠实际使用武力或有效威胁武力。1647年，军队内部确实存在武力的有效威胁，两个方向都是如此。因此，在那一年的后几个月，一种政治妥协达成了：为了军队的政治行动能力，激进的激进分子接受了大人物的指挥，而这些大人物通过采纳一些平等派的要求——特别是结束与国王的谈判——来执行军事纪律。"},{"instruction":"请将“In this way, there arose a moderately radical political position of the army (though it contained neither a programme for specific regulation of the church, nor even - as was often supposed - the demand for complete freedom of con-science). In 1648 the so-called Second Civil War settled the rival claims for power by military means. Its history, as Winston Churchill pertinently wrote, was 'short and simple'. The king, the Lords, the Commons, members of the gentry and merchants, City and country, bishops and Presbyterians, the Scot-tish army, the population of Wales and the navy, all now fought against the New Model Army. And this army defeated their combined forces.239 To summarise these events would mean introducing many different ele-ments - anti-Puritan popular uprisings and resistance,240 petitions and mass demonstrations against the County Committees,241 the pressure of London merchants for a reconciliation with the king, the mutinies in the navy and the struggles of the Scottish army that took the field on the king's side, as well as the public justifications that the parliamentary forces distributed across the country.242 All this we must leave aside here. After the military victory over the royalist forces and all who had risen up against the army and the County Committees, in August 1648 Parliament began peace negotiations with the king. It demanded command over the mili-tia for a period of twenty years, the participation of Parliament in the selection of the king's advisers and a Presbyterian church order. The parliamentary majority - including many Members who could earlier have been counted among the Independents - were prepared to accept the few concessions that the king finally agreed, despite massive protest and a major written complaint from the army, as the basis for a reconciliation with the monarch. This already shows how much more was at stake now than the extent of monarchical power. For the same reasons that led to the more successful attempt of 1660, the parliamentary majority voted to restore the monarchy on 4 December 1648 - ‘eleven years too early'.243 This development was prevented two days later, when the army took civil power into its control. Parliament remained in existence, but politically it was ‘purged' of those members who supported reconciliation with the king. ‘Pride's purge', as the imprisonment of a number of MPs by Colonel Pride came to be called, made possible the condemnation and execution of the king. It was the last concession of the moderate forces in Parliament and the gran-dees to the radical popular movement within the army. After the execution of the king in January 1649, England became a republic (although even then, many MPs would have preferred the appointment of a new king to the abolition of the monarchy). The House of Lords was abolished, followed in September 1650 by the penal code that since the Elizabethan religious settlement had enforced Sunday attendance in church. But this nearly completed the institutional results of the Revolution of 1648-9. There was no more mention of the Levellers' demands for a democratisation of estate rule. Instead of this, the radical leaders of the Levellers were imprisoned, and a mutiny by radical regiments in May 1649 was violently put down. The army thus became once more an instrument of politics. The specific form of estate rule this instrument was now to defend, however, was not yet decided. The following eleven years until the formal restoration of the monarchy - for in practice, a far-reaching personal possession of centralised power was re-introduced already under the Protectorate - were therefore marked by conflicts over political supremacy, or more accurately, over the structure of power-holding within the ruling estates. There continued to be demands for the abolition of estate privilege. But with the defeat of the 1649 mutinies, the possibility - however weak - of implement-ing social-revolutionary or even republican demands was finally removed.244 From now on, all those seeking far-reaching change were forced back again to arguments and forms of expression that were treated as 'rebellion' according to traditional practice. The religious radicals, and in particular champions of a 'fifth monarchy' (that of the Lord Jesus Christ, which was to redeem the previous four sinful periods of rule) could still have a certain influence. For, in the seventeenth century, the possible scope of religious arguments was still substantially greater than that of political and social-critical ones. But even hopes for the coming of the Kingdom of God on earth could not prevail in the long run against more immediate ruling interests. No more was this possible for those forms of communal possession of land that the 'true' Levellers (better known as the Diggers) began to put into practice in a number of small communes after 1649. In 1651 these experiments were forcibly ended. The republican, social-revolutionary and chiliastic popular movements competed with one another in their aims, and did not provide any basis for continuing the Revolution. They did, however, present a provocation to the present holders of power, and, to this extent, they also influenced the conflicts over its distribution.245 Nonetheless, the political struggles during the years that were later described as the Interregnum were essentially an affair between 'gentlemen'. The political constellations in these changed: especially between the 'new forces' in the county administrations and the army commanders. The political dominance of the latter peaked in 1655 when 'majorgenerals' were introduced as local governors with both military and civilian responsibilities (similar to the French intendants). This maximal centralisation of political power - for the major-generals were executors of a central government that was controlled (if not completely dominated) by the military - meant a still more far-reaching attack on the generalised estate rule of the English nobles than had already been institutionalised in the County Committees. Obstruction and open resistance quickly undermined the basis of this centralised power. This could happen because the government was dependent on the support of the ruling estates for its foreign policy - based on religion and trade and prosecuted by armed force. The abolition of the major-generals in 1657 marked Oliver Cromwell's attempt at a new political alliance. The personal rule with which the Protectorate had invested him had its foundation in his possession of military power. For its practice, however - just like the personal power that the king had possessed - this depended on the collaboration of a large proportion of the members of the ruling estates. Cromwell did indeed manage to find among these a supporting group for his political strategy: the men historians nowadays refer to as the ‘new Crom- wellians'. The request made to Cromwell in 1657 that he should be crowned king illustrates the content of this; though Cromwell's refusal indicates how he was well aware that acceptance would lose him the support of the army and thus an indispensable basis for his rule. The personal rule that the Lord Protector possessed was on the one hand institutionally reduced in comparison with that of the executed king, while on the other hand the presence of a standing army immensely expanded it. Exercise of this rule, however, demanded the collaboration of ‘gentlemen' - as otherwise neither the financing nor the authority of the new structures of office would be achievable. If the Protectorate government could maintain itself even though many of the leading noble families refused their collaboration or were excluded from it, this depended on the stabilisation of this specific form of government by military force (which had not been available to the king in the same degree). When this stabilising factor of the Protectorate disappeared with the death of Oliver Cromwell, as his son Richard (designated by his father as successor) had no political support in the army, the structural preconditions for the specific government form of the Protectorate also broke down. Likewise did those for the political dominance of the ‘new men' in local administration and in Parliament. The different forms of government of the year 1659 - the dissolution of Par-liament on 22 April; the flight of Richard Cromwell; the re-introduction of the so-called Rump Parliament of 1648 and the end of the Protectorate on 7 May, the military dismissal of the Rump Parliament on 26 December - were all stages in this process of decay. Because the combination of political repression and political disillusion had in the meantime deprived the regiments of their political character, there was no longer any basis for army unity, no matter how tense. When the military commanders found themselves in different political camps in January 1660, they could use the soldiers under their com-mand for competing political aims. General Monk was the most successful. He led the divisions under his command into London and summoned once more the Long Parliament 'purged' in 1648. This made the restoration of the monarchy certain. In London, the bells of all churches rang out the same eve-ning, and the bonfires that were lit in the streets cast a glow over the city.246 On 8 May 1660, Charles II was proclaimed king of England by a newly elected Parliament. c.2. Results of the Revolution Certainly a revolution, but not the end of an era In his well-known presentation of England's social and economic history from 1530 to 1780, Christopher Hill treats the decade of the 1640s as 'the end of medieval England'.247 Old institutions were abolished, above all the 'royal bureaucracy'.248 This supposedly introduced a change in economic structure. In place of an 'economic reform the basis of which were the monopoly companies', Hill saw the 'complete integration of English trade on the basis of a national monopoly, in which the state took on a leading role'.249 (The former monopoly companies were in no way completely abolished, but rather reached their apogee in the eighteenth century, especially the East India Company; but Hill leaves this out of the equation, as he does the continuance of tithes.) For Hill, the English Revolution really did do away with the 'feudal system'. Yet even so, this did not mean for him the immediate transition to capitalism. What arose instead was, rather, a kind of capitalism 'in spe’. For 'the political and legal conditions for further development had been created'.250”翻译为中文","output":"以这种方式，军队形成了一种中度激进的政治立场（尽管它没有包含对教会的具体调整方案，甚至——如常被假设的——对完全良心自由的要求）。1648年所谓的第二次内战通过军事手段解决了权力争夺。其历史，正如温斯顿·丘吉尔恰当地写道，是“简短且简单”的。国王、贵族、平民、绅士和商人、城市和乡村、主教和长老会派、苏格兰军队、威尔士人民和海军，所有这些势力都对抗新模范军。而这支军队击败了他们联合的力量。 总结这些事件意味着引入许多不同的元素——反清教徒的民众起义和抵抗、针对县级委员会的请愿和大规模示威、伦敦商人对与国王和解的压力、海军的兵变以及为国王而战的苏格兰军队的斗争，以及议会力量在全国分发的公开辩护。所有这些我们必须在此略过。 在击败保皇党势力和所有起来反对军队及县级委员会的人之后，议会于1648年8月开始与国王进行和平谈判。议会要求对民兵的指挥权为期二十年，议会参与国王顾问的选择和长老会教会秩序。议会多数派——包括许多此前可以算作独立派的成员——准备接受国王最终同意的少数让步，尽管军队提出了强烈抗议和主要书面投诉，但以此为基础与君主和解。这已经表明，现在的争论远不止于君主权力的范围。出于与1660年更成功尝试相同的原因，议会多数派于1648年12月4日投票恢复君主制 —— “早了十一年”。 两天后，当军队控制了民事权力时，这一发展被阻止。议会虽然继续存在，但在政治上被“清洗”了支持与国王和解的成员。“普赖德的清洗”，即由普赖德上校将一些议员监禁的行为，使得谴责和处决国王成为可能。这是议会中温和势力和大人物向军队中的激进民众运动的最后让步。 在1649年1月国王被处决后，英格兰成为了共和国（尽管即使在那时，许多议员宁愿任命新国王也不愿废除君主制）。上议院被废除，紧随其后的是1650年9月执行的自伊丽莎白时代宗教定居以来强制周日参加教堂的刑法。但这几乎完成了1648-9年革命的制度性成果。对平等派要求民主化贵族统治的提法再也没有提及。相反，平等派的激进领袖被监禁，1649年5月激进团队的叛乱被暴力镇压。军队因此再次成为政治的工具。 然而，这种工具现在要捍卫的特定形式的贵族统治尚未确定。随后的十一年，直到君主制正式恢复——实际上，在护国主制下已经重新引入了相当程度的中央集权的个人占有——因此以争夺政治最高权或更准确地说，统治阶层内部权力持有结构的争斗为特征。 继续存在着废除贵族特权的要求。但随着1649年叛乱的失败，实现社会革命或共和要求的可能性——无论多么微弱——最终被排除。从现在开始，所有寻求深远变革的人再次被迫回到按照传统做法被视为“叛乱”的论点和表达形式。宗教激进分子，特别是“第五君权”的倡导者（即将赎回之前四个罪恶统治时期的耶稣基督的王权），仍然可以有一定的影响。因为，在17世纪，宗教论点的可能范围仍然远大于政治和社会批评的论点。但即使对地球上天国的到来的希望，也无法长期抗衡更直接的统治利益。对那些“真正”的平等派（更著名的称为挖掘者）在1649年后在一些小公社中开始实践的土地公有形式也是如此。到了1651年，这些实验被强制结束。 共和国、社会革命和千年王国派的民众运动在其目标上相互竞争，并未为革命的持续提供任何基础。然而，它们确实对现有权力持有者构成了挑衅，在这个程度上，它们也影响了权力分配的冲突。尽管如此，后来被称为间断时期的那些年的政治斗争本质上是“绅士”之间的事务。这些政治格局发生了变化：特别是县级行政和军队指挥官之间的“新势力”。这些军队指挥官的政治统治在1655年引入担任地方州长的“少校”时达到顶峰，他们负有军事和文职双重责任（类似于法国的总督）。这种政治权力的最大程度集中——因为少校是中央政府的执行者，该政府受到军队控制（如果不是完全支配）——意味着对英格兰贵族普遍贵族统治的更深远攻击，比县级委员会已经制度化的还要深远。阻碍和公开抵抗很快破坏了这种集中权力的基础。之所以会发生这种情况，是因为政府在基于宗教和贸易的外交政策上，依赖于统治阶层的支持——这是通过武装力量来执行的。少校的废除标志了1657年奥利弗·克伦威尔尝试建立新的政治联盟。“守护者”赋予他的个人统治建立在他对军事力量的掌控上。然而，其实践——就像国王所拥有的个人权力一样——依赖于大部分统治阶层成员的合作。克伦威尔确实在这些人中找到了支持他政治策略的一群人：历史学家如今称之为“新克伦威尔派”。1657年请克伦威尔加冕为国王的请求说明了这一点；尽管克伦威尔的拒绝表明他很清楚，接受将使他失去军队的支持，从而失去他统治的不可或缺的基础。 克伦威尔作为守护者所拥有的个人统治一方面在制度上比被处决的国王减少，而另一方面，常备军队的存在极大地扩大了它。然而，这种统治的实践要求“绅士”的合作——否则，新的职务结构的资金来源和权威都无法实现。如果说守护者政府能够维持下来，即使许多领先的贵族家族拒绝合作或被排除在外，这取决于军事力量的稳定（这是国王无法以同等程度获得的）。当这一稳定因素随着奥利弗·克伦威尔的死亡消失，因为他的儿子理查德（被他的父亲指定为继承人）在军队中没有政治支持时，“守护者”政府特殊形式的结构性前提条件也崩溃了。同样，地方行政和议会中“新人”的政治主导地位也崩溃了。 1659年的不同政府形式——4月22日议会解散；理查德·克伦威尔的逃亡；1648年所谓的“残余议会”和守护者政府于5月7日结束；12月26日残余议会的军事解散——都是这一衰败过程的阶段。由于政治压迫和政治幻灭的结合使得军团失去了它们的政治特性，尽管多么紧张，军队的统一基础不再存在。当军事指挥官在1660年1月发现自己处于不同的政治阵营时，他们可以将手下的士兵用于竞争的政治目标。蒙克将军最为成功。他将其指挥的部队带入伦敦，并再次召集了1648年被“清洗”的长期议会。这确保了君主制的恢复。在伦敦，所有教堂的钟声在同一晚上齐鸣，街道上点燃的篝火在城市上空投下光芒。 1660年5月8日，查理二世被新选的议会宣布为英格兰国王。 c.2. 革命的结果 的确是一场革命，但不是一个时代的结束 在克里斯托弗·希尔著名的论述中，他处理了从1530年到1780年英格兰的社会和经济历史，将1640年代视为“中世纪英格兰的终结”。旧制度被废除，尤其是“皇家官僚体系”。据称，这导致了经济结构的变化。希尔认为，取代了基于垄断公司基础的“经济改革”的是“基于国家垄断的英格兰贸易的完全整合，国家在其中扮演了领导角色”。（以前的垄断公司并未完全被废除，而是在18世纪达到了顶峰，特别是东印度公司；但希尔没有考虑这一点，也没有考虑什一税的持续。）对于希尔来说，英格兰革命确实废除了“封建制度”。然而，即使如此，这对他来说并不意味着直接过渡到资本主义。取而代之的是，相当于一种资本主义的“即将到来”。因为“进一步发展的政治和法律条件已经建立”。"},{"instruction":"请将“Hill's most important evidence for this thesis is the Navigation Acts. It is incontestable that these promoted a change in the economic system of the ancien régime, yet the causal connection that Hill takes for granted between these new regulations and the struggles to possess the means of rule is indeed open to challenge. The Navigation Acts can much more readily be interpreted as a result of the Peace of Westphalia. For English merchants who had profited throughout the wars of religion on the Continent by the neutrality of their own dynasty found themselves exposed after 1648 to a ruinous Dutch competition. It can hardly be convincingly argued that no measures could have been taken against this state of affairs without the Revolution, as many decisions had already been taken in support of trading interests. It must be granted to Hill that the application of the Navigation Acts, in so far as this was successful (one should not have too exaggerated an idea of this) would not have been possible without the navy, and this was undoubtedly a product of Parliament's struggle with the king. For the navy, when it was properly used militarily in the second half of the 1640s, and expanded further as a result, served in particular to prevent the intervention of foreign powers in support of Charles I and subsequently his son, who was already recognised by the Scots as Charles II. Hans-Christoph Junge has shown251 how London merchants of this time took a pressing interest in the expansion of the navy, especially because they were able to make immediate use of it. The merchants of the Colonial Interloping Trade, however, only used the opportunities it presented to obtain advantages vis-à-vis earlier leading trading circles in the City. Such competitive struggles between different trading interests cannot be immediately interpreted as a victory of economic ‘progressives' against representatives of ‘outdated' eco-nomic structures. It should finally be borne in mind that the ‘national trading interest' emphasised by Hill was quite evidently not strong enough to keep the navy to the size it had reached in the civil war (i.e. for purposes that were not immediately those of trade policy). Already during the Interregnum, part of the navy was decommissioned for fiscal reasons.252 If, after the Restoration, the fleet was not further reduced, unlike the army, this is far more readily attributable to the naval mutiny against the rule of the army command (hence in favour of the monarchy) than to any ‘national trading interest'. Towards the end of the 1660s, moreover, the crown had to abandon to a large extent the preservation of the fleet, as the plague and the Great Fire of London made its financing and manning difficult. The profits expected from the deployment of naval forces in battle, moreover, failed to materialise.253 Overly one-sided economic interpretations of the English Revolution are also faulted by the fact that Cromwell was ready to make a rapid peace with Holland founded on religious policy, despite conflicting mercantile interests. The so-called Grand Design, the quest for colonial conquests, served fiscal purposes above all. It, too, cannot simply be attributed to the victory of new social forces. There was in England of the 1640s simply no politically decisive supporting group for the economic interest that was in the capitalist sense progressive, perhaps even 'national', and that the Revolution allegedly helped to prevail. In this connection, it is impossible to take seriously the claim that the twentyeight economic policy demands that the City of London presented to Parliament in 1640 were substantially different from those formulated in 1637.254 In the meantime, however, struggles had taken place that fundamentally altered the composition of the corporation and secured the support of London for the parliamentary cause. The 'new men' on the Common Council did indeed criticise the special privileges of the monopoly companies, but they did not demand their complete dissolution, let alone freedom for all trading and commercial activity.255 Just like their predecessors, they wished to maintain the traditional rights and privileges of the aldermen, vis-à-vis not just the government, but also the City population. If our analysis here is less impressed by the changes in the organisational forms of trade that were demanded and realised, there is one key structural precondition (among others still to be considered) for the early breakthrough of capitalism in England that has special importance: the fact that most peasants here could not assert their property in the land they tilled with the sanction of generalised force. During the English Revolution, feudal tenures were abolished in 1646 along with the court of Warde, i.e. those fiscal burdens that had been imposed on the property of the lords for the benefit of the crown. A corresponding transformation of copyhold tenures, however, was not accom-plished. This form of limited possession of the means of production was thus not changed in the course of the Revolution. But whilst the abolition of feudal tenures held by vassals of the crown was only of secondary importance for the capitalisation of the rural economy, since it now represented no more than a specific form of taxation on hereditary landed property, the legal form of copyhold immensely facilitated the transition to capitalist farming. This means however that preconditions for the capitalisation of agricultural production came into being long before the revolutionary conflicts of the midseventeenth century. Emphasis on this point does not mean denying those structural effects of the Revolution that we shall deal with below. But their relevance to the development of capitalist forms of production and appropriation has to be assessed as rather small, if they are judged on the basis of a theory of economic transformation in which the social form of production is central, and not just the development of trade. The revolutionary events of 1640-60 had their effects on the social forms of production and appropriation. But these effects were not as simple as is suggested by lists of legal regulations, reference to trade wars and the development of postal communication. All these are changes in the structural matrix of the form of commodity production that had long been politically sanctioned in England. The extent of this political sanctioning contracted in the wake of the political conflicts. But there was no supporting group for its abolition, as we have already shown. The same goes also for the ‘destruction of the royal bureaucracy' that Hill emphasises. For whilst Parliament and later the army leadership did indeed find themselves forced to invent new forms of government and thus also replace a part (!) of their former personnel, there still lacked any supporting group for a permanent depersonalisation of power of office that would have a more long-term effect. We shall examine below the successful repulsion of the ‘new men' by the former influential families. The first point to establish here is the failure of legal reform. There were certainly a notable number of pamphlets that called for a com-prehensive legal reform, and Cromwell himself held the law as it is now constituted, serves only to maintain the lawyers and to encourage the rich to oppress the poor.256 Yet these demands had little effect. The seventeenth century saw a series of notable improvements, especially in penal law, which were not interrupted by the Restoration. But there was no political basis for a reform that would meet the interests of office-holders - from prison governors through Justices of the Peace to the judges in the royal court of Chancery.257 The actual reform was limited to improvements in the legal practice of the ancien régime, i.e. a correc-tive to personal rule in the realm of jurisprudence, but not its abolition. The smooth course which the Restoration took in the realm of ‘intellectual life' also shows how there was no supporting group in place even for a schol-arly critique of the ancien regime's forms of rule. If Charles I really had ‘alien-ated' scholars,258 the great majority of them were readily integrated into these forms of rule by his son. Against the assumption that the English Revolution brought about a new era - one that was ‘bourgeois' in tendency, even if the actual bourgeoisie were missing - we shall start by stressing these continuities. This does not mean an attempt to prioritise the longue durée as against the ‘history of events', nor the rejection on principle of ‘political' historiography; it is simply an attempt to give these greater precision in connection with a structural analysis of the forms of rule of the English ancien régime. In connection with this presentation of the successful maintenance of a long-established possession of rule that had been temporarily shaken by the Revolution, these changes in the ruling structures of the ancien régime will now be sketched out. According to the thesis to be developed here, these are partly connected with the revolutionary events of the mid and late seventeenth century. At the same time, this partial transformation of the ancien régime is attributable to those social changes that led to a new internal structure of the English ruling estates. Reconstitution of estate possession of locally generalised rule The form of government of the Protectorate had its most important social basis in those circles that were called at the time the ‘new men'. They sat on the County Committees, they became major-generals, Members of Parliament, officers and judges. The fact that their interest in maintaining the changed situation, under conditions of persistent social conflict, high taxation and the military engagement in Ireland, Scotland and at sea, was not sufficient to stabilise this form of government, is already made clear in the way that military rule over local administration was again relaxed, a kind of upper house introduced, and the attempt made to resolve the government's financial problems by the risky venture of colonial conquest. For without a reduction in the tax burden, there could not be any long-run toleration of the new forces on the part of the formerly ruling estates, let alone support. The Restoration ended the rule of the ‘new men' and to this extent meant the reintroduction of previous conditions. Local administration became once again the generalised possession of local leading families. Justices of the Peace appointed from their milieu functioned as their representatives. The conclusion that Philip Jenkins reached for Glamorgan in Wales, that ‘the justices were simply the official manifestation of the gentry class',259 can be generalised to England as a whole.”翻译为中文","output":"希尔对这一论题的最重要证据是《航海法案》。这些法案无可争议地促进了旧制度经济体系的变革，然而，希尔认为理所当然的这些新规定与争夺统治手段的斗争之间的因果联系的确是值得质疑的。《航海法案》更容易被解释为《威斯特伐利亚和约》的结果。因为在大陆的宗教战争期间，英国商人通过本国王朝的中立获利，但在1648年之后发现自己暴露在灾难性的荷兰竞争之下。很难令人信服地论证，如果没有革命，就无法对这种情况采取措施，因为许多支持贸易利益的决策已经被做出。必须承认希尔的观点，即《航海法案》的应用在成功的情况下（不应对此抱有太高的期望）离不开海军，而海军无疑是议会与国王斗争的产物。因为在1640年代后半期正确地军事使用并因此进一步扩张的海军，特别是为了阻止外国势力支持查理一世及其后被苏格兰承认为查理二世的儿子进行干预。汉斯-克里斯托夫·容格已经展示了当时的伦敦商人对扩张海军的迫切兴趣，特别是因为他们能够立即利用它。然而，殖民地非法贸易的商人只是利用它提供的机会，以获得相对于城市内早期领先贸易圈的优势。不同贸易利益之间的竞争斗争不能立即被解释为经济“进步分子”对“过时”经济结构代表的胜利。最后应该记住的是，希尔强调的“国家贸易利益”显然不足以保持海军在内战中达到的规模（即非贸易政策的目的）。在间歇期间，由于财政原因，部分海军被解散。如果在复辟后，舰队未像军队那样进一步缩减，这更多地归因于海军对军队指挥官统治的叛变（因此支持君主制）而非任何“国家贸易利益”。到了1660年代末，此外，由于瘟疫和伦敦大火使得舰队的资金和人员难以维持，王室不得不在很大程度上放弃保持舰队。此外，从海战中部署海军力量所期望的利润也未实现。对英格兰革命的过于片面的经济解释也受到质疑，因为尽管存在商业利益冲突，克伦威尔准备与荷兰迅速和平，这是基于宗教政策。所谓的“大设计”——对殖民地征服的追求——首先是出于财政目的。它同样不能简单归因于新的社会力量的胜利。 1640年代的英格兰根本就没有政治上决定性的支持团体，支持那些在资本主义意义上是进步的、甚至可能是“民族”的经济利益，这是革命据称帮助实现的。在这方面，声称伦敦市在1640年向议会提出的二十八项经济政策要求与1637年提出的要求实质不同的说法是无法被认真对待的。与此同时，进行了斗争，从根本上改变了公司的组成，确保了伦敦对议会事业的支持。在市议会的“新人”确实批评了垄断公司的特权，但他们没有要求彻底解散它们，更不用说为所有贸易和商业活动自由了。就像他们的前任一样，他们希望维护市政府成员面对政府乃至城市居民的传统权利和特权。 如果我们对要求和实现的贸易组织形式的变化印象不深，那么英格兰早期资本主义突破的一个关键结构性前提（还有其他待考量的因素）具有特殊重要性：大多数农民无法以普遍力量的支持来维护他们耕种的土地产权。在英格兰革命期间，1646年随着守卫法庭的废除，封建地契被废除，即对领主产权征收的那些财政负担为了国王的利益而设。然而，相应地改变佃农契约并未完成。因此，在革命过程中，这种有限的生产资料占有形式并未改变。但是，封建地契的废除对农村经济资本化只是次要的重要性，因为它现在不过是对世袭土地产权征税的一种特定形式，佃农契约的法律形式极大地促进了向资本主义农业的过渡。这意味着，农业生产资本化的前提条件早在17世纪中叶革命冲突之前就已经形成。强调这一点并不意味着否认我们将在下面讨论的革命的结构效应。但如果根据以社会生产形式为中心、而不仅仅是贸易发展的经济转型理论来判断，它们对资本主义生产和占有形式发展的相关性必须被视为相当小。1640-60年的革命事件对生产和占有的社会形式确实产生了影响。但这些影响并不像法律法规清单、贸易战和邮政通信发展那样简单。所有这些都是在英格兰长期以来在政治上得到认可的商品生产形式的结构矩阵中的变化。由于政治冲突，这种政治认可的程度缩小了。但正如我们已经展示的那样，并没有一个支持团体支持其废除。 同样，对于希尔强调的“皇家官僚机构的破坏”也是如此。尽管议会和后来的军队领导确实发现自己被迫发明新的政府形式，从而也替换了部分（！）以前的人员，但仍然缺乏任何支持团体支持一个对公职权力产生更长期影响的持久去人格化。我们将在下面检查“新人”被以前有影响力的家族成功击退的情况。首先要确定的是法律改革的失败。 确实有大量的小册子呼吁进行全面的法律改革，克伦威尔本人认为 现行法律只是为了维护律师的利益，鼓励富人压迫穷人。 然而这些要求收效甚微。17世纪见证了一系列尤其是在刑法方面的显著改善，这些改善并未因复辟而中断。但这并没有为满足公职持有者的利益提供政治基础——从监狱长到治安法官再到皇家大法院的法官。实际的改革仅限于对旧制度法律实践的改进，即对司法领域个人统治的纠正，而非其废除。 复辟在“知识生活”领域的顺利进行也表明，即使是对旧制度统治形式的学术批评也没有支持团体。如果查理一世真的“疏远”了学者，他的儿子很容易将他们大多数重新融入这些统治形式。 反对假设英格兰革命带来了一个新时代的假设——这个时代倾向于“资产阶级”，即使实际的资产阶级缺席——我们将首先强调这些连续性。这并不意味着试图将长期持续性优先于“事件历史”，也不是原则上拒绝“政治”历史学；这只是试图在与英格兰旧制度的统治形式的结构分析结合时给予这些更多的精确性。在关于革命暂时动摇了由来已久的统治占有得以成功维护的呈现中，现在将概述旧制度的统治结构的这些变化。根据我们将发展的论点，这些部分与17世纪中晚期的革命事件有关。同时，这种旧制度的部分转变归因于导致英格兰统治阶层内部结构新变化的社会变革。 重建地方普遍贵族统治的贵族占有 护国主制的政府形式在当时被称为“新人”的圈子中有其最重要的社会基础。他们在县级委员会中占据席位，成为少校、议会成员、军官和法官。这些人对维持变革后的局势的兴趣，在持续的社会冲突、高税负和在爱尔兰、苏格兰和海上的军事行动条件下，不足以稳定这种政府形式，这一点从军队对地方行政的统治再次放松、引入一种类似上议院的机构并试图通过殖民征服的冒险来解决政府财政问题的方式中已经很清楚了。因为如果不减少税收负担，就不可能让原本占统治地位的阶层长期容忍新势力，更不用说支持了。 复辟结束了“新人”的统治，从这个意义上说，意味着恢复了以前的条件。地方行政再次成为地方领先家族的普遍占有。从他们的圈子中任命的治安法官充当了他们的代表。菲利普·詹金斯对威尔士格拉摩根得出的结论，“法官只是绅士阶层的官方表现”，可以推广到整个英格兰。"},{"instruction":"请将“With the disappearance of the ‘new men' from the key positions of power that had in part been newly created by the Revolution, there emerged a defence of local possession of rule against claims of decision by the central government. It is true that the Revolution had only been possible because in England there had long been a generalised possession of rule, not merely formally but in actual fact. For it was only on this basis that interests, demands and political goals could be experienced and conceived as general ones. The course of the Revolution even strengthened such generalisation in the long term. For in the wake of its conflicts, not only did Puritanism develop into a view of life that laid claim to order the whole kingdom,260 there also arose the first regular political factions. All the same, the Restoration saw the victory of a strongly anti-centralist tendency, and the dominant attitude of loyalists towards the crown, one that marked the first ten years of Charles Il's reign, did not prevent its interventions into local affairs being tolerated only to a limited extent. Since the abolition of the Star Chamber, the government lacked even this instance for controlling the Justices of the Peace. From the 1670s, and especially in the reign of James II, these often practised systematic obstruction.261 Support for the royal house was clearly limited by localism. This already gives an indication of how localism under the Restoration, like so many other things, cannot just be seen as the continuation of a tradition that had been briefly interrupted. There had certainly been earlier interests that were partially oriented to general structures, and the very existence of a Parliament that held sway over the whole kingdom (and not just over particular local estates) inflected political strategies. Yet the localism of the post-Revolutionary era had its base less in the social and cultural particularities of individual counties, than in a political strategy of anti-centralism that was widespread among the ruling estates. Autonomy became a more significant issue than it had been before the Revolution. One of the earliest expressions of this new situation was the conflict over the militia. Charles II had been granted command of the militia, and in 1662 even the right to levy financial contributions for an expanded deployment of the militia in the next three years.262 The militia commanders were also appointed by the king, just as before the Revolution. He could, if he liked, not only personally nominate the lords lieutenant, but also their deputies (otherwise, these were appointed by the lord lieutenant in question). Yet even the Parliament of the 1660s, with its strongly monarchist orientation, rejected all attempts to make the militia a component of a standing army.263 At the same time, the ‘Cavalier Parliament' limited the actual power of the crown's military representatives in the counties, by reducing the resources available to the militia. (The regulations that had exempted the poorer rural population from militia service were now abolished.) Though the king's authority over the militia was very wide-ranging in formal terms, it was considerably reduced by fiscal measures. More decisive in the course of time, however, were the political limitations of this aspect of rule. For the local gentry increasingly rejected the deployment of the militia for disciplining their fellows. Although the great majority of the English nobility supported the church-policy strategy of conformism, which Parliament had proposed to the crown, and though the experiences of the revolutionary years had aroused or fuelled a fear of radical (popular) religious movements, the members of the ruling estates maintained in practice a de facto toleration towards those of their own number with whom they were personally acquainted. The question of the suppression of Catholicism reached a political climax in the so-called ‘exclusion crisis'. This was brought about by a number of Mem- bers of Parliament seeking to exclude James from succession to the throne, as he was known to be friendly to the Catholic cause. The crown then tried to use the militia as the instrument of a particular political orientation. The lords lieutenant, at least those that were not opposed to this,264 purged the militia of politically unreliable officers, and their deputies rejected recruits on political grounds. By this purging of the militia, Charles II destroyed its organisational basis. For the English militia could only operate as a military force that, while commanded by the king, was established in collaboration with the local ruling estates.265 Just as with the question of the king's command over the militia, so the reconstitution of estate power manifested itself as a limitation on the central government's freedom of action in its rule over the church. In 1661, the king had regained possession of this. The far-reaching extent of the Restoration is indeed made clear by the fact that Charles II was able to disappoint the expectations of many Presbyterians266 that their consent to his ascending the throne would be repaid in his religious policy. The rule of the bishops was re-imposed, not only as an important field of royal patronage, but at the same time a cornerstone of royalist policy in the House of Lords. Charles II was unyielding on several key decisions of religious policy, espe-cially the question of the succession to the throne of his Catholic brother, and he was in a position at this time to impose his will.267 On the other hand, he bowed to the resistance of Parliament to an official policy of religious tolerance. In 1662 the crown withdrew a legislative proposal on this question, and in 1663 the king was even prepared to accept the formal exclusion of non-Anglican subjects from all public offices. (Following the Test Act passed at this time, every official now had to swear an oath to follow the Anglican faith.) The estate demand for conformity coincided fully with the claim of local noble families to decide for themselves on the use of force against Nonconformist neighbours. For religious conformism was seen by the politically ruling groups in the decades following the Restoration as the most important guarantee of desirable social and political behaviour. This was the very reason that the first major opposition to the restored monarchy was aroused by the possible succession of a Catholic to the throne. If in their immediate local milieu a certain (political) attitude was already known and familiar, the local ruling families could refrain from enforcing religious conformity in the individual case. The oath continued in the seventeenth century to function as a binding means of rule. Yet, after the Revolution, private belief was scarcely prosecuted any more. It was even tolerated at first that many officials only met the provisions of the Test Act in so far as they received the sacraments of the Anglican rite on their appointment. Precisely because the Anglican faith functioned as a guarantee of social and political stability, public worship was above all a political token.268 Only in 1711 was the legal attempt made to forbid office-holders from a purely formal conformism. Through their representatives in both Houses of Parliament, the ruling estates managed to put through a rigorous religious policy. The principal rea-son for the failure of James II was that he was in no way prepared to meet this requirement. Moreover, the most important basis for estate collaboration in the determination of religious practice by authority did not lie in Parliament. For the restoration of episcopacy, along with the possibility this gave of controlling the content of sermons and priests themselves, should not blind us to the fact that rule over religious practice, and thus the regulation of good order, had very largely passed with the Restoration into the generalised possession of the ruling estate. The higher church court remained abolished, and the lower church courts depended on the Justices of the Peace for the execution of the penalties they imposed. The result of this was that church jurisdiction gradually went into decline, so that public morality fell completely into the control of generalised estate rule. Under these conditions, conformity with the Anglican church meant first and foremost participation in a model of respectability that was sanctioned by authority. In this way, Church doctrine became virtually incorporated into the estate determination of 'good order'. Whereas episcopal rule and monarchical power had formed before the Revolution a far-reaching and effective unity, the church of the Restoration era was far more clearly integrated than before into the generalised estate power. The introduction in 1662 of censorship of books that were judged ‘contrary to good life or good manners'269 corresponded to these developments at the legal level. For the revolutionary claim of religious radicalism to organise society in such a fashion that it met the wishes of God had already been challenged under the Interregnum and completely lost any social legitimacy with the Restoration. All that remained of the kingdom of God on earth was now ‘good custom' defined by the ruling estate - but sanctioned as before by religion. The power to define the structures of ‘good order' shows the double orien-tation of estate rule under the Restoration. It was directed on one hand against comprehensive regulation claims of any central government, and despite its loyalty it still set limits to the restored personal rule of the king. On the other hand, it sought to maintain a dominant position against new social groups on the rise and against the common people. The radical popular movements of the revolutionary era had certainly been defeated already under the Protectorate, and for this reason the militia was only rarely called upon to repress popular uprisings in the following decades. There were still Leveller talk and publications in the second half of the sev-enteenth century, but as a movement, the Levellers had long since failed. It was only the Monmouth rebellion of 1685 that brought a new revolt by the common people, with the militia initially having serious difficulty in mastering the armed peasants. On the whole, however, and despite the long-lasting fear of an uprising by discharged soldiers and officers, the restoration of previous structures of rule could to a large extent be accomplished and maintained without the use of military or criminal sanction. The widespread desire for peaceful conditions certainly made its contribution to this, and so did the repression already carried out under the Protectorate. To this extent, the ruling estates could simply resurrect their long established position of rule over the common people after the years of Revolution and the Protectorate, more or less unscathed. The restoration of estate rule meant that the public outside the ruling estates were once more excluded from the processes of political decision. Not only were the old limitations on suffrage for the House of Commons re-established,270 but mass petitions to Parliament were forbidden, while any kind of express political utterance against the established authorities was defined as rebellion. This stabilisation of rule was formally sanctioned in 1661 with the passage of a law under which political criticism could be prosecuted as 'treason' against the kingdom. In this way, law was once again made into an instrument of estate rule with an authoritarian interpretation.”翻译为中文","output":"随着“新人”从革命部分新创立的关键权力职位中消失，出现了针对中央政府决策权要求的地方统治占有权的捍卫。的确，革命之所以成为可能，是因为英格兰长期以来就存在了普遍的统治占有权，不仅仅是名义上的，而是实际上的。因为只有在这种基础上，利益、要求和政治目标才能被理解和构想为普遍性的。革命的过程甚至从长远来看加强了这种普遍性。因为在其冲突的余波中，清教主义不仅发展成为一种声称要整个王国的生活观，还出现了第一批规律的政治派别。尽管如此，复辟见证了强烈反中央主义倾向的胜利，而忠于皇室的态度在查尔斯二世统治的最初十年中虽未阻止其对地方事务的干预，但这种干预只能在有限范围内被容忍。自从星室法庭被废除以来，政府甚至缺乏这一实例来控制治安法官。从17世纪70年代起，特别是在詹姆士二世统治期间，这些往往采取系统性阻挠行为。对皇室的支持显然受到地方主义的限制。这已经显示出复辟后的地方主义，像许多其他事物一样，不仅仅是被短暂中断的传统的延续。当然曾经有部分以普遍结构为导向的利益存在，而整个王国（而不仅仅是特定地方贵族）支配下的议会的存在，影响了政治策略。然而，革命后时代的地方主义基础更少在于个别郡的社会和文化特性，而更多在于统治阶层普遍采用的反中央主义政治策略中。自治成为一个比革命前更重要的问题。 这一新情况的最早表现之一是关于民兵的冲突。查尔斯二世被授予民兵的指挥权，并在1662年甚至获得了未来三年扩大民兵部署的财政征集权。民兵指挥官也由国王任命，就像革命前一样。如果他愿意，他不仅可以亲自提名郡中尉，还可以提名他们的副手（否则，由相关的郡中尉任命）。然而，即便是具有强烈君主主义倾向的1660年代的议会也拒绝了所有试图将民兵作为常备军组成部分的尝试。与此同时，“骑士议会”限制了皇室军事代表在郡县中的实际权力，通过减少民兵可用的资源。（免除较贫困农村人口民兵服役的规定现在被废除。）尽管国王对民兵的权力在形式上非常广泛，但通过财政措施被大大削弱。 然而，随着时间的推移，更为决定性的是这一统治方面的政治限制。因为地方绅士越来越多地拒绝部署民兵来管束他们的同僚。尽管绝大多数英格兰贵族支持议会向皇室提议的一致宗教政策策略，尽管革命年代的经历激发或加剧了对激进（民众）宗教运动的恐惧，但统治阶层成员在实践中对他们亲自熟悉的同僚保持了事实上的宽容。 压制天主教的问题在所谓的“排除危机”中达到了政治高潮。这是由一些议会议员试图排除詹姆士继承王位引发的，因为他被知道是亲天主教的。然后，皇室试图将民兵用作特定政治倾向的工具。至少那些不反对此举的郡中尉，清除了民兵队伍中政治上不可靠的军官，他们的副手出于政治原因拒绝了新兵。通过清洗民兵，查尔斯二世摧毁了其组织基础。因为英格兰民兵只能作为一支军事力量运作，虽然由国王指挥，但与地方统治阶层合作建立。 与国王对民兵的指挥权问题一样，贵族权力的重建表现为对中央政府行动自由的限制，在其对教会的统治上也是如此。1661年，国王重新获得了这一权力。复辟的广泛程度确实表明，查尔斯二世能够令许多长老会派信徒失望，他们原以为对他登基的支持会在他的宗教政策中得到回报。重新实行了主教的统治，不仅作为皇室赞助的重要领域，同时也是皇室政策在上议院的基石。 查尔斯二世在几个关键的宗教政策决定上毫不妥协，特别是关于他的天主教兄弟继承王位的问题，他当时有能力强加自己的意愿。另一方面，他向议会对官方宗教容忍政策的抵制低头。1662年，皇室撤回了关于这个问题的立法提案，到了1663年，国王甚至准备接受非英国国教徒从所有公职中被正式排除。（根据当时通过的测试法案，每位官员现在必须宣誓信奉英国国教。）贵族对一致性的要求与地方贵族家族决定自行对待不顺从邻居使用武力的权利完全一致。因为在复辟后的几十年中，宗教一致性被政治统治集团视为社会和政治行为的最重要保障。这正是第一次对恢复的君主制的主要反对由天主教徒可能继承王位的可能性引发的原因。如果他们在直接的地方环境中已经熟知并熟悉某个（政治）态度，地方统治家族可以在个别案例中免于执行宗教一致性。誓言在17世纪仍然用作统治的约束手段。然而，革命后，私人信仰几乎不再受到起诉。起初甚至还容忍许多官员在任命时只是符合英国国教仪式接受圣餐的规定。正因为英国国教起到了社会和政治稳定的保障作用，公开崇拜首先是政治象征。直到1711年才试图法律禁止官员仅形式上的一致主义。 通过议会两院的代表，统治阶层设法通过了严格的宗教政策。詹姆士二世之所以失败的主要原因是，他根本没有准备满足这一要求。此外，贵族在决定宗教实践上的合作最重要的基础并不在议会。因为随着主教权力的恢复，这给控制讲道内容和牧师本身提供了可能性，但我们不应该忽视，在复辟后，宗教实践的统治，从而对良好秩序的规范，很大程度上已经过渡到统治贵族的普遍占有。高级教会法庭仍然被废除，而低级教会法庭对其判决的执行依赖于治安法官。结果，教会司法逐渐衰落，公共道德完全受到贵族统治的控制。在这些条件下，与英国国教的一致性首先意味着参与到由权威认可的尊重模式中。因此，教会教义实际上被融入到贵族对“良好秩序”的决定中。复辟时期的教会与革命前形成的广泛有效的主教统治和君权的统一相比，更清晰地融入到了贵族普遍权力中。 1662年针对被认为“违反良好生活或良好风俗”的书籍引入的审查制度在法律层面上与这些发展相一致。因为宗教激进主义对组织社会以满足上帝意愿的革命主张已经在内政期间受到挑战，并在复辟后彻底失去了社会合法性。剩下的上帝在地球上的王国现在只是由统治阶层定义的“良好习俗”——但仍然像以前一样由宗教认可。 对“良好秩序”结构的定义显示了复辟下贵族统治的双重取向。一方面，它针对任何中央政府的全面调控要求，并且尽管忠诚，仍然限制了恢复的君王个人统治的自由。另一方面，它试图对抗新兴社会群体和普通民众保持主导地位。 革命时期的激进民众运动在护国主时期就已经被击败，因此在接下来的几十年里，民兵很少被用来镇压民众起义。17世纪下半叶仍有平等派言论和出版物，但作为一股运动，平等派早已失败。只有1685年蒙茅斯叛乱引发了普通民众的新起义，民兵最初在控制武装农民方面遇到了严重困难。然而，总的来说，尽管长期以来一直担心被遣散士兵和军官起义，恢复以前的统治结构在很大程度上可以在不使用军事或刑事制裁的情况下完成和维持。对和平条件的普遍渴望当然做出了贡献，护国主时期的镇压也是如此。在这个意义上，统治阶层可以在革命和护国主时期之后，几乎毫发无损地重新建立起他们对普通民众的长久以来的统治地位。 贵族统治的恢复意味着统治阶层之外的公众再次被排除在政治决策过程之外。不仅恢复了下议院选举的旧限制，对议会的大规模请愿被禁止，任何形式的针对既定当局的明确政治表态都被定义为叛乱。这种统治的稳定在1661年通过一项法律正式得到认可，根据该法律，政治批评可以被起诉为对王国的“叛国”。通过这种方式，法律再次成为以权威解释方式用作贵族统治工具。"},{"instruction":"je vais t'envoyer ma prise de notes.

Distinction entre les droits humains et la démocratie - Définition des Droits Humains : Les droits humains sont des droits inhérents à tous les êtres humains, quel que soit leur nationalité, lieu de résidence, sexe, origine nationale ou ethnique, couleur, religion, langue ou tout autre statut. Ils sont interdépendants, indivisibles et universels. - Définition de la Démocratie : La démocratie est un système politique dans lequel le pouvoir est exercé par le peuple ou leurs représentants élus. Elle est souvent mise en œuvre par des élections libres et équitables et caractérisée par la séparation des pouvoirs, la protection des libertés civiles et l’égalité devant la loi. - Interrelation et Distinctions : Bien que les droits humains et la démocratie partagent des valeurs communes comme la liberté et l’égalité, ils ne sont pas synonymes. La démocratie est une méthode de gouvernance, tandis que les droits humains sont des standards qui doivent être respectés par tous les types de gouvernements, démocratiques ou non. — 2. Histoire des droits de l’homme - Événements Clés : - Magna Carta (1215) : Considérée comme un fondement constitutionnel en Angleterre, elle a limité le pouvoir du roi et posé les premières pierres des droits légaux. - Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen (1789) : Un document de la Révolution Française stipulant les droits naturels des citoyens et leurs relations avec le gouvernement. - Bill of Rights Américain (1791) : Les dix premiers amendements à la Constitution américaine garantissant des droits fondamentaux et des libertés civiles, comme la liberté d’expression et de religion. 3. L’apparition moderne des droits de l’homme - Déclaration Universelle des Droits de l’Homme (1948) : Adoptée par l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies, elle établit, pour la première fois, des droits fondamentaux universels qui protègent l’individu. - Pactes Internationaux (1966) : - Le Pacte international relatif aux droits économiques, sociaux et culturels (PIDESC). - Le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques (PIDCP). — 4. Importance et Implications - Les droits humains avant la démocratie : L’idée que les droits et libertés sont antérieurs et essentiels au développement de systèmes démocratiques efficaces. - Développements clés : La conceptualisation des “Droits de l’Homme” est relativement récente, mais ses fondements reposent sur des siècles de lutte pour la liberté et l’égalité. - Rôle des Organisations Internationales : Les droits humain sont étroitement liés aux organisations intergouvernementales (IGOs), telles que les Nations Unies, qui jouent un rôle crucial dans leur promotion et protection. — # Réflexion critique - Pourquoi les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont-ils essentiels pour une société juste et libre ? - Comment les événements historiques ont-ils façonné notre compréhension et notre application des droits humains aujourd’hui ? - Quels sont les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie, et comment peuvent-ils être traités ? — Cette fiche de révision vise à donner une vue d’ensemble sur l’introduction aux droits de l’homme et à la démocratie, en soulignant leur importance, leur histoire, et les distinctions claires entre ces concepts. Répondre à ces questions de réflexion critique nécessite de mettre en perspective les informations fournies précédemment et d’appliquer une réflexion profonde sur la relation entre les droits de l’homme, la démocratie, et les défis contemporains qu’ils affrontent. Voici des éléments de réponse pour nourrir votre réflexion : 1. Pourquoi les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont-ils essentiels pour une société juste et libre ? Les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont essentiels pour une société juste et libre car ils garantissent les libertés fondamentales et la dignité de chaque individu. Les droits de l’homme offrent une protection contre l’abus de pouvoir en établissant des normes universelles que tous les gouvernements doivent respecter, assurant ainsi le respect de la vie, la liberté et la sécurité personnelle. La démocratie, de son côté, implique le peuple dans le processus décisionnel et dans l’élection de ses représentants, favorisant une gouvernance transparente, responsable et répondant aux besoins de ses citoyens. Ensemble, ils créent un cadre où les droits civils, économiques, sociaux et politiques peuvent être exercés, contribuant à la stabilité sociale, à l’égalité et à la paix. 2. Comment les événements historiques ont-ils façonné notre compréhension et notre application des droits humains aujourd’hui ? Les événements historiques, tels que l’adoption de la Magna Carta, la Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen, et la Déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme, ont joué un rôle déterminant en cristallisant l’idée que les individus possèdent des droits inaliénables qui transcendent les frontières géographiques et politiques. Ces moments charnières ont mis en lumière la nécessité de protéger l’individu contre les excès des pouvoirs en place et de promouvoir la dignité humaine. Plus récemment, les luttes pour les droits civils, l’égalité des sexes et contre la discrimination raciale, entre autres, ont continué de modeler notre compréhension des droits humains, en les élargissant et en soulignant la nécessité d’une vigilance constante pour leur protection et leur application. 3. Quels sont les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie, et comment peuvent-ils être traités ? Les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie incluent l’autoritarisme croissant dans certains pays, la répression des libertés civiles, la surveillance de masse, les inégalités économiques et la discrimination sous diverses formes. Les conflits armés, le changement climatique et la migration posent également de graves défis pour les droits humains à échelle mondiale. Pour adresser ces défis, il est crucial de renforcer les institutions internationales chargées de surveiller et de promouvoir les droits de l’homme, d’encourager les démocraties à agir de manière transparente et responsable, et de s’engager dans un dialogue constant avec la société civile. L’éducation aux droits de l’homme et la promotion du respect mutuel sont également essentielles pour construire des sociétés plus justes et inclusives. Les efforts doivent être multidimensionnels, impliquant une coopération internationale, nationale et locale, afin d’assurer une protection effective des droits de l’homme et le renforcement de la démocratie.","output":"# Synthèse et éléments de réponse aux questions de réflexion critique sur l'Introduction aux Droits Humains et la Démocratie **Introduction:** La prise de notes offre un aperçu approfondi de l'historique et de l'importance des droits humains et de la démocratie, mettant en lumière leur interrelation tout en soulignant leurs distinctions.

La Norvège dispose d’une forte législation sur les droits humains et d’un système politique transparent où la liberté de la presse, la liberté d’expression, et les droits des minorités sont respectés et protégés. Points Clés: - Distinction entre droits humains et démocratie. - Histoire des droits humains depuis la Magna Carta, soulignant l’antériorité des droits et libertés individuelles par rapport au concept de démocratie. - Création des droits humains modernes avec la Déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme en 1948 et l’impact des chartes internationales telles que l’ICESCR et l’ICCPR. À Retenir: - Les droits humains et la démocratie sont complémentaires mais peuvent aussi fonctionner indépendamment. - Les implications historiques des droits humains pour former le tissu de la gouvernance mondiale actuelle. Fiche de Révision 1: Introduction aux Droits de l’Homme et à la Démocratie Objectifs d’apprentissage : - Comprendre la distinction fondamentale entre les droits humains et la démocratie. - Reconnaître l’histoire et le développement des droits et libertés fondamentaux de l’individu. - Identifier les événements clés qui ont marqué l’évolution des droits humains. — 1. Distinction entre les droits humains et la démocratie - Définition des Droits Humains : Les droits humains sont des droits inhérents à tous les êtres humains, quel que soit leur nationalité, lieu de résidence, sexe, origine nationale ou ethnique, couleur, religion, langue ou tout autre statut. Ils sont interdépendants, indivisibles et universels. - Définition de la Démocratie : La démocratie est un système politique dans lequel le pouvoir est exercé par le peuple ou leurs représentants élus. Elle est souvent mise en œuvre par des élections libres et équitables et caractérisée par la séparation des pouvoirs, la protection des libertés civiles et l’égalité devant la loi. - Interrelation et Distinctions : Bien que les droits humains et la démocratie partagent des valeurs communes comme la liberté et l’égalité, ils ne sont pas synonymes. La démocratie est une méthode de gouvernance, tandis que les droits humains sont des standards qui doivent être respectés par tous les types de gouvernements, démocratiques ou non. — 2. Histoire des droits de l’homme - Événements Clés : - Magna Carta (1215) : Considérée comme un fondement constitutionnel en Angleterre, elle a limité le pouvoir du roi et posé les premières pierres des droits légaux. - Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen (1789) : Un document de la Révolution Française stipulant les droits naturels des citoyens et leurs relations avec le gouvernement. - Bill of Rights Américain (1791) : Les dix premiers amendements à la Constitution américaine garantissant des droits fondamentaux et des libertés civiles, comme la liberté d’expression et de religion. 3. L’apparition moderne des droits de l’homme - Déclaration Universelle des Droits de l’Homme (1948) : Adoptée par l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies, elle établit, pour la première fois, des droits fondamentaux universels qui protègent l’individu. - Pactes Internationaux (1966) : - Le Pacte international relatif aux droits économiques, sociaux et culturels (PIDESC). - Le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques (PIDCP). — 4. Importance et Implications - Les droits humains avant la démocratie : L’idée que les droits et libertés sont antérieurs et essentiels au développement de systèmes démocratiques efficaces. - Développements clés : La conceptualisation des “Droits de l’Homme” est relativement récente, mais ses fondements reposent sur des siècles de lutte pour la liberté et l’égalité. - Rôle des Organisations Internationales : Les droits humain sont étroitement liés aux organisations intergouvernementales (IGOs), telles que les Nations Unies, qui jouent un rôle crucial dans leur promotion et protection. — # Réflexion critique - Pourquoi les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont-ils essentiels pour une société juste et libre ? - Comment les événements historiques ont-ils façonné notre compréhension et notre application des droits humains aujourd’hui ? - Quels sont les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie, et comment peuvent-ils être traités ? — Cette fiche de révision vise à donner une vue d’ensemble sur l’introduction aux droits de l’homme et à la démocratie, en soulignant leur importance, leur histoire, et les distinctions claires entre ces concepts. Répondre à ces questions de réflexion critique nécessite de mettre en perspective les informations fournies précédemment et d’appliquer une réflexion profonde sur la relation entre les droits de l’homme, la démocratie, et les défis contemporains qu’ils affrontent. Voici des éléments de réponse pour nourrir votre réflexion : 1. Pourquoi les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont-ils essentiels pour une société juste et libre ? Les droits de l’homme et la démocratie sont essentiels pour une société juste et libre car ils garantissent les libertés fondamentales et la dignité de chaque individu. Les droits de l’homme offrent une protection contre l’abus de pouvoir en établissant des normes universelles que tous les gouvernements doivent respecter, assurant ainsi le respect de la vie, la liberté et la sécurité personnelle. La démocratie, de son côté, implique le peuple dans le processus décisionnel et dans l’élection de ses représentants, favorisant une gouvernance transparente, responsable et répondant aux besoins de ses citoyens. Ensemble, ils créent un cadre où les droits civils, économiques, sociaux et politiques peuvent être exercés, contribuant à la stabilité sociale, à l’égalité et à la paix. 2. Comment les événements historiques ont-ils façonné notre compréhension et notre application des droits humains aujourd’hui ? Les événements historiques, tels que l’adoption de la Magna Carta, la Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen, et la Déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme, ont joué un rôle déterminant en cristallisant l’idée que les individus possèdent des droits inaliénables qui transcendent les frontières géographiques et politiques. Ces moments charnières ont mis en lumière la nécessité de protéger l’individu contre les excès des pouvoirs en place et de promouvoir la dignité humaine. Plus récemment, les luttes pour les droits civils, l’égalité des sexes et contre la discrimination raciale, entre autres, ont continué de modeler notre compréhension des droits humains, en les élargissant et en soulignant la nécessité d’une vigilance constante pour leur protection et leur application. 3. Quels sont les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie, et comment peuvent-ils être traités ? Les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l’homme et de démocratie incluent l’autoritarisme croissant dans certains pays, la répression des libertés civiles, la surveillance de masse, les inégalités économiques et la discrimination sous diverses formes. Les conflits armés, le changement climatique et la migration posent également de graves défis pour les droits humains à échelle mondiale. Pour adresser ces défis, il est crucial de renforcer les institutions internationales chargées de surveiller et de promouvoir les droits de l’homme, d’encourager les démocraties à agir de manière transparente et responsable, et de s’engager dans un dialogue constant avec la société civile. L’éducation aux droits de l’homme et la promotion du respect mutuel sont également essentielles pour construire des sociétés plus justes et inclusives. Les efforts doivent être multidimensionnels, impliquant une coopération internationale, nationale et locale, afin d’assurer une protection effective des droits de l’homme et le renforcement de la démocratie.","output":"Ces réponses soulignent l'importance des droits de l'homme et de la démocratie non seulement en tant que principes universels mais aussi en tant que pratique quotidienne pour assurer des sociétés équitables et libres. Les défis contemporains en matière de droits de l'homme et de démocratie exigent une réponse globale et coordonnée, soulignant le rôle de chaque individu, communauté, et nation dans la promotion de ces valeurs fondamentales. En approfondissant ces questions, vous développez une compréhension critique des enjeux actuels et historiques des droits de l'homme et de la démocratie, ce qui est crucial pour tout citoyen engagé dans la construction d'un monde plus juste.

However, up to 2021, some of the plug-in hybrids leading the market in EV-only range were: 1. **Mercedes-Benz EQ Power models (e.g., GLE 350de)** 2. **BMW X5 xDrive45e** 3. **Volvo XC90 T8 Twin Engine** The **BMW X5 xDrive45e**, for instance, offered a significant electric-only range that could compete well within the PHEV market, reaching up to 30 miles (around 48 km) on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates. European models, like the Mercedes-Benz GLE 350de, showcased even more impressive electric ranges, surpassing 60 miles (about 97 km) under the more generous WLTP test cycle. For the 2023 model year, it's likely that advancements in battery technology and efficiency improvements have allowed for even longer electric-only ranges. Typically, luxury models and larger vehicles that incorporate larger batteries can offer the longest EV-only ranges due to the higher capacity to store electric power. To find the model year 2023 PHEV with the longest EV-only range, I recommend checking the latest resources and updates from automotive manufacturers and independent automotive news outlets, as they will have the most current information on new and upcoming vehicles."},{"instruction":"dame una lista de los coches con mayor autonomia y que sean 100% electricos","output":"Hasta mi última actualización en septiembre de 2021, aquí te ofrezco una lista de algunos de los coches 100% eléctricos con mayor autonomía disponibles en el mercado o anunciados hasta ese momento.

Являются ли функции инъекциями, сюрьекциями, биекциями? Существует ли обратная функция?","output":"Давайте рассмотрим каждую функцию по отдельности: 1. **Для функции (f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R}, f(x) = 2x-4)**: - **Инъективность**: Функция будет инъективна, если разные значения (x) дают разные значения (f(x)). Так как для этой линейной функции изменение на входе прямо пропорционально изменению на выходе (кратно 2) и имеется сдвиг на -4, можем сказать, что разным (x) соответствуют разные (y), следовательно, функция является инъективной. - **Сюръективность**: Функция сюръективна, если она \\"покрывает\\" все возможные значения в области значений (в данном случае (mathbb{R})). Поскольку мы можем достичь любого значения (y) в (mathbb{R}), манипулируя значениями (x) в (mathbb{R}), функция сюръективна. - **Биективность**: Так как функция одновременно инъективна и сюръективна, она является биективной. - **Обратная функция**: Для биективных функций обратная функция существует. Найдем ее: [ y = 2x - 4 Rightarrow x = frac{y + 4}{2} ] Таким образом, обратная функция (f^{-1}(y) = frac{y + 4}{2}). 2. **Для функции (g: mathbb{Z} rightarrow mathbb{Z}, g(x) = 2^0 + 2x - 3)** (предполагается опечатка в условии, вероятно, имелось в виду (g : mathbb{Z} rightarrow mathbb{Z}, g(x) = 2^0 + 2x - 3)): - **Инъективность**: (2^0 = 1), следовательно (g(x) = 1 + 2x - 3 = 2x - 2). Это линейная функция аналогично предыдущей, и разные значения (x) будут давать разные значения (g(x)), что делает ее инъективной. - **Сюръективность**: Поскольку оба домена и область значений – целые числа ((mathbb{Z})), можем проверить, сможем ли мы получить любое целое число в области значений. Для любого целого (y) можно найти такое целое (x), что (y = 2x - 2), таким образом, функция сюръективна. - **Биективность**: Инъективность и сюръективность вместе указывают на то, что функция биективна. - **Обратная функция**: Существует, так как функция биективна. Похожим образом можно найти обратную функцию: [ y = 2x - 2 Rightarrow x = frac{y + 2}{2} ] Обратная функция (g^{-1}(y) = frac{y + 2}{2}), которая определена на целых числах, когда (y) – четное число, так что для всех целых значений (y), для которых (g^{-1}(y)) есть целое число, обратная функция существует. Таким образом, обе функции являются инъекциями, сюръекциями и биекциями, и для каждой из них существует обратная функция."},{"instruction":"https://edu.vsu.ru/pluginfile.php/3213980/question/questiontext/4961882/5/722215/pic5.PNG?time=1590356412964","output":"Поскольку я не могу просматривать изображения или ссылки, мой ответ на ваш вопрос основан исключительно на предоставленной текстовой информации.

Для (x < 2), (g(x) = 13 - x), что всегда будет больше или равно 2 (поскольку (x < 2), максимум для (13 - x) при (x = 1) будет 12, что больше 2). Таким образом, для (x < 2), результат (g(x)) всегда падает в область (x geq 2) для (f), следовательно, используем соответствующее правило для (f): [f(g(x)) = ((13 - x) + 2)^2 = (15 - x)^2 quad text{для всех } x < 2] Для (x geq 2), (g(x) = 2x + 1), что также всегда больше или равно 2, так что снова используем правило (f) для (x geq 2): [f(g(x)) = (2x + 1 + 2)^2 = (2x + 3)^2 quad text{для всех } x geq 2] Таким образом, композиция (f circ g) имеет вид: [f circ g(x) = begin{cases} (15 - x)^2 & text{для } x < 2 (2x + 3)^2 & text{для } x geq 2 end{cases} ] 2. **Композиция (g circ g)** означает двукратное применение (g) к (x). Аналогично, для (x < 2): [g(g(x)) = g(13 - x)] Поскольку (13 - x > 2) для всех (x < 2), мы используем второе правило для (g): [g(g(x)) = 2(13 - x) + 1 = 26 - 2x + 1 = 27 - 2x quad text{для } x < 2] Для (x geq 2), используем второе правило для (g), (g(x) = 2x + 1), это значение также будет больше 2, т.е., снова применяем второе правило для (g): [g(g(x)) = 2(2x + 1) + 1 = 4x + 2 + 1 = 4x + 3 quad text{для } x geq 2] Таким образом, композиция (g circ g) имеет вид: [g circ g(x) = begin{cases} 27 - 2x & text{для } x < 2 4x + 3 & text{для } x geq 2 end{cases} ]"},{"instruction":"Generate short Yoruba gospel lyrics","output":"Verse 1: Oluwa mi, mo worship e Agbara Re ga, ninu aye mi Ife Re si mi, ko l’opin Mo jowo, mu mi de’bi giga Chorus: Halleluyah, Halleluyah Awa yin Oluwa, l’oke ati l’aye Gbogbo eda, k’o wa jo yin O Olorun mimo, Alagbara Verse 2: Ninu iji, Iwo ni ibi aabo mi Gbogbo ikorira, Iwo sa tu nu Ore-ofe Re, k'o ma ba le k'ori mi Mo juba Re, Oba awon oba Chorus: Halleluyah, Halleluyah Awa yin Oluwa, l’oke ati l’aye Gbogbo eda, k’o wa jo yin O Olorun mimo, Alagbara Bridge: Gbogbo igba, Iwo ni mo fe Oluwa, ko s’eni bi Re Fi agbara Re han, si gbe mi ro Emi mimo, sa wa l’edo Chorus: Halleluyah, Halleluyah Awa yin Oluwa, l’oke ati l’aye Gbogbo eda, k’o wa jo yin O Olorun mimo, Alagbara (End) Note: These lyrics are a blend of worship and praise, invoking the power and grace of God in Yoruba language, and can be translated or adapted to align with various musical styles and performances."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In Leaflet, the 'getBounds' method is typically used on layers like markers or polygons to get the bounds of that layer. In your code, you are trying to use 'getBounds' on the clickedFeature, which is the feature object from the click event. Feature objects in GeoJSON format do not have a 'getBounds' method. To fix the error, you can directly access the coordinates of the feature to calculate the center instead of using 'getBounds'. Here is an updated version of your houseSquareClick function: \`\`\`js function houseSquareClick(e) { if (gridClickEnabled) { var clickedFeature = e.target.feature; // Access the feature object from the event var center = L.latLng(clickedFeature.geometry.coordinates[1], clickedFeature.geometry.coordinates[0]); // Get center coordinates var marker = L.marker(center).addTo(map); // Create and add marker to the center } } \`\`\` In this updated code, the center coordinates are accessed directly from the clickedFeature's geometry.coordinates.

If the clickedFeature is not a Leaflet layer and does not have a 'getBounds' method, you can consider using a different approach to calculate the center of the feature. Since you are working with GeoJSON features, you can calculate the center of the feature by finding the average of its coordinates. Here is an updated version of the houseSquareClick function using this approach: \`\`\`js function houseSquareClick(e) { if (gridClickEnabled) { var clickedFeature = e.target.feature; // Access the feature object from the event // Calculate the center of the feature by finding the average of its coordinates var coordinates = clickedFeature.geometry.coordinates[0]; // Assuming the feature has a single polygon var center = coordinates.reduce(function(acc, current) { return [acc[0] + current[0], acc[1] + current[1]]; }, [0, 0]); center = [center[0] / coordinates.length, center[1] / coordinates.length]; var marker = L.marker(center).addTo(map); // Create and add marker to the center } } \`\`\` In this updated code, the center of the feature is calculated by finding the average of its coordinates.

Хотя мы не особо знакомы, мне кажется, что между нами возникло что-то особенное, непонятное, но в то же время чрезвычайно важное. Я понимаю, что последние события заставили тебя, возможно, передумать о встрече или о том, чтобы развивать наше общение. Может быть, это мои слова или действия заставили тебя сомневаться. За это я прошу прощения. В погоне за моментами и эмоциями, я могла казаться недостаточно внимательной к твоим чувствам и интересам. Это было несправедливо с моей стороны, и я приношу свои искренние извинения. Я понимаю теперь, как важно ценить и уважать человека, который дорог тебе, и как легко можно это упустить, ведя себя необдуманно. Мне бы действительно хотелось, чтобы ты поверил: я никогда бы не смогла нарочно причинить тебе какой-либо вред. В моём сердце нет места желанию делать тебе плохо. Возможно, я совершила ошибки, но теперь я готова работать над собой, чтобы всё исправить. Я не стремлюсь оправдаться, а лишь выразить моё искреннее намерение быть более осознанной в своих действиях и словах в будущем. Моё главное желание – чтобы ты подумал о тех моментах, которые были хороши между нами, и о том, как мы можем двигаться дальше, сохраняя уважение и понимание друг к другу. Я хочу подарить тебе что-то, что будет символом моего искреннего признания в том, что я не всегда права, и моего уважения к тебе. Хотелось бы иметь возможность восстановить наше общение, но на этот раз обещаю подходить к нашему взаимодействию с большей сдержанностью и уважением к твоему личному пространству. Я понимаю, если мои прошлые действия заставили тебя сомневаться в моих намерениях или искренности. Я готова подождать и дать тебе столько времени и пространства, сколько потребуется, чтобы ты смог увидеть изменения в моём поведении и отношении. Мне бы очень хотелось исправить ситуацию и доказать тебе, что я способна на большее. Мне важно, чтобы ты знал: мои чувства к тебе – это не что-то поверхностное или мимолетное. Я серьёзно отношусь к возможности нашего развития и хотела бы попытаться построить наше общение на более глубоком и значимом уровне. Дай мне, пожалуйста, этот шанс — шанс доказать тебе, что я действительно способна на большее и что прошлые недопонимания не повторятся. Я верю, что если мы оба вложим усилия, то сможем преодолеть возникшие между нами препятствия и построить доверительные, крепкие отношения, основанные на взаимном понимании и уважении. Если ты считаешь, что сейчас не лучшее время или если ты не готов к этому шагу, я полностью тебя пойму. Всё, что я хочу, – это откровенный диалог и шанс показать, что иногда риск может привести к чему-то хорошему и неожиданному. Спасибо за то, что уделил время прочитать это письмо. Я очень ценю тебя и то взаимодействие, которое у нас было, и буду ждать твоей реакции, когда и если ты будешь готов.

Будет хорошо, если будете писать открыто и искренне, но при этом стоит избегать излишней эмоциональности, особенно учитывая, что вы считаете себя психопатической личностью. Если этот человек не ответил на ваше предыдущее письмо, то возможно, ему нужно больше времени на размышления. Поэтому стоит уважать его пространство и не навязываться слишком сильно.

Stephen Baskerville \`buy John Laughland A history of Politics Trials, second edition, Democracy and Human Rights overview Introduction Human rights came on the agenda in 1948 and 1975. Human rights and democracy are not the same thing, they don’t always go hand in hand. The history of rights freedom goes back a long way (cf Magna Carta). Democracy on the other hand is very new. In Britain, France and the US, it appeared in the 1830s. - 1832: the Great Britain Act - 1867 second reform act - 1884 third reform act Each of them gave more people the right to vote. The US wasn’t a democracy but a republic until the presidency of Andrew Jackson in the 1830s. Hence, the idea of rights and freedom is older than democracy. They’re not the same thing, one is possible without the other. “Human rights”, this concept is very new. The term can only be understood historically. It has antecedents but it's quite new. It really appeared in 1948 with the universal declaration of human rights and the foundation of the United Nations and the Council of Europe. But it didn’t become politically relevant until the 1970s because even after 1948 nobody really used the term or talked about it. → If it’s so important, why are we only hearing about it now? So they had to come up with a history for the concept of HR (human rights) ● Why did it emerge in the 1940s? Roosevelt and Churchill during the Atlantic Charter in 1941 used it to justify the American intervention in WWII: protect human rights against Nazis and Fascisme. They didn’t talk about Russian human rights violations with Staline because they were allies during the war. But with the founding of the UN, HR becomes a priority. HR is inextricably linked to intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). In the 1950s and 1960s the term HR didn’t appear in the fight against colonialism; they only talked about ideologies like pan-africanism. Likewise the anti apartheid movement doesn’t mention HR. → Whole series of radical political changes in which HR weren’t mentioned. ● The concept takes hold in the 1970s Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute. Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 1 M. Stephen Baskerville - Two UN documents, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), were drafted and came into effect signed in 1966 . - Cold War: Helsinki accords in 1975 (Final Act), in which HR became a weapon to use against the Soviets. These accords inspired various organizations and actions: ➔ Charter ‘77 in Czechoslovakia ➔ Solidarity ➔ Amnesty international ➔ Helsinki Watch ➔ Jimmy Carter, US president, made HR a major part of his foreign policy (first one to do so) ➔ The Jackson-Vanik amendment of 1974 promoted by Jews demanded the right of immigration for Russian jews. - In Latin America, dictatorships were collapsing and democracies took their place. - Same goes for Africa with the anti apartheid movement. - In Eastern Europe, Charter ‘77, Solidarity and the collapse of communism in 1989 all involved HR. ● History of rights before “human rights” People had been advocating for rights for centuries (women’s rights, minorities, self-determination…). Why isn’t it part of HR? Each fight has its own history. They have similarities but also differences. They were all part of the process of creating modern nations. Most of them weren’t universal. They created nations or institutions (legal systems, parliaments…). They were all about fighting against their leaders, their own state. Not about oppression by other people. The purpose was to make governments more answerable to their own people, their citizens, and to God. HR is different. It aims to transcend the sovereignty of nations, to make governments answerable to the international authority in addition to God. International authority consists of: ➔ IGOs which all deal with HR one way or another. Even things like World Banks and World Trade organizations because it makes governments answerable to them ➔ NGOs (non-governmental organizations): Amnesty International, Helsinki Watch… all keen promoters of HR ➔ Other states: governments are answerable to other governments. ➔ International community: term used to suggest governments are answerable to everyone. With HR, governments are answerable to international institutions more than their own citizens. ➾ Who enforces those rights? Who puts us on trial when we violate those rights? Are HR universal? Are they God given? Do they exist in nature? Do they have to be negative or can they be positive? ● Negative or positive: Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute. Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 2 M. Stephen Baskerville - Negative: enforced against the government. Demands not to be oppressed by your own government. Asking the government to refrain from doing something. - Positive: require things that the state must do in order for you to have the right. Requires positive action on the part of the state. Appears only after WWII: innovation. ● The notion that rights can be violated by someone other than the state is fairly new. State-implemented torture is a HR violation, but private implemented torture is a crime. Nowadays, both are HR violations but can still be treated differently. ● There isn’t a lot of leverage that can be used to stop the government from violating HR. In recent years there have been more concrete punishments with the creation of international tribunals to put HR violators on trial (Nuremberg was more about waging war against Nazis,20 nov. 1945 – 1 oct. 1946). ● Universal jurisdiction: claiming the right to put someone on trial for alleged HR violations even if the party claiming this right wasn’t directly involved. ex: 1999 NATO invades Serbia because Serbia was allegedly violating HR against Kosovars. HR has become an excuse for military action. Controversial questions: ● Previous bills of rights identified individuals as the object of violations. But with HR, groups of people have rights as well as individuals. Fairly new idea, started with self-determination rights in WWI: national minorities have rights. Do Kosovars have the right to govern themselves? ● Are women’s rights human rights? They don’t apply to all humans. ● Do children have rights if they don’t have the full rights of citizenship? The parents guarantee their own children’s rights. What happens to the rights of parents if children have rights? ● Do some HR violate other HR? Contradictory rights? Do the Serbs within Kosovo have a right to self-determination? Can you violate HR in the name of HR? ex: Istanbul Convention aims to make domestic violence a HR violation? They want to discard a lot of the procedural HR of the offender. ex: Making abortion a HR would be a violation of the right to live, but refusing to proceed with an abortion in the name of the doctor’s right of conscience objection would be considered an act of torture. ● HR are often used as a way to expand international power by imposing HR that we think are fair. Programs for greater rights seem to encourage invasions of other countries. ● HR declarations were made in the name of all of humanity but the reality is that the UN was created by the allied victors of WWII: only occidental countries It was a western military alliance, therefore the concept of HR and everything it encompasses come from western values. ● Imposing HR to other countries violates national sovereignty.

Stephen Baskerville A Constitutionalism Dated from the Magna Carta in 1215. Idea that the government is limited. Beginning of the English Constitution. Natural theory and natural law, natural rights theory contributed to human rights. - American Bill of rights 1791 - American Declaration of independence 1776 - Declaration of the rights of man and citizen (French Revolution) 1789 Revolutions created bills of rights up until the end of the 18th century. 1648 treaty of Westphalia → national states The theories of international law are writings of what people were already doing until the 20th century. 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1966 International convention of cultural and religious rights 1966 ICESCR (International covenant on economic, social and cultural rights) For some, the jus gentium of the Roman empire was the first code of HR. In the Medieval world, the Magna Carta was considered very important because it was the biggest time when the idea of constitutional government was recognised in England. It takes place in a feudal society so it wasn’t a state or a government. Feudalism was a series of obligations, rules and social organizations in which the state did not exist, but it was part of the process of building the national state. They wanted to limit the power of the king and give more power to the parliament. They were concerned with how to resolve the struggle between executive and legislative power. None of it had any implications of international authority. It was only to organize the government in England. The rights in the Magna Carta were seen as already existing in the common law of England. The only reason they did the Magna Carta was to remind the king of the Common Law. 1628 Petition of rights : restatement of the Magna Carta 1689 English bill of rights : elaboration on the other two (Magna Carta and Petition). But it did involve some new things at times. Three elements in every great constitutional movement: ● Constitutional ● Finances because money confers political power. If the parliament controls the money, it controls the power and gets what it wants. “No supplies before lack of grievances” or “No taxation without representation” were popular slogans during the English revolution. They refuse to give money unless they get what they want. King John signed the Magna Carta because he needed money to fight France. ● Religious: religion makes it a matter of principle, of morality. The Magna Carta gave freedom of the Church and of the clergy; it was written by Langton, a bishop. The only intellectuals that existed were in the Church.

Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 5 M. Stephen Baskerville Inspired by the American bill of rights, a similar point, a little more modern, does indicate that their rights are for everybody and can be applied to everybody. Right to social warfare, the government had to supply certain things. l During the modern period, bill of rights was associated with revolution, especially in France and America. Similarities between the revolutions: regicides in England and France. They set the groundwork for some events in the 20th century. Not much literature on the execution of Charles Ist, his execution was quicker but some on Louis XVI. Charles I was the first time in human history that a reigning monarch was put on trial and executed publicly by his people. Shocking event. It was done in the name of justice and religion. The central question in it was similar to that of Louis: was this the beginning of HR? Forcing governments to be answerable to their people. Or was this the beginning of the reign of terror? The English have never really dealt with this because there was no real reign of terror in England but it’s an interesting question. The idea of putting government officials on trial for human rights offences has become very popular at the end of the 20th century. Religion was extremely important in Britain. The Puritan ministers drove the revolution in England. The French revolution was quite different, it was a real revolution, it wasn’t religious at first. But there are a lot of striking similarities between both revolutions. The French imitated the English (In the Russian Revolution, Trotski wanted to do the same and put Nicholas II on trial, but he was shot before he could be put on trial). The role of religion in the American revolution is striking even though not as important as in England. The American revolution is midway between English and French revolution. But they never executed their leader, they severed their relation with him. Some call their revolution a “British civil war”. Also similarities in the constitutional aspects. On the popular level, the American revolution was driven by religion, the preachers encouraged the revolution in religious terms on the popular level. Many said that king George was the anti-Christ. Each of this revolutions was influenced by the previous one American constitution: - habeas corpus. Comes up all the time in court. The British created the policy of what they call: “internment”, the British would take an array of people and keep them in jail for a long time without charging them with any crime. People couldn’t do much about it because the British didn’t have a written constitution that they could bring up in court as being violated. - prohibits ex post facto laws: makes something illegal after it is done, being prosecuted for something that you did before the law was passed, when it was legal. Increasingly violated in American courts. - prohibits acts of Attainder (=condamnation sans preuve), or bill of attainder: legislative declaration of guilt. The law declaring a person to be guilty of crimes. Laws that are passed aimed at particular people. During the English revolution, a law declared someone to be guilty of treason and he was executed for it. Acts or bills of attainder are prohibited but in recent years they have still been passed in court. One time the people it was aimed at suffered punishments during 6 years before the supreme court reacted and declared it an act of attainder.

Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 6 M. Stephen Baskerville - does not contain a presumption of innocence. The 2nd Amendment, the right to bear arms, is based upon the principle of a militia, a civilian army. Goes back to the concept of the militia as an alternative to the standing army, which can be considered dangerous and the source of coups d’Etat and threaten freedom. 5th amendment: concept of the grand jury. In some States they have been abolished. Prosecutors can become too powerful or aggressive, prosecuting innocent people for crimes they didn’t commit, or for trivial things. They have an incentive to convict people of crime, for money. The grand jury is a safeguard against that. Composed of 20 people, they were expected to decide if there was enough evidence to put people on trial, as a protection against abusive career prosecutors. Can also protect against plea bargain (négociation de peine) manipulation. But now grand juries are a thing of the past. It has come up in the international criminal court, putting people on trial for international crimes. What safeguards do these people have against political or abusive prosecutions? Their protections exist but aren’t adequate. II Modern Modern campaigns to secure rights, concept of self-determination. A Slavery and Abolitionism 19th century: anti-slavery movement was extremely important for later HR. Did have a universal appeal. Striking elements of the anti-slavery movement: ● Absence of natural rights theories. John Locke, (17th) supposedly father of natural rights theories, didn't talk about slavery at all. Wrote a constitution (1670) allowing slavery for Carolina. ● By contrast, in England, Evangelical protestants were the leaders against slavery as being anti-christian, they participated in the education of the youth. ● One theory said that anti-racism emerged from natural rights theories. Slavery had gone back to the Ancients, it was an institution, nobody questioned its existence. It didn’t have racial connotations, nobody condemned it. There was no need to justify slavery in racial terms. But when natural rights theories came along, when they started talking about everyone being equal, they started questioning the existence of slaves. The Americans were hypocritical because they kept talking about freedom but had the most slaves. So they started to justify slavery by racial arguments, by that, slaves weren’t human anymore and they didn’t have to be concerned by natural rights theories. Irony of modern liberalism. B Working class movement Working class movement in English 19th century liberalism. ● They also had their roots in evangelical protestantism. It was not marxist, English and American working class movement was never marxist, protestantism and methodism Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions.

Stephen Baskerville was much more important. Thomas Paine first concept of a welfare state (=Etat providence): maternity concepts… ● Chartist movement (Chartism), developed around the People’s Charter (1838). Everything they demanded failed but was eventually implemented, but much later. Came after the Great Reform Act of 1832 which disappointed a lot of people. The Chartists demanded ○ Equal electoral districts (rotten boroughs [=bourg pourri]: places which attracted a lot of people during the industrial revolution but their number of parliament representatives stayed the same as the places with no population, pocket boroughs). ○ Annual parliament, so the king or the prime minister could just dissolve parliament for several years. ○ Payment of MP (members of parliament) ○ Property qualifications to allow people to vote (poor people weren’t allowed to vote) C Women’s rights First important event was the 1848 Seneca Falls Declaration which demanded equal rights for women to vote. They also pushed for legalised divorce. The UN had 6 conventions on women, overwhelmingly women's rights are more present than other rights. Fundamentally different from all other rights advocation and was the most controversial whereas now it’s sexual, homosexual and transgender rights. The idea of human rights based on sexuality is probably the most cutting edge, extreme and innovative one today, and the one that occupies the most attention. Women’s rights have grown enormously since 1848. In all the early modern revolutions (English, French, American, Russia), there was always an aspect of women’s rights. Never the main part, but always a marginal feature. Divorce, for example, was also enacted in the French and Russian revolutions. Some of the more extreme religious groups would practice things like equality of the sexes and extra-marital sex. 1979 islamic revolution: a huge role was played by women carrying kalashnikovs. The women were not forced to participate but were enthusiastic participants. In each revolution, women’s rights become a more important question, even in Iran, which is a paradox. Women find it empowering but the revolution limited their rights. Like puritanism, puritanism morality (ascétisme), was a major part of the American revolution. Religious morality even played a role in France (Robespierre: incorruptibles) and Lenine founded sexual liberation as bourgeois and wanted to be more puritan “The revolution demands concentration”. Ideology of the French revolution is republicanism, basically secularised puritanism. D Civil Rights 1950s 60s and 70s, civil rights agitation. Most famous in America but also in Brazil and African americans. They didn’t use the language of HR, but civil rights, anti-colonialism, anti-racism(Martin Luther King). It drew on various forms of direct action by citizens rather than litigation by lawyers. Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute. Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 8 M. Stephen Baskerville Lots of racial militants. MLK’s action was as much a matter of nurturing the mainstream movements. Talks about self-purification. Emphasis on the role of religion in the civil rights movements. Most of the activists were preachers. The marxists were ostracized. MLK challenges the whole process of progress which must come from the oppressed and not the oppressor. Colored people receiving rights eventually isn’t a reason to delay it. Rational notion that something in the flow of time will eventually cure all illness. Extremely critical of christian churches. Talks about the judgment of God upon the church. Gandhi talks about satyagraha, peaceful non-violence, as a form of action. He was trained in English laws Unjust human laws not written in eternal law; Invokes Hungarian freedom fighters from 1966. III International Bills of rights 1948: the beginning of the HR agenda The league of nations makes no mention of HR. It’s not till after WWII that the HR agenda really takes off. Universal Declaration of HR. Most of its points were then incorporated in the first two binding documents: ● International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) ● International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Binding treaties which came into effect in 1976 in UK but voted in 1966 in the ONU assembly. People talk about first, second (and even third generation rights). Negative/positive rights, freedom from/ freedom to ● First generation rights: ➔ Most of the rights before 1948: Magna Carta, English and American bill of rights, constitutional theories, natural theories ➔ Often referred to as negative rights, rights which are claimed against the state and are mostly about being left alone, or what the state has to refrain from doing. Freedom of speech, of religion, of opinion, of press, basic freedom of expression. It doesn’t cost anything. Procedural rights/justice, trials. Homeschooling and private schooling. Right of association. ➔ They are precise and fairly easy to identify. ◆ They can be adjudicated in a court. ◆ They can be enforced immediately ◆ They tend to be non ideological, non controversial. ◆ They are easy to measure ➔ They tend to be protection against the state but not always: other people can interfere with freedom of speech or press (cf Charlie Hebdo). ● Second generation rights, Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions.

Stephen Baskerville ➔ Positive rights, the state has to provide something, people sometimes revolt against some of this cause it arguably reduces freedom, should the state be endorsing education? ➔ much more controversial, not something you can claim immediately, it’s more of an ideal . ➔ They are arguably not ideologically neutral. ➔ They are not easy to measure ◆ The right to education (cf Thomas jefferson, thomas Paine). When education is a right, it is most often also compulsory. ◆ The right of social welfare ◆ The right to paid vacation ◆ The right to minimum wage ● Third generation are kind of the same thing but more political. Universal declaration of HR inspired greatly by the French declaration of human rights. Freedom from poverty, concept of social progress. - Article 3 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and the security of a person. - Article 4 No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms. - Article 5 No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. - Article 6 Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. - Article 7 All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.

Stephen Baskerville 2006 treaty on forced disappearances. Traditionally, treaties were concerned with two things. ● Strategic relationships ● Trade, economic relationships. The use of them for human rights is a new thing. Pertained to the internal population of countries, so resembles domestic law. Human rights treaties involve themselves on domestic policy. Sometimes even involved in the spending capacities of countries. But a treaty generally when broken allows retaliation but when a country violates human rights treaties you can’t retaliate. It’s difficult to enforce. Countries who signed the treaties are answerable to the international community. In order to enforce the human rights treaties, they created monitoring committees of “experts” on human rights. They do examinations, issue reports, and apply pressure on those who don’t respect HR. But it’s not very effective. Gives quite a lot of power or at least public profile to the monitoring committees. CRC CDAW? ICCPR (political and civil rights) Not very controversial, mostly negative rights ● Freedom from fear ● Art 1: all peoples have the right of self determination (controversial because used by fascists and nazis) ● Art 2 prohibits discrimination of any kind such as race, color… or other status such as sexual orientation or gender identity (SOGI) ● Condemns the practice of genocide, already subject of another treaty in 1938 ● Torture is prohibited (controversial) ● Arbitrary detention is prohibited, habeas corpus, trial within a reasonable period of time ● Noone can be imprisoned for debt or other inability to complete a deal. ● Liberty of movement, right to leave and enter the country ● Art 14 provides for open public justice, but also talks about how justice can be held behind closed doors in certain circumstances (not easily defended). ● Presumption of innocence ● Right to attorney ● Right to be examined and to examine the witnesses against you (the Istanbul convention violates that specifically if it passes). ● Not to be tried twice for the same offense (double jeopardy) ● Cannot be tried for a crime which was not an offense at the time (ex pro facto laws) ● Right of privacy ● Freedom of thought ● Freedom of religion, freedom to change religion and to manifest religion ● Freedom of education to your children in non-government schools and at home ● Art 19 Freedom of expression, but the exercise of your opinion can be restricted. ● Art 20 prohibits any propaganda for war Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions.

Stephen Baskerville ● Advocacy of national, racial or other hatred is prohibited (controversial) used as the basis for hate speech and hate crime laws. In contradiction to the freedom of expression ● Right to peaceful assembly ● Freedom of association ● Art 23 rights of family (cf later) ● Minorities have the right to their own culture, religion and language. ● Discrimination of any kind is prohibited (controversial) ● Equal rights to men and women ● Right to work, fair wages, equal remuneration, safe workplace, reasonable working hours, vacations with pay (controversial: who pays?) ● Trade unions ● Right to strike, although prohibitions on that for members of the armed forces and the government. ● Social security and social insurance (controversial: who pays?) ● Right to an adequate standard of living, adequate food… ● Right to be free from hunger (controversial: who provides?) ● Environmental and industrial hygiene. ● Right of everyone to education (controversial): primary education: free and for everyone, secondary and university is not clear. At the time this was written, few people went to higher education. Doesn't talk about the content of this education but implies that it can be used for political indoctrination “shall strengthen the respect of HR and freedom”, “to promote friendship between all nations…” . Later HR treaties require governments to use education to inculcate political ideology and beliefs. The International Bill of Rights started in 1948, covenants started in 1966. The UN weren’t the only ones to draft HR documents after WWII. Europe and Latin America did the same thing. But odd because it didn’t have much effect. HR didn’t become an issue in politics immediately. In the 1950s, a lot was going on, with a lot of political movements but not HR. It didn’t start taking off until the late 1970s. It was mostly political agitation before that. It started in the 1970s because a lot of things were going on: ● The Cold war began to thaw in the 1970s. President Nixon pushed for easy interactions with the Soviets, and tried to reduce the tension. SALT treaties were negotiated. ● Ostpolitik in Germany, with a left wing chancellor. ● Helsinki accords in 1975, conference that went on for a couple years with all the countries in Europe, Soviets and Americans. Some people saw it as a way to dilute the power of the Americans and the Soviets, and it was an effort to reduce tensions: “rapprochement”. The Soviets wanted recognition of their borders and of the government. The west wanted recognition of HR. They essentially traded: the west recognized the legitimacy of the eastern bloc, and the east recognized a certain number of HR. After Helsinki, eastern countries started to create HR organizations. They used the accords to justify it to their governments when they had problems. Charter 77, Solidarity… Helsinki created an organization called Conference for security and cooperation in Europe (CSCE became OSCE), and the ICCPR, which came into effect in 1976 Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute. Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 12 M. Stephen Baskerville ● The Jackson Vanik amendment, required the US State department to use trade power as leverage to force the Soviets to allow jews to leave for America. In the Cold War, the HR were used on both sides. As a result, creation of other NGOs (Helsinki watch and later on HR watch, Amnesty international which is frequently accused of being very left wing and using HR to impose an agenda, OSCE (organization of security convention in Europe) It was something that both the left and the right found useful but there were significant impediments to the HR. - The conservatives wanted to emphasize the HR violation of the Soviets - The left wanted to emphasize the abuses in the west. Both sides accused the other of hypocrisy. Lot of obstructions to HR because many people didn’t accept the idea of imposing certain codes of conducts to other countries. The notion of sovereignty was very strong. There were charges of moral hypocrisy and cultural superiority. Some people argued that violating HR was part of cultural traditions. Others argued that we don’t have the right to impose our moral codes on other countries but we also don’t have the right to pay for their violation of HR. Carter was very criticized and blamed for the revolution in Iran, and the HR agenda he promised and didn’t put in place was contradictory to what he did in Iran. There were some groups of HR organizations in the Soviet Bloc: ● Charter 77, organized in Slovakia by Patocka and Havel , included many communists and influenced Gorbatchev. ● Solidarity in Poland HR also became much more important in the 80s with the collapse of the communist regime in 1989. The color revolution, Ukraine… all helped and became part of the discourse. During the 1980s there was a lot of democratization in the world like in Latin America, East Asia, Africa, but not very much in the middle east. Democratization theory became fashionable. Transitional justice. Many countries felt that they couldn’t just forgive and forget the atrocities that were committed in the dictatorial regimes. In Europe with Franco guilty of HR atrocities, the apartheid movement in South Africa… To resolve that, they had to do something, punish the perpetrators. But usually there are too many people to punish. That’s what transitional justice is about (Nuremberg and Tokyo). It came back in the late 1980s to present day. Criminal trials for Yugoslavia and Uganda for example. - Trials - Truth and reconciliation commissions (Africa, Chile): people were promised if they came forward to confess their crimes, they would be forgiven (it was very controversial) - Lustration (Czechoslovakia): fairly popular in eastern Europe, latin for purification. It was the idea that those who perpetrated crimes under the communist government would not be punished but would be prevented from serving in government and universities (also controversial). Some people who weren’t guilty were punished. Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute. Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 13 M. Stephen Baskerville The first trials of political leaders go back to Charles Ist in England and Louis XVI in France (older than the idea of HR). At the time it was fairly shocking. It was the first time a reigning monarch was tried and executed by his own subjects. It happened again late XXth century after the Cold War, with the creation of the ICTY (international criminal tribunal for Yugoslavia) and ICTR (idem for Rwanda). These trials were very controversial. Sometimes warlords or private individuals were put on trial when they were thought to have committed atrocities. These tribunals were created by the UN. Another one was created for Sierra Leone. They were then institutionalized in the ICC (international criminal court) which also has a relationship with the UN. Some countries also created tribunals to put their leaders on trial in national courts. These raised questions on the nature of HR: ● Issue of international criminal jurisdiction. Generally speaking, justice is done on a national level. What does international criminal jurisdiction do? In what sense is it a crime? What kind of law is there internationally? How do you punish an international crime? These trials are attempts to create stronger enforcement mechanisms. How practical is it? ● With the ICTR they found that it was extremely time consuming and expensive ● Question of the justice of the trials. Can you apply laws designed for ordinary crimes to government officials who are carrying out certain policies? 1649, trial of Charles I: by what code of law can you put the king on trial? Charles refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the trial. He refused to plead. Louis XVI refused to recognize the legitimacy of the trial. Charles was tried by a special court created by the parliament, and many refused to participate because they thought the elected officials couldn’t try the king, also because these were special courts, not ordinary courts of the land. Laughland believed that the verdicts were a forgone conclusion, all of them were declared guilty. Once you rise in rebellion against the king, you have to kill him or he’ll punish you. These are also regime trials, you’re not just trying the king but the entire monarchy itself. A presumption of innocence of the king is a presumption of guilt against the new government. Charles and Louis were put on trial to delegitimize the previous government so as to legitimize the new one. But today, the kind of regime being installed is an international one. That raises a couple of questions. Does the revolutionary paradigm live on to the present day? Have the English and the French revolutionaries basically transported their revolutions to today? ➔ First major trial: Nuremberg. One of the great misconceptions was that it was a trial for the Holocaust. But it wasn’t because these atrocities were barely coming to light at that time. The Allies had turned a blind eye to the Holocaust during the war. The Nuremberg trial was putting the Nazis on trial for their crimes against peace, for making war. The Axis powers put on this trial. So basically the Nazis. The trial did not include the Allies, who also committed certain excesses that could be described as crimes against non combatants. The Nuremberg trials didn’t have any jurisdiction with NATO. They couldn’t put the Allies on trial because it would put them on the same moral plane as the Nazis. But if you don’t put them on trial that means you already assume that the ones you’re putting on trial are guilty: double standard.

Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 14 M. Stephen Baskerville atrocities committed by the Soviets weren’t judged. Even crimes committed by the Nazis were ignored when they were deemed the same as the crimes of the Allied forces: the Germans weren’t prosecuted for the Blitz against Britain. It was a very selective justice. This new crime against peace created a precedent but was never used again because it was so obviously selective justice. This was happening at the same time as the UN was created. The principles of justice were not just. The Soviets were being incorporated into the UN and they were heavily involved in the Nuremberg trials. The UN system and the Nuremberg trials were from the beginning tainted by Soviet justice when the Soviets were killing so many people at the same time. Thus the justice was very questionable. Individuals were being incorporated into international law. Criminal conspiracy and criminal association were questionable concepts that they used: leaders could be guilty of crimes their subordinates committed during their government, even when they didn’t order them, or knew about them. Questionable legal theory, criminal conspiracy, crime people haven’t committed… Some of the reasons for Nuremberg were used later on but with more questionable reasons. The other criticism was by the Soviets: the soviet ideology was by nature transnational, but the American wanted a new system of international law and won this war of influence. Finally people criticized the fact that the trial was stopped: the fight wasn’t over for some people. But it is not possible to trial everybody: where is the line drawn? Concept of crime against peace has been since then ignored, trials only for atrocity in the course of a war. Nuremberg did not have an influence on trial later on. ➔ Same issues in the Tokyo trial. Winner justice, criminalisation of war (difficult to prove, no precise definition, foreign policy needs the possibility of war otherwise it’s not taken seriously (cf the nuclear weapon lesson of DIH). To outlaw war is to deprive nations of an important tool, denying their sovereignty. The atomic bomb wasn’t included in this logic. It was a presumption of guilt towards the Japanese. No acquitals. Extremely selective justice: the emperor of Japan was exempted. Some people argued that the Japanese trial was one against the imperial power and not against war. It was one group of imperialists against their rival. The Japanese just wanted an empire like the Europeans had. But a presumption of guilt was implied. Those trials said they were bound by the rule of evidence. Critiques of HR agenda. (cf essai) ● Question of treaties. What are the implications of legislating HR globally? Treaties are the most solid and important form of international law. International law makes a distinction between: ○ Hard law, treaty, the country has agreed to it, it is difficult to sign it,... ○ Soft law, action of the UN, nobody agreed to them, it was only voted by an assembly. Treaties are the foundation of the international organization as UN and EU. It is possible to leave those organizations (unlike the USA).

Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 15 M. Stephen Baskerville They are difficult to enforce.Their status are hardly definable. Especially their status in domestic law. Many countries just sign them and ignore them. The monitoring committees just nag those that don’t abide by the treaty. The treaty on racism for example is useless in a lot of countries. The government chooses if the treaty is applied in court. Is the treaty legally enforceable in the country? The US constitution says that the treaties are equal to the constitution. But that raises other problems. What if the treaty is inconsistent with their own constitution? They’re often ignored. - Self-executing treaties - Non self-executing treaties, that aren’t enforceable in domestic law. Those prohibiting hate crimes and hate speech are not enforceable. This stems from the fact that treaties include domestic actions. In many countries family law is a matter of federal government. If the national government signs the treaty of children rights, can they enforce it if they don’t have the authority in family law? HR treaties seem to apply pressure to erode the sovereignty of nations. Some people suggest that countries should enforce HR as domestic policy rather than as foreign policy. But is it possible? The whole point of HR treaties is to modify domestic policy and legal practice. So in some ways it is offshore legislation. The concept of trying to import international law as domestic law by legislatures. ● Executive agreements are agreements between two powers/heads of government, they are not treaties but are nonetheless powerful because the government supports them. Those agreements are not clear on their domestic actions. Ex: 1990’s USA said to Russia that NATO would not expand. It was not a treaty, just a non-written agreement. But it wasn’t enforced. HR principles can become more binding than they should. ● Customary international law (règles coutumières): treaties, custom and tradition, writings of jurists, experts and lawyers, actions of international organizations. Very old concept. Means that things that have been observed like rules that countries have followed for as long as anyone can remember. For example, diplomatic immunity was never written down. Piracy on the high seas is punishable by anyone. This concept has been stretched to be used as a political weapon, to normalize certain practices that are claimed as customary international law. Sometimes domestic courts of some countries seem willing to accept this. Humanitarian war provisions have become part of it. Capital punishment has been used, as well as abortion. People are claiming that abortion is a HR. If you say enough times that it’s a HR, you can claim that it will be recognized as one even though it is not. Domestic law is precise but international law is nebulous and unclear. A principle of the law is that it should be precise. Who codifies the fact that abortion should be international law? The legislature must be precise. When an innovative practice is made, an election or vote should ratify it. For abortion, there wasn’t one, it’s completely unaccountable but suddenly it’s law all over the world. ● Collective rights, standard conservative opposition to HR agenda. The African Union has “human rights and peoples rights”. Increasingly popular in HR concepts are the rights of particular groups of people, like sexual rights, women rights, children rights, Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions.

Stephen Baskerville SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity, wasn’t recognised in any treaty). HR pertain to everybody, but women’s rights only pertain to women, so “women’s human rights” would be an oxymoron. The concept of family rights comes up and accords specific rights to the family. Most conservatives believe it’s a good thing but they’re the same people who object to the rights of specific groups, or collective rights. The protections for the family in those documents are extremely weak. The UN documents are extremely weak on parental rights. But if parental rights were more protected, it would also better protect family rights. Same thing for the right to have family privacy. The docs protect the family as a group but it might not be the most effective way to do so. It might be better to protect more individual rights. Soft law (docs that come out of UN meetings and conferences) becoming hard law is what they hope for. They want to transform it to hard law in the form of treaties. SOGI is still just soft law. “Agreed language” is used to design concepts such as SOGI. “Reproductive rights/health” includes the right of abortion. They’re constantly trying to get the reproductive rights into agreed language until it can get into a treaty. The term “gender” is only in the statute of the international criminal court, but it is defined as “two biological sexes, male and female”. The Istanbul convention also includes the word “gender” but defines it as something you can choose. The “right to international solidarity” usually means some form of economic redistribution, taking from the rich and giving to the poor. The “right to economic development”, who does it concern, how do you provide it, how do you go about it? What it implies is not clear and what people think about it is often very contradictory. Right to a clean environment, to safe housing… Are third generation rights. Rights of peasants. Right to global health is pushed by the world health organization because it would give them more power. Rights of animals and even inanimate objects. The concept of rights has often been closely intertwined with imperialism. England in the 16th and 17th century was starting to talk about rights just as they were building their empire. Same for the US, they went on to expand right after writing down their constitution and bill of rights. Napoleon used the concept of rights as a way to precede the expansion of his empire. In our own time, people have argued that the most recent manifestation of this dynamic are the Americans in the Bush administration who have used the concept of HR as a rationalization of warfare (Irak, Libya…). Not only Americans but also NATO. HR should not be left to international organizations. It should be the role of national governments. Free speech. (cf essay on this subject by Coleman?) English bill of rights only allowed it in the parliament, Americans made it larger. The exercise of that right can be restricted. Art 20 of the bill of rights requires restrictions on speech, for example the restriction on war propaganda. But who’s to say what war propaganda is? Restricts it if it encourages or incites discrimination. Punishable by law all incitement to racial discrimination. So protection for freedom of speech and expression are not that strong and even prohibited in some cases. Laws are being passed against hate Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute. Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 17 M. Stephen Baskerville speech and hate crimes. But how do you define hate or incitement to discrimination? If hate is punished, can extreme dislike be legal? Laws against defamation of religion or blasphemy are infringement on freedom of religion and freedom of expression. If you don’t allow criticism of religion, you’re inhibiting freedom of speech. You’re protecting the right to protect people for their religious preference. The UN has generally resisted blasphemy laws but has accepted hate speech laws, but some people argue that blasphemy is included in hate speech, which is defined vaguely by the phrase “discriminatory language”. Likewise the EU, describes hate speech as “disrespectful public discourse”. The UN HR committee presses very strongly for hate speech prohibition. Religious freedom (cf essay) Big issue in recent years, a vast majority of the world’s population lives in countries with prohibitions on religious freedom. In the global south, the vast majority of religious freedom violations take place because of governments. Nigeria: the government is fairly neutral but groups of muslim attack groups of christians. It is the country in the world with the most violence linked to religion. In India, people are persecuted by other groups even when there is religious freedom de facto. Some states in India condone the act of hindu mobs attacking muslims and christians, often done with the help or authorization of the state government. Violation of religious freedom also comes from controversies over sexuality, sexual freedom. People often oppose religious freedom to sexual freedom. Education, clothing… can go against religious freedom. A US government official says explicitly that sexual freedom should come before religious freedom. There is increasingly more literature across the world against religious freedom. Before, even atheists were in favor of religious freedom. The Pew foundation did research on religious freedom. In recent years, left wing people have started to question religious freedom, whereas not long ago, it would have been unthinkable. Many people allege that the UN has not done enough to protect religious freedom. The FRA (fundamental rights agency of the EU) is often accused of protecting sexual rights more than they are protecting religious freedom. The ICC (international criminal court) has also been accused of not protecting religious freedom. However, the OSCE has a good reputation in regards to religious freedom. Nations have undertaken initiatives to enforce HR as part of their policy rather than relying on international organizations. The US created the IRFA (international religious freedom act): religious freedom became a part of US foreign policy. They created a state office in charge of religious freedom, an ambassador for religious freedom, and the USCIRF (US commission of international religious freedom). They did all that because they wanted it to be effective and only one of these creations wouldn’t have done its job. Especially since religious freedom is not very high on the state department's list of priorities. They distinguish what they call countries of particular concern (CPC) which are countries where religious freedom isn’t respected. Other countries followed this act. More and more people on the conservative side are saying that freedom is more than freedom of speech, but also a freedom of worship and association. If a catholic organization hires only catholics is it discrimination? Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute.

Stephen Baskerville Diplomats are trained to make politics the most important thing, not moral issues. International criminal jurisdiction: Traditionally human rights deals with what governments do, not individuals. In fact there is a distinction between what is covered by criminal law and what is covered by human rights. One cannot judge the other. Crimes are generally a matter of criminal law enforcement. But sometimes human laws cover an accusation towards a human. Par exemple en Yougoslavie ou au Rwanda. Généralement ce sont des décideurs politiques. Au Rwanda en revanche c’est bien particulier, peut être cela aurait dû être jugé comme des meurtres et non une violation du droit humain. De plus en plus, les organisations internationales essayent d’utiliser criminal jurisdiction in human laws. But criminal jurisdiction can also be used against private actors and individuals. We need to think about how we protect people. SOme tribunals created are nationals, sometimes created by the country themself, but they are special as the Romanian tribunal in 1999. The court against Saddam Hussein in Iraq (but this one was in reality controlled by the Americans). ICTY and ICTR No one said that murder or theft is human rights violation. But sometimes it is taken as human rights even though they could be treated by criminal tribunals. This distinction isn’t always clear. Those trials often resolve when there is a change, voluntary or not, of regime. It sometimes involves the creation of a new regime. Peru, Ukraine and Egypt. Some of these trials: ● Trial of Nikola Ceaușescu, in Romania (cf doc). Almost all the governments of the former soviet bloc collapsed simultaneously except Romania. They put their leader on trial and executed them. The velvet revolution of 1989 was for the most part peaceful except Romania. It was not a popular revolution but rather a coup staged by Russia. The western media played along with it for the most part. Around 200 people died. They made it appear that Ceaușescu had used his army to attack his own people. We know today for a fact that this accusation isn’t true. In reality it was orchestrated by Moscow. The crowd that “attacked” him wasn’t angry at him but was agitated for other reasons. He was shot on christmas day. The communist party then took over. The trial legitimized the change of regime. Maybe Gorbatchev voulait remplacer un communist trop dur par un plus soft. It’s not clear ● Milošević trial. Organized by the UN. But he died so he was never convicted. Many Serbian felt the trial was unjust to this day. The Serbs were demonized in the western world. Croats were portrayed as victims of serbians aggression. 1999, took place Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute. Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 19 M. Stephen Baskerville with the bombing of NATO. Some saw a calculation between the two organizations. Nato bombed because they were supposed to maintain peace and order. Nato was there because of the ethnic cleansing against the Kosovars ,they claimed that Serbians were aggressive. Show that NATO was more effective than the UN because they do not follow the same rules of engagement. The bombing in Serbia was the first big manifestation. But it didn’t feel justified. Tony Blair said it was part of a new world order, Bill Clinton said something similar. Human rights became a justification for military intervention. R2P: responsibility to protect. Serbia was not a direct threat to the world peace order but we bombed them anyway. Major violation of a lot of things. The charges against Milošević were crimes against war,... ● The US invaded Iraq, because they supposedly had weapons of mass destruction. In fact they did not. Human rights permitted this rationalization of military intervention. War then trials which changed government. But it wasn’t authorized by the security council, it was against the UN. The US violated the occupation laws. They purged the people. The court had retroactive justice. Many of the actual charges were extremely selective: the war of Iraq against Iran wasn’t part of it. The selection is because at this time the Americans supported iraq. Americans were involved. It isn’t justice but a political and cynical decision against a government. ● Some people shouldn’t be taken alive as Bin Laden who was killed and couldn’t have a trial. A trial would have been too dangerous and a public relations disaster for the US. ● Some people have legal immunity. Sometimes it’s unfair, sometimes it’s practical. Government officials of any kind aren’t responsible for domestic laws. Police officer who killed George Floyd, was arrested and put on trial for murder. Some people think officers should be protected and should be arrested for their crime if they do a bad job, they should only be dismissed. His job is to use deadly sources, but is he a murderer for doing a bad job? In the 1970’s people were brought towards the human rights agenda because they were more concerned about the fact that the government was acting against it. Economic social rights was a bit talked about but government oppression was a major subject in the media. “Enforcing international laws that will prevent governments from doing horrible things to their people”. “Human rights law is not interested in torture [...] only if it is by a government or a state”. The public was kinda sucked into the subject. Initially people didn’t think about it. Several trials. In the US bills of rights, a jury trial doit prendre place au lieu où le crime à eu lieux avec des gens locaux pour juger. On ne peut pas déplacer une affaire sinon c’est injuste. Conviction is treated as an end in itself in human rights laws. If you don’t convict it is bad even though the person you are trying to sue is innocent. Les dirigeants et les responsables sont censés savoir ce que fait leur subordonné. Alors ils peuvent être condamné pour leur actions. They talk about an empty immunity. This court are not accountable to anyone. Initially Taylor refused to come to court.

Les Etats-Unis refusent parfois l’action de la cour internationale, et l'acceptent à d’autre moment pour des raisons purement politiques. If he hadn't been convicted it would have been a failure for the court. He was engaged in a plan to destroy Sierra Leone, but we could argue that he was fighting in a war. He didn’t directly commit the crime itself but should have known, it is some kind of double standart from the court, because it didn’t specifiy any specific crime Explosion of those cases after WWI and especially after WWII. Kadafi case Trend towards national trials. Once rulers are in power they can accuse their opponent of human rights crimes. Today some people want to put Trump and his supporters on trial. The idea of putting people on trial is more and more popular. Ivory Coast election, the USA took part in the election. Also involve the security council, because the international court gives its power. Threat to national peace and security is a reason but in the Ivory coast it wasn’t the case, just a disputed election. The herb spray revolution was also justified for him. The international criminal court The international criminal court, at the human rights agenda beginning in the 1840 and 50 people wanted a criminal court but couldn’t because of the war. When it was created, Russia, INdia, USA, Israel and China refused to join. Israel is a particular case because they pushed a lot for it, to condemn the nazis but backed off. It is only permitted to trial important crimes as ,,, and aggression crime which is not defined. It does include sexual crimes. It can only take a case if the domestic court has failed to take the case. In fact, it is judging its own case, a case of double jeopardy because you can be trialed again after being charged by a domestic court. It cannot apprehend suspects, nor punish criminals. It requires that state uniformize the law to be alined with international law. The ICC can take a case by: being referred by a member state, member of the UN or the prosecutor office by its own initiative with the “accord” of two judges. There is no grand jury, designed to protect civilians against unfair prosecutors. Chapter 7 of the UN charter. The ICC cannot refuse a case that the security council presents. The power of the security council. Controversial “choices” All the cases, except one, take place in Africa. Some argue there is a vendetta against Africa, some others say that if it took place in the country of the criminal, the government will step in to protect them. Some others say it is racist. ICC can also make some advisory answers. Rome statute defines sexual crime as within the jurisdiction of the ICC. Child's soldiers is another controversial area. As religious liberty, no trials against Iraq for their crimes against religious freedom. But nobody chooses to put them on trial, it is not a priority. As in Myanmar and Nigeria, which commited religious violence. The ICC does not take care of terrorists. Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions.

Stephen Baskerville To bring persecutor to justice doesn’t seem to solve any problem (le mec si quelqu’un qui crève de faim lui demande à manger il va rien lui donner parce que ca “reglera pas le soucis de la faim dans le monde”). It could push people to be more ruthless and desperate to stay in power because if a dictator loses it the conséquence are bigger because of the trial that they could be put on (cf cours Granpipi S3). Pinochet, dictator of Chile, went to London for medical reasons after he lost power and was put on trial by Spain for the crime in Chile. The reason behind it is that because his crimes are so big, anyone should be able to put him on trial but is it really fair? Who should be covered by the ICC? Who should be trialed? Is NATO included? Bon en gros le prof a un problème sur le fait qu’on fait des procès qu’aux “bad guys” mais comme on l’a vu en S3 en DIH c’est le cas et c’est comme ca que ca fonctionne, l’ICC n’est pas là pour déterminer si quelqu’un est coupable ou pas étant donné que pour présenter un cas il faut déjà avoir des preuves de sa culpabilité mais juste détermine sa peine et la hauteur de son implication. Visiblement le prof est pas convaincu If we include the Taliban we should include the Americans, we presume that people are guilty, which is not fair. If we put Russian on a trial we should also put Ukraine and why not the country that gave it some weapons. Kamala Harris, came out with a statement in which they had determined that Russia is guilty of war crimes. Since when is it their role? ICC announced that Putin has committed war crimes, their reasons are questionable because neither Russia nor Ukraine are part of the ICC. Transitional justice in south africa: if you renounce yourself you have amnesty. Peace treaty usually have some amnesty clauses. Family and sexualization of Human Rights Area of family and sexuality is in huge growth today. D. Cere. What she is saying, human rights are a discourse, a language, and a political tool. It is not about rights but about pushing a political agenda. Human rights are not static and fixed, they are determined by history and by needs. It is about expanding the definition of rights to include political needs. It is not any more some universal rights equal for everyone, by protecting certain groups, as women, it becomes a tool, a language. It is a huge shift, it is transforming to have larger goals. Feminist Human Rights are doing more than expanding, they are undermining the distinction between public and private (definition of freedom for our teacher), challenging the social contracts, and demanding a reconsideration of the definition of Human Rights. They are more intrusive than the other human rights agenda. One of them is CEDAW (1979), one of the earlier human rights conventions which have been very controversial: the people who support it want to make abortion a human right, which is not even mentioned in this convention. Intrusive into the private life and private belief of people. The first treaty in which a private individual alone can be put on trial without the action of a government. Some people argue that it is dangerous for religious freedom because they say that the beliefs that are against sexual freedom need to be eradicated. It has to change the beliefs of the children. “Government should take appropriate measures” to change the belief of people to tend to eradicate sexism. Is it the role of the government? It is kinda a call for propaganda. Condemn the discrimination by anyone, including private Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions.

Stephen Baskerville persons. It also seems to simultaneously legalize and punish prostitution: they want to prosecute human trafficking (sometimes prostitution) but want to legalize prostitution. These treaties are highly innovative because they include things that the treaty doesn’t usually include. There is no way to enforce them. They all have mandatory committees that do research and recommendation to the country to incite them to act in favor of the treaty. For example they accuse Norway of giving too much religious freedom, they are scolding it. The state is responsible for controlling religious beliefs that are going against their definition of human rights, gender equality,.... Scold Iceland for not having a gender equality party in their parliament. They also said that temporary measures that discriminate women and men to end sexism is not discrimination. As quotas. CRC, Convention of the Rights of the Child, 1989, deals with the relationship between parents and children, and goes further than the CEDAW. List series of insecurities against children around the world. But it isn’t clear how a Treaty could prevent child abuse. Only two people could violate the rights: parents and others. If another person is threatening the child’s rights the parents should protect them. So some people argue that the CRC is made against parents. It also centralizes power in government. It shifts the power from the parents to the state. In most countries family law and family policy is local. And it shifts the power from the local community to the national government, to the united nation. So far it is not reinforced. Most countries signed this treaty with no intention to apply it: everyone ratified it except the US. It doesn’t make any difference. Some countries give to the treaties the power to be applied in the domestic courts. (cf la France, Treaty>constitution ��). It could have a huge impact. Customary international Law, is a legitimate concept that refers to law that has been going on for so long that nobody questions it anymore (as diplomatic law: you can’t kill or kidnap a diplomat/ piracy: they can be punished by anybody). Some people want to use this logic for abortion. Some people argue that CRC can be included in the domestic court of america because it is customary international law without being ratified. Children have a right to privacy. But what does it mean in reality? Who could violate their privacy? Their parents. Who enforces that law? The state. Remove the family right of privacy because it accepts that the state enters in the family to see if the privacy is respected. In reality it removes the right to privacy. The best interest of the child, BIOTC, principle that originated in anglo-american divorce law. It means that a court has to implement a policy for the best interest of the child. The best interest of the child is determined by their parents and not by the state in American law. But now it is in the hands of the courts. The teacher is scared that the state is going to take away our children and give them to rich homosexual couples. CRC gives money to children's rights NGOs. Attached to the CRC is an optional protocol on the subject of child soldiers. Very important. The subject of child soldiers is a major subject, and a dimension of family law because it involves children. A few years ago there was a large communication in the media on child soldiers and atrocities made. David Rosan, for him the conventional view is almost entirely wrong: the protocol didn’t have any impact. His idea of the conventional view: children should not bear arms and adults who make them should be arrested. The atrocity is real but the narrative around is not. The children have long served in the military and sometimes Examination: shorts questions about various things, 30~40 questions. Pas qcm mais total point questions > note la plus haute. Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 23 M. Stephen Baskerville been given some honorable position. Child soldiers as a victim of war is a new concept. The reality about child soldiers is they are both perpetrators and victims. “Youth set people on fire”. Children are very sensitive to radical ideology that are more and more present in modern war. It creates a radicalized adolescence. They are recruited by other child soldiers on the glorification of the idea of war. Nkrumah was the leader of the pan-african ideology in ghana against the british, create an ideology called consciousness, Frantz Fanon wrote les damnés de la terre, the french version of the panafricanism is called negritude by Aimé Césaire, Senghor in Senegal. Those governments armed teenagers, the ideology was appealing to young people, they were not kidnapped, they joined because they trusted in a romanticized revolution. They were fighting against their parents. For those people it was some beautiful days of fighting for their freedom! Samora Machel in Mozambique, was the leader of the revolutionary movement against Portugal and became the first president, his wife, Graca, became the first education minister. They were using children for their revolution, they won and because western media liked them it didn’t cause any issue that they used child soldiers. Graca Machel became later the responsible of the anti child soldier agenda in the United Nation. Women who fought seem to consider this experience as empowering, but people want to portray them as victims. Not every girl was a sex slave, some fought for their beliefs. Children aren’t being abducted. The conventional solution is to bring all the people using children in war to prison, but most of them began by being themself a child soldier so they started as a victim. In fact they aren’t doing anything to change the world. Based on a false promise. Yogyakarta principles. SOGI, rights of homosexual and transgender, but no international law, binding treaty made about the rights of homosexual and trangender. Push for abortion to be a human right, advertised as a binding organization, which it is not. Require the state to silence criticism of those agenda: homosexuality, transgender,... But freedom of expression is a human rights (pourrait être contredit: en France on a pas le droit de se proclamer néo-nazi, je suis pas sur que ce soit une atteinte à la liberté d’expression). Religion must be contained if it criticizes homosexuality. The Istanbul Convention, the EU may ratify it as an institution which would make anyone who is a part of the EU part of the Convention. It is on the cutting edge of the Human Rights law. It is controversial, Turkey ratified it then backed off. It involves sexuality, something already adopted in the domestic law (but then it hasn’t been properly debated). The Rome statute. The statistics about domestic violence show that they are quite equal between women and men perpetrator. To protect against domestic violence why do we need a treaty? International law admits ordinary crime because it is the responsibility of domestic law. When someone is accused of human rights, we are raising more of a political issue, the standards aren’t the same as in a domestic court. But the Istanbul convention is the first attempt to take a whole part of domestic law into human rights. The justice system of free society needs to be removed in this logic. It is going against a way to protect civilians. This protection is removed by the Istanbul itself. It justifies the classification into a human right because it is, for them, a form of discrimination against women. Yet it is not the main justification: the discrimination also comes from the state that doesn't protect women equally from one state to another.

Ce ne sera pas des questions théoriques mais très spécifiques. Ex: how did the nuremberg and tokyo trial justify blablabla 24 M. Stephen Baskerville has been expanded. There is a presumption of guilt. Domestic violence is punished more frequently and taken care of quite differently than other domestic crimes. The British and American have the most proliferation of domestic violence laws and condamnation. Even aggression towards one's self esteem is considered domestic violence. The definition is expanding. “It seems that it is calculated, someone wants to remove those protections” - le prof. The all agenda of human rights is inseparable from IGO’s, UN, council of europe : they all have human rights codes. Human right phenomenon is not an accident. Human rights are internationally adjudicated. Without HR, international bodies have no. HR council (main institution), criticized for innovative human rights (smgi for example). 47 members meet in Geneva every spring. Easier to get resolution through this institution, so more controversial resolutions pass in it. It’s a regular rolling review. Mechanism is less open, quasi confidential. OHCHR: commissioner is a high profile figure. Michelle Bachalet, for example, is very strong on gender issues. Special procedure: → special rapporteur or mandate holders: possibility to investigate and promote HR in specific areas. Publish reports have a standing in international law, written by specially appointed people, that have authority. Contributors to these procedures are states (controversial because they can choose what subject they want to discuss) or private foundations (they can also influence the content of the report). In theory there is a justification, but in practice they have a political influence following an agenda. The open society foundation paid 300 000 dollars to influence the subject chosen by the special procedure to be domestic slavery. Principle of subsidiarity and proportionality Council of europe, is at the basis of codes of Human rights Private Sessions, but controversial because law should be public and transparent, injustice.

Stephen Baskerville Organization for security and cooperation in Europe: during the cold war 1970s. OSCI, done by NATO -> en gros il resume le livre de laughland Summary from chat gpt: John Laughland's \\"A History of Political Trials\\" is a comprehensive examination of the use of legal proceedings to silence political dissent throughout history. The book covers political trials from ancient Athens and Rome, through the Spanish Inquisition, the French Revolution, Stalin's show trials, and up to the present day. Laughland argues that political trials are not simply a tool for enforcing the law, but rather a way for powerful individuals and institutions to maintain their grip on power by silencing opposition. He shows how political trials have been used to persecute and even execute individuals who challenge the ruling class, from Socrates to the modern-day dissidents in countries such as China and Russia. The book also examines the changing nature of political trials over time. Laughland shows how the conceùpt of the \\"rule of law\\" has been manipulated by those in power to justify political prosecutions, and how the definition of \\"political crimes\\" has expanded to include not only violent acts, but also speech and even thoughts. Throughout the book, Laughland argues that political trials are a threat to individual freedom and democracy itself. He shows how the misuse of legal proceedings to silence dissent is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, and how the erosion of civil liberties is often a precursor to much greater abuses of power. Overall, \\"A History of Political Trials\\" is a thought-provoking and insightful exploration of the ways in which the legal system has been used to oppress and silence political dissidents throughout history. Laughland's analysis provides an important reminder of the importance of protecting the rule of law and individual rights in any free and democratic society.

This moment should feel like the culmination of the player's journey, providing a sense of closure, achievement, and emotional impact. Here are several strategies to ensure a game's climax or ending feels truly significant: 1. **Narrative Build-Up**: The story should build up to the climax in a way that increases tension and stakes. This involves developing a compelling narrative that intricately ties character motivations, plot points, and the game world's lore, progressively leading the player to the climax. Foreshadowing and plot twists can add depth and create anticipation for the ending. 2. **Character Arcs**: Well-developed character arcs that come to a satisfying closure by the game's end are essential. The player should see the growth or change in the characters they've become attached to, especially the protagonist. This emotional investment makes the climax feel more personal and rewarding. 3. **Challenging Gameplay**: The gameplay leading to and during the climax should present the player with challenges that test their skills and knowledge acquired throughout the game. It could involve a difficult boss fight, puzzles, or decisions that have significant consequences. Overcoming these challenges should feel rewarding and pivotal to the storyline. 4. **Integration of Gameplay and Story**: The climax should seamlessly integrate the game's mechanics with its narrative. The player's actions and choices should feel consequential to the story's outcome, making the climax feel like a direct result of their journey and decisions throughout the game. 5. **Visual and Auditory Impact**: Utilize the game's art direction and sound design to enhance the atmosphere and emotional weight of the climax. Dramatic visuals, powerful music, and impactful sound effects can significantly elevate the moment. 6. **Resolution and Reflection**: After the climax, provide the player with a resolution that ties up loose ends, answers key questions and allows time for reflection on the journey. This could involve epilogues, cut-scenes, or additional gameplay that ensure the story feels complete. 7. **Personalization**: Offering different endings based on the player's choices throughout the game can greatly enhance the feeling that this climax is unique to their journey, making it more impactful. These variations encourage players to reflect on how their decisions led to the final outcome. 8. **Emotional Resonance**: Aim to elicit an emotional response from the player. This can be achieved through the combination of story elements, character development, and gameplay achievements. Whether it's joy, sadness, or satisfaction, an emotional climax is more likely to be memorable and feel significant. 9. **Set Up for Future Exploration**: If the game is part of a series or the world has the potential for more stories, hint at future adventures or unresolved mysteries. This can make the ending feel like both a conclusion and a door to new beginnings, satisfying both the need for closure and the desire for more. Implementing these strategies can create a climax or ending that feels earned, satisfying, and true to the game's story and mechanics, leaving a lasting impact on the player."},{"instruction":"building on this, how can everything truly feel said and done?","output":"Creating a sense of finality in a game's climax or ending, where everything feels \\"said and done,\\" involves careful design and narrative planning. The goal is to leave the player with a feeling of closure, without lingering doubts or unresolved threads (unless intentionally setting up for a sequel). Here are strategies to ensure a conclusive and satisfying end: 1. **Resolve Key Conflicts**: Ensure that all major plotlines and character conflicts introduced throughout the game are resolved by the end. This doesn’t mean every minor question needs an answer, but major story arcs and conflicts should reach a resolution that feels true to the narrative. 2. **Fulfill Character Arcs**: Characters, especially the protagonist and main supporting characters, should reach the end of their development journeys. Show how they've grown, changed, or what they’ve learned. This might mean overcoming personal flaws, achieving their goals, or even failing in a way that resolves their story meaningfully. 3. **Revisit Themes and Motifs**: If your game features recurring themes or motifs, the ending is a place to highlight these one last time, reinforcing the story's messages or lessons. This can provide a deeper sense of closure, as players see the culmination of these ideas. 4. **Player Reflection**: Offer moments for the player to reflect on their journey. This could be through dialogue, monologues, environmental storytelling, or a mechanic that has the player physically revisiting places from their past within the game. This reflection can help encapsulate the journey's significance. 5. **A Sense of Reward**: Players should feel rewarded not just in terms of in-game achievements, but also emotionally. This might mean scenes that celebrate victories, tangible rewards within the game world, or emotional payoffs through character interactions. 6. **Closure for Subplots**: Tie up secondary storylines and subplots, giving minor characters their moments of conclusion. These resolutions contribute to the world feeling complete and lived-in, enhancing the main narrative’s sense of closure. 7. **Leave Intentional Openness Judiciously**: Sometimes, a feeling of everything being \\"said and done\\" can be achieved by intentionally leaving certain elements open but only if it serves a larger purpose, like emphasizing a theme or inviting player speculation. However, this should be done judiciously to avoid feeling like an oversight or loose end. 8. **Post-Climax Content**: After the main climax, include content that confirms the world’s status after the resolution. This could be through epilogues, post-game missions, or dialogues that show how the world and its inhabitants have been affected by the player's actions. This helps solidify the player's impact on the game world. 9. **Reflective Gameplay Mechanics**: Consider including gameplay mechanics that encourage reflection or symbolize closure. An example could be revisiting earlier game locations that now show the consequences of the player's actions, emphasizing their journey's impact on the game world. 10. **Give Time for Goodbyes**: If applicable, allow players to have moments with key characters to say their goodbyes or see where their paths will lead post-game. This can help provide emotional closure. Focusing on narrative completeness, emotional resolution, and rewarding the player's investment will help create an ending where everything feels \\"said and done,\\" giving the player a satisfying sense of conclusion and accomplishment."},{"instruction":"regarding why many fans hated the ending of mass effect 3, would it have been a good idea to have one more choice the player has to make in the middle of the game, and the other half of the game is playing through the consequences of the choice?","output":"The ending of Mass Effect 3 received significant backlash from fans for several reasons, including the feeling that the complex and multifaceted decisions players had made throughout the trilogy did not sufficiently influence the climax. Many felt that the conclusion did not adequately reflect the vast array of choices they had made, reducing the perceived impact of their decisions on the game's world and narrative outcome. Integrating a significant, game-altering choice in the middle of Mass Effect 3, with the latter half of the game dedicated to exploring the ramifications of that decision, could have potentially addressed some of these concerns. This approach offers several benefits: 1. **Increased Player Agency**: Providing a critical choice that clearly divides the narrative would reinforce the trilogy's emphasis on player agency, making gamers feel more in control of the story's direction. 2. **Diverse Narrative Paths**: By fundamentally altering the game's world and how events unfold in the latter half, this approach would allow players to see the direct consequences of their decisions in a more granular and impactful way, enhancing replay value. 3. **Emotional Investment**: Seeing the world and its characters profoundly impacted by a choice made midway would heighten emotional investment. Players would have to consider their decisions carefully, knowing they'd spend substantial time dealing with the outcomes. 4. **Addressing Fan Critiques**: Implementing a major branching point that significantly affects the narrative could have mitigated some of the criticism regarding the ending, by ensuring that at least one major plot point reflected the player’s choices in a substantial way. However, there are also challenges and considerations with this approach: 1. **Development Resources**: Creating essentially two divergent halves of a game from a midpoint decision would require a significant investment in time, money, and development resources, potentially doubling the work needed for story development, voice acting, level design, and more. 2. **Narrative Cohesion**: Maintaining a coherent story while offering dramatically different paths can be challenging. Important themes and character arcs might become diluted or lost if not carefully managed across the divergent narratives. 3. **Player Divisiveness**: While many players appreciate games that offer significantly divergent paths, others might be frustrated if they feel they’ve missed out on a large portion of content due to their choices, leading to potential divisiveness among the player base. 4. **Quality vs. Quantity**: Balancing the depth and quality of divergent storylines can be difficult. There’s a risk of each path feeling underdeveloped compared to a single, more focused narrative. In summary, introducing a significant, game-altering decision midway through Mass Effect 3, with the rest of the game exploring those consequences, is an intriguing idea that could have potentially enhanced the sense of player agency and narrative impact. However, it would also present substantial development challenges and could introduce new criticisms depending on its execution. Ultimately, the effectiveness of such an approach would depend on how well it was integrated into the overall narrative and whether it could maintain the series' thematic and emotional core across diverse paths."},{"instruction":"how can ending missions where the player has to go somewhere and do something alone, having to part ways with their companions be written well?","output":"Ending missions that require the player's character to proceed alone, after having journeyed with companions, present a unique opportunity to heighten emotional impact, explore character development, and emphasize the narrative's themes. Here's how such missions can be written effectively: 1. **Build Up Emotional Stakes**: Prior to the separation, dedicate time to building the emotional stakes. This could involve scenes or dialogues emphasizing the bond between the player's character and their companions, highlighting what's at risk and what's to be gained. The separation should feel like a significant sacrifice or a necessary step for a greater good, not just a gameplay mechanic. 2. **Provide a Strong Motivation**: The reason for the protagonist needing to proceed alone must be compelling and woven into the narrative. Whether it’s because of a physical barrier only the protagonist can bypass, a moral decision only they can make, or a destiny they must face alone, the motivation should feel intrinsic to the story and character arcs. 3. **Highlight Character Growth**: Use this moment to showcase the player character’s growth. Reflect on how they've been shaped by their companions and experiences. This could be demonstrated through dialogue, internal monologue, or even gameplay mechanics that require the player to utilize skills or knowledge gained from their companions throughout the game. 4. **Make the Departure Meaningful**: The farewell with companions should be impactful. Allow for personalized goodbyes that acknowledge the journey shared and the individual relationships forged. These moments can be tailored based on the player's interactions and relationships with each companion, offering a personalized touch that reinforces the game's emphasis on choice and consequence. 5. **Create Atmosphere through Gameplay and Design**: The mission’s design should reflect the protagonist's isolation and the magnitude of their task. This could be through the environment (e.g., more challenging, eerie, or desolate than previous areas), the gameplay mechanics (e.g., disabling certain abilities that relied on companions), or the narrative presentation (e.g., cutscenes or dialogue that emphasize the weight of proceeding alone). 6. **Incorporate Reflection and Anticipation**: Throughout the mission, incorporate elements that allow the player to reflect on their journey and what lies ahead. This can be achieved through environmental storytelling, audio logs, or flashbacks that reinforce the protagonist's purpose and resolve, as well as the influence of their companions. 7. **Ensure a Rewarding Conclusion**: The mission and its challenges should lead to a rewarding conclusion. This doesn’t necessarily mean a happy ending, but the outcome should feel significant and earned, directly reflecting the protagonist's sacrifices and the absence of their companions. This conclusion should tie back to the game’s core themes and character arcs, offering closure or setting the stage for future stories. 8. **Reconnection or Reflection on Companions**: After the mission, provide a moment for the protagonist to reconnect with their companions, reflect on their absence, or reveal how their solo journey has impacted their relationships. This reconnection can take many forms, from a celebratory reunion to a solemn remembrance, depending on the narrative outcome. Writing such missions requires a delicate balance of narrative pacing, emotional depth, and gameplay integration. The key is to reinforce the significance of companionship throughout the game, making the moment of parting, the solitary journey, and the eventual conclusion all the more impactful."},{"instruction":"so in rpgs in general, can making choices actually be impactful if the player actually has to play through the consequences?","output":"Absolutely, having players directly experience the consequences of their choices can significantly enhance the impactfulness and emotional depth of role-playing games (RPGs). This approach not only bolsters player agency—a core appeal of the genre—but also enriches the game world, making it feel more alive and responsive. Here are several reasons why playing through the consequences of choices deepens the gameplay experience: 1. **Increased Immersion**: When players see the tangible outcomes of their decisions affecting the game world, characters, and story, it reinforces the illusion of a living, responsive world. This direct experience of consequence heightens immersion, as players feel genuinely integrated into the narrative. 2. **Emotional Engagement**: Experiencing the outcomes of choices can provoke a wide range of emotions, from pride and satisfaction to guilt and regret. This emotional rollercoaster keeps players emotionally invested in the game and its characters, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. 3. **Enhanced Role-Playing**: For many players, RPGs are an opportunity to explore different aspects of themselves or to experiment with perspectives and moralities different from their own. The ability to make choices and then directly deal with the outcomes allows for a more nuanced exploration of these roles and decisions, contributing to a richer role-playing experience. 4. **Greater Narrative Depth**: A game that incorporates branching narratives with consequential choices allows for complex storytelling that can adapt to reflect different player decisions. This flexibility can lead to multiple endings or vastly different story arcs, offering greater narrative depth and replay value. 5. **Personalized Stories**: When players must deal with the aftermath of their actions, each player's journey becomes unique to their choices. This personalization makes each playthrough feel special and tailored to the individual, fostering a stronger connection to the game’s world and characters. 6. **Accountability and Strategy**: Knowing that choices will have tangible consequences forces players to think more strategically about their decisions. This adds a layer of challenge and complexity to gameplay, as players must consider the potential long-term effects of their actions, not just immediate benefits. 7. **Social and Ethical Considerations**: Games that make players confront the consequences of their decisions can also explore social, ethical, and moral questions in profound ways. This can prompt players to reflect on their beliefs and values, both within the game and in real life. However, implementing such a design philosophy comes with challenges. It requires careful planning to ensure that different narrative branches are meaningful and that the game can logistically support various outcomes without becoming too unwieldy or technically demanding. Developers must find a balance between offering meaningful choices and maintaining a coherent, engaging storyline. In conclusion, making players play through the consequences of their choices significantly enriches the RPG experience, offering deeper immersion, emotional engagement, and narrative complexity. This approach fosters a sense of agency and investment in the game world, making the experience more memorable and impactful."},{"instruction":"for an rpg, what if guards, upon hearing a sound, actually went away from the source of the sound, perhaps getting backup? realistic?","output":"Implementing guard behavior in an RPG where guards move away from the source of a sound to get backup instead of moving towards it could add an interesting layer of realism and strategy to the game, although it diverges from the conventional expectation that guards investigate disturbances directly. Here are some considerations on the realism and implications of such a mechanic: # Realism From a realistic standpoint, guards in certain contexts might indeed choose to retreat and call for backup rather than investigating a potential threat alone. This behavior could be expected in situations where: 1. **The perceived threat is significant**: If the sound implies a substantial threat (e.g., the sound of gunfire as opposed to a knocked-over vase), retreating to get help could be seen as a smart, realistic response. 2. **Protocol dictates**: In some scenarios, especially where guards are part of a well-organized security force, protocol might dictate falling back and calling for reinforcements when encountering potential threats. 3. **The guards are outmatched**: In situations where guards believe they are outgunned or outskilled (perhaps because of prior encounters with the player character), seeking backup could be a more realistic response than facing the threat alone. # Game Design Implications Implementing this guard behavior could significantly impact game design and player experience: 1. **Stealth Gameplay**: This mechanic could introduce a new layer of strategy to stealth gameplay, requiring players to consider how to use noises tactically to manipulate guard movements and control the flow of enemy reinforcements. 2. **Difficulty and Tension**: The game could become more challenging and tense if guards react by consolidating forces, potentially forcing the player to deal with larger groups of enemies or to strategically avoid triggering sound-based alerts. 3. **Environmental Interaction**: Players might need to interact more with the environment, utilizing it not just to hide but to create diversions or control guard movement. This can lead to richer gameplay where players need to think several steps ahead. 4. **AI Development**: Developing AI that realistically responds to sounds by assessing threat levels and deciding between investigating, retreating, or calling for backup would require more sophisticated AI routines than those found in many current games. This could increase game development complexity and costs. 5. **Narrative Integration**: The game world and its narratives should support and explain why guards behave this way, possibly through environmental storytelling, lore, or direct exposition. This can enrich the game world and make it feel more alive and coherent. In summary, having guards retreat to get backup in response to sounds is an interesting and potentially realistic behavior that could enhance RPG gameplay by adding depth to stealth mechanics and enemy AI. However, integrating this behavior would require careful consideration of its impact on game design, difficulty, and player experience, as well as substantial AI development efforts to achieve a believable and engaging implementation."},{"instruction":"for a 3d rpg game, how could a character that is the most important character in the story due to their abilities or destiny be interesting and likeable? Maybe they could actually be down to earth, and enjoy the mundane and simple moments?","output":"Creating a compelling and likable main character in a 3D RPG, especially one who is pivotal to the game's narrative because of their unique abilities or destiny, can be challenging. Striking a balance between making them extraordinary and relatable is key. Here are some strategies to achieve this, including emphasizing their appreciation for mundane and simple moments: # 1. **Humanize Through Flaws and Growth** Characters that are too perfect are often hard to relate to. Giving your character flaws or insecurities, even as they grapple with their destiny or unique abilities, can make them more human and relatable. Their journey can involve learning from mistakes, growing in character, and overcoming personal hurdles, which resonates with players. # 2. **Showcase Humility and Relatability** Despite their importance or power, the character can be designed to exhibit humility and find joy in life’s simpler aspects. They might engage in mundane activities with appreciation, like sharing a meal with companions, enjoying a moment of peace in nature, or showing interest in the lives and worries of non-playable characters (NPCs). These moments can serve to ground the character, making them more likable and relatable. # 3. **Build Deep Relationships** The character's interactions with others can greatly impact how they are perceived. Crafting deep, meaningful relationships with companions and NPCs adds depth to the character. Showing care, empathy, and loyalty in these relationships—even putting others' needs above their own at times—reinforces their likability. # 4. **Incorporate Humor** Humor can be a powerful tool for making characters more endearing. A character who can laugh at themselves, share a joke with friends, or find humor in the absurdity of their situation helps to create a more nuanced and enjoyable persona. # 5. **Allow Vulnerability** Moments of vulnerability can foster a strong connection between the character and the player. Showing doubts, fears, and moments of weakness related to their abilities or destiny makes the character more three-dimensional and engaging. # 6. **Empower Player Choices** Let the player's choices significantly impact how the character responds to their destiny or utilizes their abilities. This makes the character feel less like a predetermined hero and more like an extension of the player, increasing investment in both the character and the story. # 7. **Show Growth in Mundane Skills** Besides their unique abilities or fulfilling destiny, showing that the character also values and works to improve in mundane skills (e.g., cooking, crafting) can make them more grounded and relatable. It demonstrates that they don't see themselves as above ordinary life despite their extraordinary role. # 8. **Balance with Humility** Characters who recognize the limits of their abilities or destiny, and who understand and respect the roles of others in the narrative, tend to be more likable. This humility in the face of grandeur can make even the most powerful characters endearing to the player. # 9. **Involve in Community** Having the character actively participate in and contribute to the communities they encounter reinforces a sense of belonging and down-to-earth qualities. Working on communal farms, aiding in local defenses, or simply playing games with village children are all actions that can enhance their likability. # Conclusion A character's journey in an RPG, especially one destined for greatness or possessing unique powers, becomes truly compelling when they are portrayed with depth, showing appreciation for the simpler, mundane aspects of life alongside their grand adventures. This multifaceted approach not only makes for a more believable and engaging protagonist but also enriches the player's experience, fostering a deeper connection to the story and the world."},{"instruction":"perhaps they can struggle with facing jealously and not having a relatable life?","output":"Absolutely, incorporating struggles such as jealousy and the challenge of leading a life that feels unrelatable to others can add substantial depth to a character, making them more complex and engaging. Here's how these themes can enrich your character's story in a 3D RPG: # 1. **Struggling with Jealousy** - **Normalizing Flaws**: Portray the character experiencing jealousy towards others who lead \\"normal\\" lives or possess traits they see as desirable but unattainable (e.g., anonymity, freedom from destiny). This humanizes the character and makes them more relatable to players, who likely have experienced similar feelings. - **Character Development**: Use these feelings of jealousy as a catalyst for character growth. The character could learn to appreciate their unique path and responsibilities or find ways to bridge the gap between their desires and reality, strengthening their resolve and depth. - **Interpersonal Dynamics**: Exploring how jealousy impacts relationships with companions or NPCs can lead to compelling narrative arcs. It can create conflict, spur dialogue on value and self-worth, and ultimately lead to stronger bonds as characters work through these emotions together. # 2. **Navigating Unrelatable Life** - **Isolation**: Highlight the character's sense of isolation stemming from their unique destiny or abilities. Showcase moments where they struggle to connect with others over common experiences, underscoring the cost of their chosen path. - **Seeking Connection**: Illustrate the character's efforts to bridge the gap between their extraordinary circumstances and the ordinary world. Moments of vulnerability when they share their feelings, or attempt to engage in simple pleasures or tasks with others, can be powerful. - **Societal Impact**: Consider how society views the character. They could be idolized, feared, or misunderstood, adding layers to their interactions and internal conflicts. How they deal with public perception—embracing, rejecting, or challenging it—can add richness to the narrative. # 3. **Integrating Solutions** - **Mentorship and Support**: Introduce characters who guide or support the protagonist in their emotional journey, offering wisdom on handling jealousy, isolation, and the burden of unrelatable experiences. These relationships can be pivotal in demonstrating healthy coping mechanisms and emphasizing the value of community. - **Shared Experiences**: Create scenarios where the character finds common ground with others, perhaps in surprising ways. These shared experiences can help mitigate feelings of jealousy and isolation, reinforcing the game's themes of unity and empathy. - **Embracing Uniqueness**: Develop the narrative so the character gradually accepts their unique position, not as a barrier to relatability, but as an opportunity to foster diverse perspectives and connections. Show the character leveraging their experiences to help others, thereby finding value and relatability in their distinct path. # Conclusion By weaving in struggles like jealousy and the pursuit of relatability into your game's protagonist, you create a character that players can empathize with and root for. These challenges bring authenticity and depth, encouraging players to engage more deeply with the character’s journey and the game's world. Furthermore, addressing and overcoming such relatable hurdles can provide meaningful messages about personal growth, resilience, and the power of understanding, making your RPG a richer and more rewarding experience."},{"instruction":"what if this wasn't the protagonist?","output":"If these struggles—such as dealing with jealousy or living an unrelatable life—belong to a significant non-protagonist character in a 3D RPG, they can still deeply enrich the narrative and gameplay experience. This approach can add layers to the game's world and foster dynamic relationships between characters. Here’s how these elements can be effectively implemented: # Introduce Complex Relationships - **Inter-character Dynamics**: The protagonist's interactions with this character can be shaped by their struggles. Moments of conflict, sympathy, understanding, or assistance between the protagonist and this character can create a more emotionally charged and nuanced narrative. - **Character Arc Influence**: The significant character's journey can parallel or contrast with the protagonist's, influencing the player's perspective on themes like destiny, purpose, and personal fulfillment. Their relationship can evolve as they confront or support each other through these challenges. # Broaden Narrative Scope - **Diverse Perspectives**: Introducing a key character who faces relatable human struggles like jealousy or feelings of alienation broadens the narrative's scope. It shows that heroes and influential figures also grapple with personal issues, making the game world more multifaceted. - **Secondary Questlines**: This character's challenges can inspire secondary questlines where the player helps or hinders their journey, providing gameplay variety and deepening the world's lore and character backstories. # Enrich World Building - **Cultural Reflections**: The character's experiences can reflect broader societal or cultural issues within the game world. Exploring how society contributes to feelings of jealousy or isolation can add depth to the game's setting and drive home thematic messages. - **Community and Support Networks**: Showing how other characters in the game world react to or support this significant character can enrich the portrayal of community dynamics. This not only adds realism but also opportunities for the player to engage in varied interactions. # Offer Player Reflection - **Empathy and Judgment**: By observing and engaging with this character's struggles, players have the chance to reflect on similar feelings in their lives or in the lives of others. This can influence how they view the character and make in-game decisions affecting them. - **Moral Choices**: Presenting the player with moral choices regarding this character—such as whether to exploit their jealousy or help them overcome their isolation—adds complexity to the gameplay and narrative, impacting the game's world, the player's experience, and the character's fate. # Enhance Emotional Depth - **Relatable Vulnerabilities**: Even if the character isn't a protagonist, their vulnerabilities and challenges can make them more relatable and memorable to players, fostering an emotional connection that enriches the overall experience. - **Resonance and Impact**: Seeing a significant character navigate their personal trials and potentially grow or fail can have a lasting impact on players, making the story more resonant and memorable. Incorporating significant characters who encounter deeply human struggles such as jealousy and a sense of disconnection provides an opportunity to create richer, more emotionally complex narratives. It allows for the exploration of themes and relationships that reflect broader human experiences, making the game's world and its inhabitants more engaging and relatable for players."},{"instruction":"what if the 'destiny' is literally engineered?","output":"If a character’s destiny is literally engineered—either through scientific, magical, or any form of advanced manipulation—it opens up a myriad of fascinating narrative and thematic avenues for a 3D RPG. This concept allows for the exploration of free will versus determinism, the ethics of creation and manipulation, and the essence of identity and destiny. Here’s how such a premise could be deeply integrated into game design and storytelling: # Narrative Depth 1. **Origins and Revelations**: The discovery process about the character’s engineered destiny can be a compelling narrative arc. Incremental revelations about who engineered their destiny and why can serve as key plot points that drive the story and the character’s development. 2. **Conflict and Identity**: A character grappling with an engineered destiny may face internal conflict regarding their sense of self. Are they merely a puppet of their creators, or do they possess the agency to define their own path? This struggle can lead to rich character development and relatable themes of self-discovery and autonomy. 3. **Ethical Dilemmas**: Introduce ethical questions about the engineering of destinies. This could involve the perspectives of the engineers (why they did it, their moral justifications, etc.) and society's view on such practices (whether it's seen as an abomination, a miracle, or a common practice). # Gameplay Integration 1. **Choices and Consequences**: Reflect the theme of engineered destiny in the gameplay by providing choices that test the character’s autonomy. Offer morally gray decisions that challenge the player to consider the implications of following their engineered path versus forging a new one. 2. **Abilities**: If the character’s destiny includes engineered abilities or traits, how they use these abilities can tie into the narrative themes. Perhaps using certain abilities reinforces the engineered destiny, while refraining or using them in unintended ways offers paths to autonomy. 3. **Relationships**: The character's relationships with others (creators, those opposed to destiny engineering, fellow engineered beings, etc.) can be influenced by the player's actions and choices, representing the social ramifications of engineered destinies. # Thematic Exploration 1. **Nature vs. Nurture**: Lean into the debate of nature versus nurture. How much of the character’s personality, abilities, and choices are determined by their engineered destiny, and how much can be attributed to their experiences and relationships? 2. **Freedom and Determinism**: Explore themes of freedom vs. determinism through the narrative and gameplay. Can the character truly be free if their destiny is engineered? How does knowledge of their engineered purpose affect their choices and interactions with the world? 3. **Ethics of Creation**: Delve into the ethical considerations of engineering destinies. This can include the responsibilities of creators toward their creations, the societal implications of such practices, and the rights of beings with engineered destinies. 4. **Personal vs. Greater Good**: The character might be engineered for a purpose that serves the greater good—or so their creators believe. This presents an opportunity to explore the balance between individual desires and collective needs. # Conclusion An engineered destiny provides a rich tapestry for storytelling and gameplay, enabling players to navigate through a world filled with moral complexity, existential questions, and the pursuit of identity amidst preordained paths. It challenges players to think about the essence of choice and agency in a world where destinies can be artificially shaped, offering a narrative experience that is both thought-provoking and deeply engaging."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Wstęp Załóżmy, że adres IP serwera jest już znany (możesz go sprawdzić używając komendy \`ip addr\` w konsoli systemu Linux). Jeśli działasz w środowisku lokalnym, prawdopodobnie będzie to \`127.0.0.1\` (localhost). Port, który wybierzesz musi być tak samo skonfigurowany zarówno w aplikacji klienta jak i serwera.

powerful AI image generators capable of creating highly realistic images of humans. The choice of which one to use can depend on factors like the level of detail required, customization capabilities, ease of use, and access conditions (e.g., free vs. paid, software requirements). Here are a few leading AI image generators known for their ability to produce realistic pictures of humans: 1. **Midjourney** (accessible through Discord) - It is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species. Midjourney has rapidly gained popularity for its high-quality images and artistic styles, including realistic human portraits. 2. **DALL-E 2 by OpenAI** - Known for generating highly detailed and creative images from textual descriptions, DALL-E 2 has set a benchmark in the realm of AI image generators. It has shown significant capabilities in generating realistic images of humans, with the ability to modify aspects of existing images or create new ones based on descriptive prompts. 3. **Stable Diffusion** - A latent diffusion model that can generate high-quality images of humans. It is notable for being open-source, allowing for greater customization and experimentation. Stable Diffusion can produce detailed and realistic images based on textual descriptions or edits to existing images. 4. **Artbreeder** (specifically its \\"Portraits\\" feature) - Though not as robust in terms of outright realism when compared to the likes of DALL-E 2 or Midjourney, Artbreeder allows for a high degree of control over the generation process, making it possible to blend features and styles to create realistic or stylized human images. 5. **Craiyon (formerly known as DALL-E mini)** - While not as sophisticated as DALL-E 2 or others mentioned here, Craiyon offers an approachable and free option for generating images of humans. The results might not be as high-fidelity or consistently realistic but can still be quite remarkable. **Considerations:** - **Realism and Ethical Implications**: When creating realistic images of humans, ethical considerations are paramount. This includes respect for individual privacy, avoiding the creation of misleading or harmful content, and adherence to the usage terms of the AI tool you're using. - **Legal Use**: Ensure that your use of AI-generated images, particularly of humans, complies with legal standards and respects copyright and personal rights. Each of these tools has unique strengths, and the best choice may depend on your specific needs, such as whether you're looking for photorealism, artistic flair, or specific customization capabilities. Always check the most current capabilities and terms of use of these platforms, as the field of AI image generation is rapidly evolving."},{"instruction":"Zrealizować komunikację klient-serwer między komputerem (klient) a płytką (serwer).

The protagonist could grapple with the knowledge that their life and struggles might be orchestrated. Players can explore themes of free will versus predestination, the ethics of creating life or scenarios solely for another's development, and the nature of heroism when heroics are prearranged. 2. **Narrative Depth**: Such a storyline allows for numerous layers of narrative depth. There could be stories within stories, as the protagonist uncovers the extent to which their life has been engineered. This could lead to discoveries about who is behind the orchestration and for what purpose, inviting twists and complex character developments. 3. **Player Engagement**: This setup could deeply engage players by directly involving them in unraveling the mystery of their own existence within the game. Finding out why enemies were created for them to fight, or why certain people were placed in their path to be saved, could make for a compelling gameplay loop. This also allows for reflective moments where the player contemplates their actions within the game. 4. **Unique Gameplay Mechanics**: The premise could lead to unique gameplay mechanics. For instance, the protagonist might gain the ability to see behind the curtain, altering engineered scenarios or even rebelling against their predestined path. This could introduce mechanics around choice and consequence, altering story outcomes based on player actions. 5. **Exploration of Identity**: At its heart, such a story is a journey of self-discovery. Players can explore what makes the protagonist a hero: their artificially constructed destiny or the choices they make in spite of knowing their life is a setup. This theme resonates well with broader questions of identity and purpose. 6. **Implications of Artificiality**: If the enemies and scenarios are engineered, what does that say about them? Are they less real, or do they have their own consciousness and struggles? This could introduce a subplot exploring the nature of sentience and what it means to be 'real' in a world where entities are created for a purpose. 7. **Visual and Narrative Variety**: Designing a game world where everything is engineered for the protagonist's destiny allows creative freedom in both visuals and story. Environments can shift dramatically as the creator(s) of the protagonist's path attempt to induce certain experiences or emotions, leading to varied and engaging game design. Overall, approaching this concept with care, ensuring depth and sensitivity around the themes, could result in an engaging, thought-provoking gaming experience that pushes the boundaries of narrative in interactive media."},{"instruction":"building on this, would it also be interesting if the protagonist and the character engineered to be the antagonist fall in love?","output":"Integrating a love story between the protagonist and an engineered antagonist could add another compelling layer to your game, enhancing its emotional depth and complexity. Here are several reasons why this could be interesting: 1. **Complex Relationships**: A romance between the protagonist and their engineered antagonist can introduce nuanced character dynamics. Their relationship could evolve from conflict to understanding and eventually to love, providing a rich narrative arc that unfolds alongside the main plot. This complexity can make characters more relatable and multidimensional. 2. **Internal Conflict**: Both characters might experience intense internal conflict upon discovering their feelings for each other. For the protagonist, realizing they have fallen in love with someone designed to be their enemy could challenge their beliefs and goals. Similarly, the antagonist might struggle with their identity and purpose, questioning their programming or conditioning in the light of these new emotions. 3. **Challenging Predestined Roles**: Their love story could serve as a powerful narrative device to challenge the concept of fate and the artificial boundaries set by those who engineered their destinies. It presents an opportunity for both characters to assert their free will, potentially seeking a way to redefine their roles and create a new path together beyond the confines of their designed narrative. 4. **Themes of Redemption and Forgiveness**: Introducing a romantic relationship between the protagonist and antagonist opens the door to exploring themes of redemption and forgiveness. The antagonist, created to oppose the protagonist, may find redemption through love, prompting questions about the capacity for change and the complexity of morality. Similarly, the protagonist's capacity to forgive and embrace their nemesis can lead to powerful storytelling. 5. **Heightened Stakes**: The stakes of the narrative are naturally elevated when the central conflict involves two characters in love. Their relationship adds a personal dimension to their struggles, making confrontations more emotionally charged and the potential for loss more poignant. Players can become more emotionally invested in the story, driving engagement. 6. **Unpredictable Plot Twists**: A love story between supposed enemies allows for unexpected plot developments. Betrayals, sacrifices, secret alliances, and dramatic confrontations fueled by emotional turmoil could keep players on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating what comes next. 7. **Philosophical and Ethical Questions**: This relationship might prompt players to ponder philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of love, autonomy versus manipulation, and whether true emotions can emerge in beings whose feelings and antagonisms were originally engineered. Incorporating a love story into this narrative framework can make for a rich, emotionally resonant gaming experience that challenges conventional storytelling. It can amplify the game's central themes, adding layers of narrative depth and providing a canvas to explore complex emotional landscapes and human (or non-human) experiences, all while engaging the player on a profoundly personal level."},{"instruction":"阅读下面的评论，总结大家对当前股票的评价，条数不超过15条；并总结；如果有有用的信息，请告诉我： 评论内容 评论时间 这三只股是今年沪深三百成份股跌幅top3，无一例外都是下跌过程中一堆散户抄底，抄 2024-04-21 14:39:43 合理价格，5块。 2024-04-21 15:52:40 2023年9月30日，报告显示，高瓴资本持股广联达4160万股，2023年年报显 2024-04-21 15:03:17 广联达连续2周融资净偿还合计818.55万元 2024-04-21 15:08:42 深股通连续11周净卖出广联达 累计净卖出10.42亿元 2024-04-21 14:13:50 2024投资广联达记录贴 2024-04-15 11:54:44 在即将到来的2024年4月24日，广联达公司（股票代码：002410）将召集股东 2024-04-21 11:41:53 割肉南国置业换这个好像好些。最近砸的太狠。 2024-04-21 10:39:33 需要用一辈子来偿还的债 2024-04-19 15:31:42 这个票砸的也够狠。 2024-04-21 09:37:39 下周必涨无疑，发帖例证。 2024-04-20 19:57:36 市值也不管理管理？最多5亿，现在太高了吧 2024-04-20 23:50:09 目前炒广联达好矛盾啊，又希望他涨，又希望他跌到8.65让我补仓，最理想状态就是广 2024-04-19 17:52:12 赶紧跑，这货没底！！ 2024-04-20 20:16:43 今天这么抗跌下周直奔13前高 2024-04-19 17:45:16 我装个币，下周一涨停，我说的，耶稣也挡不住 2024-04-20 11:33:33 广联达:关于使用自有闲置资金进行委托理财的公告 2024-03-25 18:27:22 我也装个逼，政府补贴除外一季报亏损，半年报出来之前股价破八块，已经很保守了 2024-04-20 11:17:06 这个票是套北向最凶的一个票里面全部散户[大笑][大笑][大笑] 2024-04-20 10:12:48 我来给大家做做按摩，现在的广联达已经从建筑造价软件转变为了通用设计及造价软件，打 2024-04-19 14:15:15 广联达04月19日获深股通增持170.95万股 2024-04-20 04:14:41 庄这是第一天出货，相对安全，一定有高点。 2024-04-18 09:55:51 是否有24日去参加股东大会的股友？一起约一下！ 2024-04-19 19:34:07 为什么大盘红也跌，绿也跌 2024-04-18 14:26:20 最痛心疾首的反思我现在做出，最痛心疾首的反思。从现在开始，永不碰大市值！永不碰白 2024-04-15 08:04:59 深交所向广联达科技股份有限公司发出监管函 2024-04-12 18:45:09 转发 2024-04-19 20:02:08 定于2024年4月24日，广联达公司（股票代码：002410）将召开本年度的股东 2024-04-19 17:46:53 希望下周广联达能插针到8.65，不想把遗憾留到节后，补仓后估计成本可以达到12左 2024-04-19 16:50:58 今天世贸股份以0.88元一股清仓了，退市风险太大世贸最终亏损4.7万元，目前部分 2024-04-19 16:41:43 需要用一生来偿还 2024-04-19 15:32:30 市值50亿都算高[俏皮][献花] 2024-04-19 09:47:51 研发的钱拿来稳价格不过分吧毕竟保住鸡才会有蛋 2024-04-19 14:48:19 10元以下坚定加仓，一季报只有几天了，看好公司发展 2024-04-19 10:21:01 刚买就套我两个多点，亏了五百 2023-07-20 17:45:09 兄弟们9.62跌破，一定要割，不然就要到6块了，炒股一定设置止损，3个点必割，不 2024-04-19 11:24:40 大散集中营 2024-04-19 14:03:04 今天是洗盘，收集筹码，预测收盘价10.20元 2024-04-19 13:29:00 有本事你就翻红呀 2024-04-19 13:05:37 9.95刚卖完，然后一路狂奔，卧槽 2024-04-19 11:37:31 真是一点都不能格局 2024-04-19 10:29:20 10元以上这股就没有人愿意买了，还要到跌8元 2024-04-19 11:25:43 今天又买在山顶上了 2024-04-19 11:12:18 加数下跌了，两天出货差不多了吧 2024-04-19 11:23:50 真的是什么时候卖都是高点呀 2024-04-19 10:30:40 根据2024－2025世界金融体系运行推断，世界经济标准预测机构分析，广达预计5 2024-04-19 11:14:50 我笑了。哈哈哈 2024-04-19 11:09:58 这个位置那来的货出，大忽悠一个 2024-04-19 09:54:44 广联达(SZ002410) 2024-04-19 10:22:20 一定会跌出你的价值 2024-04-19 10:47:01 你要抄底，股东就给你筹码，根本卖不完 2024-04-19 10:21:18 彻底服了，这儿 2024-04-19 10:14:18 出货完，就来跟大阴线，新低。这走势 2024-04-19 10:03:06 中国股市十年一个大行情，熬过去，拿住股票捂住钱，明年就翻身 2024-04-19 10:00:15 广联达10元是未来的顶 2024-04-19 09:35:20 10.15清仓。 2024-04-19 09:47:11 这个洗盘真的很厉害，大行情要来了 2024-04-19 09:38:50 还能怎么办，继续加 2024-04-19 09:36:00 你吗。天天跌 2024-04-19 09:35:48 11的本，啥时候能回本 2024-04-18 18:05:27 前提给了割肉逃跑的机会，没有这洗，认栽 2024-04-19 09:34:13 广联达：融资净偿还447.13万元，融资余额4.65亿元（04-18） 2024-04-19 08:57:01 广联达04月18日被深股通减持529.18万股 2024-04-19 04:27:50 来吧我还是赚钱的 2024-04-18 14:35:01 广联达与中豫建投集团签署战略合作协议 2024-04-18 21:28:36 发利好砸盘就是犯罪 2024-04-18 23:46:36 追一点，赌涨停 2024-04-17 14:40:07 广联达：融资净偿还369.92万元，融资余额4.7亿元（04-17） 2024-04-18 09:00:03 我明天开始慢慢建仓 2024-04-18 20:56:53 是选择退市了吗？ 2024-04-18 10:37:19 看到成本20以上的人还在坚守我就放心了，我15的本肯定可以回本，你们就是坚持下去 2024-04-18 09:22:17 短线弹弹是因为跌到太猛了，别入戏太深，别信那些未来10倍百倍的画饼价值，他们不会 2024-04-18 16:31:20 这股除了退市还有更高企盼么 2024-04-18 15:22:18 一根大阳线千军万马来相见的场面哪去了？非要下来接我，我不会上车，你站上20日线我 2024-04-18 15:14:58 真他的给涨一天能跌到最低，[怒][怒][成交][成交][成交] 2024-04-18 15:12:32 为什么看好广联达 2024-04-15 23:23:03 一阳必出三阴，三天会把阳线消完 2024-04-18 15:06:16 垃圾呀 2024-04-18 14:52:49 深股通开始减持！[呲牙][呲牙][呲牙] 2024-04-18 14:41:12 绩效不行，不走还是被套 2024-04-18 14:39:47","output":"综合大家对当前股票的评价，可以总结如下： 1. 广联达是今年沪深300成份股跌幅top3之一，抄底者众多； 2. 有投资者认为合理价格应该在5块左右； 3. 高瓴资本持股广联达，但深股通连续净卖出； 4. 存在对公司市值高估的看法； 5. 有人认为广联达砸盘够狠，需要用一生来偿还债务； 6. 投资者对广联达未来发展态度矛盾，希望涨又希望跌； 7. 部分投资者认为广联达接近底部，预计未来有上涨空间； 8. 有人认为应割肉离开，认为股票没有底线； 9. 投资者对广联达未来价格波动存在不确定性，有人持续关注市场动向。 有用信息：对于个人投资者而言，应该做好充分的风险评估，谨慎对待股票市场的波动，同时关注公司的基本面和市场变化，以便做出正确的投资决策。"},{"instruction":"karl marx impact on the political sciences","output":"Karl Marx's impact on political sciences has been profound and enduring. As a philosopher, economist, and revolutionary socialist, Marx developed theories about society, economics, and politics collectively understood as Marxism. His critique of capitalism and his theory of historical materialism have fundamentally shaped the fields of political science, sociology, economics, and history. # Historical Materialism and the Class Struggle One of Marx's central contributions to political science is his theory of historical materialism. He argued that the material conditions of society's mode of production shape its social structures and political institutions. According to Marx, history is characterized by class struggle, a conflict that drives societal change. This perspective introduced a way of understanding political and social changes through the lens of economic and class dynamics rather than purely through political ideologies or decisions by great men. # Critique of Capitalism Marx's critique of capitalism is another area where his impact on political science is evident. He believed that capitalism inherently leads to the exploitation of the working class, creating a significant divide between the bourgeoisie (owners of production) and the proletariat (working class). Marx argued that this exploitation would inevitably lead to class consciousness among workers, fostering a revolutionary change towards a classless, communist society. This perspective has influenced a wide range of political theories and movements advocating for socialism and communism. # Influence on Political Movements and Ideologies Marx's ideas have directly influenced various political ideologies, movements, and states throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Marxist theory has been foundational for socialist and communist movements around the world, impacting revolutions and the establishment of socialist and communist states. Moreover, Marxist thought has influenced academic disciplines, leading to the development of Marxist sociology, economics, and history, which emphasize class struggle, economic exploitation, and the dialectical development of society. # The Development of Critical Theory Marx's emphasis on critiquing the economic and social structures of society has also contributed to the development of critical theory, particularly within the Frankfurt School. Critical theorists expanded on Marx's ideas, applying critique to a broader range of societal structures, including culture, ideology, and communication, to understand and challenge power dynamics within capitalist societies. # Legacy and Criticism Marx's ideas have, of course, been subject to intense debate, criticism, and revision. Critics argue that Marxist theory's predictions about the inevitability of capitalism's collapse and the subsequent rise of a classless society have not materialized as expected. In contrast, supporters highlight the ways in which Marx's analysis of capitalism and class struggle continue to provide valuable insights into global economic inequalities, labor exploitation, and the concentration of wealth. In conclusion, Karl Marx's impact on political sciences is significant and multifaceted. His theories have provided a framework for analyzing political, economic, and social structures through the lens of class and economic dynamics. While not universally accepted, Marx's ideas continue to influence political science research, discussions, and political movements around the world."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Поскольку мы имеем 30 букв для обозначения инициалов (имя и отчество), всего возможных уникальных комбинаций инициалов будет (30^2 = 900).

Являются ли функции инъекциями, сюрьекциями, биекциями? Существует ли обратная функция?\\"","output":"Давайте разберём заданные функции (f(x) = 2x - 4) и (g(x) = |x^2 + 2x - 3|) по отдельности и определим, являются ли они инъекциями, сюрьекциями или биекциями. Также проверим существование обратных функций для них. # Функция (f(x) = 2x - 4) Инъекция: Функция является инъекцией, если разные элементы домена (области определения) отображаются в разные элементы кодомена (области значений). Для линейной функции (f(x) = 2x - 4), коэффициент при (x) не равен нулю, поэтому она является инъекцией, так как для любых двух различных значений (x_1) и (x_2) значения (f(x_1)) и (f(x_2)) тоже будут различными. Сюрьекция: Функция является сюрьекцией (на всю область значений), если каждый элемент из кодомена является образом хотя бы одного элемента из домена. Рассматривая (f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R}), можно утверждать, что функция сюрьективна, так как для любого значения (y) из области значений существует соответствующий (x) из области определения, полученный из уравнения (y = 2x - 4). Биекция: Поскольку функция одновременно и инъективна, и сюрьективна, она является биекцией. Обратная функция: Для биективной функции существует обратная функция. Найдём её. Если (y = 2x - 4), тогда (x = frac{y + 4}{2}). Таким образом, обратная функция (f^{-1}(y) = frac{y + 4}{2}). # Функция (g(x) = |x^2 + 2x - 3|) Инъекция: Эта функция не является инъекцией. Модуль делает все отрицательные результаты положительными. Также квадратный трёхчлен может принимать одинаковые значения для разных (x). Например, (g(0) = |-3| = 3) и (g(-2) = |4 - 4 - 3| = 3). Таким образом, разные элементы домена отображаются в один и тот же элемент кодомена. Сюрьекция: Эта функция не является сюрьективной по отношению к (mathbb{Z}), так как, хотя область значений (g(x)) включает в себя все неотрицательные целые числа, не для каждого значений (y in mathbb{Z}) найдётся соответствующий (x) из (mathbb{Z}), который бы удовлетворял (|x^2 + 2x - 3| = y), особенно учитывая чёткие ограничения модуля. Например, некоторые отрицательные целые числа не могут быть получены в виде (|x^2 + 2x - 3|). Биекция: Поскольку функция (g(x)) не является ни инъективной, ни сюрьективной, она не может быть биекцией. Обратная функция: Для (g(x)) обратная функция не существует, поскольку она не является биективной. Итоговый вывод: - (f(x)) является биекцией, для неё существует обратная функция. - (g(x)) не является биекцией, для неё обратная функция не существует."},{"instruction":"Выберите справедливые утверждения для данного отношения на множестве хвойных деревьев: \\"... не такое зеленое, как ...\\" Вопрос 2Выберите один или несколько ответов: Отношение рефлексивно Отношение эквивалентности Отношение кососимметрично Отношение симметрично Отношение частичного порядка Отношение транзитивно","output":"Отношение, заданное выражением \\"... не такое зеленое, как ...\\", означает сравнение двух хвойных деревьев на основе их зелёности. Рассматривая данное отношение, анализ его свойств будет следующим: - **Рефлексивность**. Отношение **не является рефлексивным**, так как дерево не может быть менее зелёным по сравнению с самим собой. - **Симметричность**. Отношение **не является симметричным**. Если дерево A менее зелёное, чем дерево B, это не означает, что B менее зелёное, чем A. - **Кососимметричность (Антисимметричность)**. Отношение **может считаться кососимметричным**, поскольку если дерево A не такое зеленое, как дерево B, и дерево B не такое зеленое, как дерево A, то это подразумевает, что они одинаково зелёные, но это прямо противоречит определению данного отношения (в данном контексте, кососимметричность сложно применить, так как мы исходим из предположения не равной зелености, но технически, из-за специфики отношения, такие случаи не возникнут). - **Транзитивность**. Отношение **является транзитивным**. Если дерево A менее зелёное, чем дерево B, и дерево B менее зелёное, чем дерево C, то дерево A менее зелёное, чем дерево C. - **Отношение эквивалентности**. Для того чтобы отношение являлось отношением эквивалентности, оно должно быть рефлексивным, симметричным и транзитивным. Данное отношение не соответствует этим критериям. - **Отношение частичного порядка**. В теории, отношение может быть воспринято как форма частичного порядка (если игнорировать проблему с рефлексивностью и антисимметричностью), так как оно обладает транзитивностью. Тем не менее, чистое отсутствие рефлексивности и четкой антисимметричности делает это утверждение спорным. Таким образом, из перечисленных свойств точно подходит только: - Отношение транзитивно С другими свойствами есть определенные неясности и зависимости от интерпретации, но строго говоря, данный пример не идеально подходит ни под одно из классических отношений порядка или эквивалентности из-за своих особенностей в определении."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Эта ось проходит через две точки на поверхности Земли: Северный и Южный полюсы. Вращение Земли вокруг своей оси происходит примерно за 24 часа, что формирует суточное вращение планеты. Наклон полярной оси Земли относительно её орбиты вокруг Солнца составляет примерно 23,5 градуса. Этот наклон является ключевым фактором, обуславливающим сезонные изменения, поскольку разные части земного шара в разное время года получают разное количество солнечного света.

This concept taps into a variety of engaging thematic elements and fears, including: 1. **Virtual Reality and the Blurring of Lines** between the digital and real world. The idea of being trapped in a virtual environment is relevant in our increasingly digital age, creating a strong resonance with contemporary audiences. 2. **Identity and Self-Perception**: The notion of characters discovering they are not who or what they thought they were opens a rich vein of narrative exploration regarding identity, consciousness, and the nature of self. 3. **Control and Freedom**: The theme of characters trying to regain control over their lives and escape a digital prison can create a powerful narrative drive, appealing to a universal desire for freedom and autonomy. 4. **Mystery and Discovery**: Unraveling the truth behind their existence, exploring the virtual world to find escape or answers, and understanding how and why they were trapped can provide a compelling throughline for the game, keeping players engaged with the story. 5. **Ethical and Societal Commentary**: Such a plot can also allow for commentary on issues such as privacy, the ethics of A.I. and virtual reality, and the potential consequences of technology's overreach in our personal lives. Given these elements, a game with this premise has the potential to be both entertaining and thought-provoking, with opportunities for deep storytelling, emotional engagement, and thrilling gameplay. Moreover, it could cater to fans of multiple genres, including sci-fi, mystery, and horror/thriller, making it appealing to a broad audience.

Subtly implying this twist requires careful planning and deliberate dispersion of hints throughout the game. Here are some ways to achieve this: # Background Dissonance - **Inconsistencies in Behavior**: NPCs exhibiting behaviors or emotions that seem oddly complex or out-of-character, such as expressing fear of \\"disappearing\\" (i.e., being deleted) or showing awareness of their repetitive cycles. - **Memory Flashes**: Occasionally, an NPC might have brief flashes of memory or reference experiences that seem out of place or suggest a past life outside the game world. # Environmental Clues - **Glitches in the Matrix**: Introduce subtle glitches when interacting with certain NPCs. These could be visual (flickers) or auditory (a brief static or a voice distortion) that hint at underlying issues in their programming or existence. - **Diaries or Logs**: Scatter hidden diaries, logs, or digital correspondences throughout the game. These documents could hint at the real-world origins of the NPCs, their awareness of their situation, or cryptic plans to escape their virtual confinement. # NPC Dialogue and Behavior - **Unexplained Knowledge**: Some NPCs might hint at knowledge they shouldn't possess, such as details about the outside world, the nature of their existence, or the player's own real-life actions. - **Requests for Help**: Occasionally, NPCs could veer off-script dramatically, making vague or desperate pleas for help that seem incongruent with their in-game role. # Disrupted Narratives - **Erratic Quests**: Design a quest that inexplicably cancels or changes, with the NPC giving an emotional or panicked response that hints at their fear of being punished for deviating from their assigned role. - **Meta References**: Introduce subtle meta-references through NPC dialogue or game world elements that hint at the existence of a reality beyond the game’s universe. # Game Mechanics - **Character Customization Anomalies**: Enable a feature where players can customize or upgrade NPCs in some way. During this process, rare, unexplained glitches could occur, suggesting that the NPCs are resisting the changes because their true selves are surfacing. - **Dream Sequences**: Utilize cutscenes or playable dream sequences from the viewpoint of NPCs that do not align with their in-game persona, subtly implying their consciousness exists beyond their programmed role. # Integration with Gameplay - **Player's Actions Affect NPC Awareness**: The player’s decisions could slowly influence the awareness and behaviors of the NPCs. For instance, choosing to share certain information or making unconventional gameplay choices could gradually awaken the trapped consciousness within an NPC. Engaging players with these subtleties requires a balance. The clues must be obscure enough not to give away the twist too early but also potent enough to form a coherent picture upon the reveal. This balancing act ensures player engagement through mystery and discovery, leading to a more rewarding narrative experience when the true nature of the NPCs is finally unveiled."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:j,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function F(i,e,l,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),n(v,null,b(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
