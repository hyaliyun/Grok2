The basic annelid form consists of multiple segments. Each segment has the same sets of organs and, in most polychaetes, has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion. Septa separate the segments of many species, but are poorly defined or absent in others, and Echiura and Sipuncula show no obvious signs of segmentation. In species with welldeveloped septa, the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels, and the vessels in segments near the front ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as hearts. The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments, which facilitates movement by peristalsis (ripples that pass along the body) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia. In species with incomplete septa or none, the blood circulates through the main body cavity without any kind of pump, and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques – some burrowing species turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves through the sediment.

In fact, whereas you'll use around 20 gallons (76 L) of water hand washing a load in the sink, the dishwasher will only use 4.5 gallons (17 L). Some dishwashers are also equipped with special fast or economy cycles that use even less water, and these are ideal for lightly soiled dishes. Even if you use a watersaving dishwasher, it’s still important to wait until the appliance is full before turning it on. This is because the dishwasher uses the same amount of water no matter how full it is, so you can maximize water use by only running full loads. When you do have to wash dishes by hand, you can save water by putting in the plug and filling the basin with soapy water rather than leaving the water running. Only fill the sink with as much water as you need to wash the dishes. Similarly, rinse dishes in a sink full of clean water rather than running water over them.

A roux is a simple mixture of flour and fat, traditionally butter, that is used to thicken sauces and stews. To make a roux, begin by melting the butter in a separate skillet. Once the butter is melted, gradually add in the flour, stirring constantly to ensure that the mixture is smooth and free of any lumps. Once the flour and butter are combined, it is time to add in the spices. This is where you can get creative as there are many different spices and herbs that can be used to add flavor to your roux. Some popular options include garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and paprika. Feel free to experiment and see which spices work best for your particular recipe. After the spices have been added, it is time to start gradually adding in the cooking liquid, which can be anything from stock to water to milk depending on the recipe. Be sure to ladle in the liquid slowly, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. As you add in the liquid, the roux will start to thicken and take on a velvety, smooth texture. Once the desired consistency has been reached, the roux can be added to the main dish. Some dishes benefit from a lighter, thinner roux while others require a thicker, more substantial one. This is something that should be considered when preparing any dish that calls for a roux. Overall, making a roux is a great way to add depth and richness to any dish. With a little practice and experimentation, you can master the art of making a good roux and take your cooking to the next level."},{"instruction":"Which is this about?

One important step is to identify which birds may need to be quarantined. This can include birds that have come from an unknown or untrusted source, birds that have been exposed to sick birds, or birds that are showing signs of illness themselves. Once you have identified the birds that need to be quarantined, it is important to take your new bird to the vet for a checkup. This will ensure that your new bird is healthy and doesn't pose a risk to your existing bird(s). The vet may recommend some specific quarantine measures depending on the bird's health and the situation. After the vet visit, it's time to start the quarantine process. This involves keeping your new bird separate from your existing bird(s) for a certain amount of time. This allows you to observe the new bird for any signs of illness and prevent any potential transmission of diseases to your existing bird(s). Quarantine times vary depending on the bird and the situation but can range from a few weeks to several months. During the quarantine period, it is important to keep your new bird in a separate room or area away from your existing bird(s). Make sure to use separate food and water dishes for each bird and wash your hands thoroughly after handling the birds or their belongings. Maintaining a clean and sterile environment will help prevent the spread of illnesses. In conclusion, introducing a new bird to your home requires care and consideration to prevent the spread of diseases to your existing bird(s). Identify which birds need to be quarantined, take your new bird to the vet, and maintain a quarantine area to carefully observe your new bird's health before introducing them to your existing bird(s)."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? sorrowful lows OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"negative"},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

Within just a few days of its release, the new set of figures, which includes a female scientist, an astronomer, and a palaeontologist with a dinosaur, was sold out worldwide. What makes the Research Institute so special is that it's the first LEGO set to feature professional women in the fields of science.

Given the historic under-representation of women in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math), this set is a significant step forward in terms of diversity and representation in the toy industry. By featuring female scientists, the Research Institute is helping to break down some of the traditional gender barriers that have kept women and girls from pursuing careers in these fields.

This can prevent accidental ignition and can help protect those around you. Finally, do not attempt to relight any fireworks that do not go off. This is a dangerous practice and can result in injury. Instead, wait at least 20 minutes before approaching the firework and dispose of it properly. In summary, following these basic safety instructions can help ensure a safe and enjoyable fireworks experience. By reading instructions, paying attention to the weather, wearing safety gear, keeping extra charges or fuse away from the launch area, and never relighting a firework, you can reduce the risk of injury and enjoy a successful launch."},{"instruction":"What are the various ways through which one can earn money online?

Game company requires constant Internet connection to work, he says. Digital rights management meant to protect content, but consumers suffer, he says. Deleon: Hackers can, and do, break through content protections anyway.","output":"Nicholas Deleon, a technology writer, warns that game rights management can prevent users from playing games. A game rights management system, also known as digital rights management (DRM), is used by game companies to protect their content from theft and piracy. However, Deleon argues that this system can be more of a hindrance to consumers than a protection. According to Deleon, some game rights management systems require a constant internet connection to work. This is disadvantageous for people who travel often or have limited internet access. Not only does this limit where consumers can play their games, but it could also lead to gameplay interruptions if the internet connection drops. Deleon also claims that DRM can prevent people from playing their own legally purchased games if they don't meet certain requirements, such as being logged in to a specific account. He says this can be frustrating and unfair for consumers who paid for the game but are unable to play it due to the restrictions. Furthermore, Deleon notes that hackers are often able to circumvent DRM systems, making it ineffective in preventing piracy. This means that legitimate consumers are bearing the brunt of the damage caused by DRM, while pirates and hackers continue to share and enjoy the game without restrictions. In conclusion, while digital rights management was initially intended to be a safeguard against piracy and theft, Nicholas Deleon makes a strong argument that the system is more harmful than helpful to consumers. From limiting gameplay to creating unnecessary restrictions, Deleon suggests that game companies should revisit their control of the implementation of DRM."},{"instruction":"Which is this about?

Consider canceling your TV service.","output":"In a world where material possessions and constant entertainment are constantly pushed as necessary components to a fulfilling life, it can be difficult to let go of either of these things. However, taking steps to reduce your collection and consider canceling your TV service can lead to new opportunities for growth and a more intentional lifestyle. First, it's important to take stock of your belongings and evaluate what truly brings value to your life. This can range from clothes to books to sentimental items. By reducing your collection, you not only free up physical space, but also mental space. A cluttered physical space can create a cluttered mind, leading to feelings of stress and anxiety. By simplifying your possessions, you can create a more calming living environment. Once you have pared down your belongings, it's important to assign specific spaces for each item. This not only makes it easier to find what you need, but also helps to prevent accumulation of extra items. By having specific spaces, you are more mindful of what you bring into your home and less likely to hold onto items that don't serve a purpose. As for canceling your TV service, this may seem like a daunting task, especially if you are used to having access to constant entertainment. However, by doing so, you create more time for other activities, such as reading or spending time outdoors. It's also an opportunity to take control of your consumption of media by choosing when and what to watch, rather than being bombarded with content. In conclusion, taking steps to reduce your collection and cut back on constant entertainment can lead to a more intentional and fulfilling lifestyle. By freeing up space, assigning specific spaces for possessions, and choosing to cancel your TV service, you open up new opportunities for growth and mental clarity."},{"instruction":"f Four individuals walk down a street, with two holding hands and one holding a guitar., can we conclude Four people are walking outside together.?

In a memo sent out to all officers, they were reminded to \\"use common sense\\" when posting online. This reminder comes after a captain within the NYPD posted insensitive tweets about a woman who was killed on the subway, sparking outrage on social media. The captain's tweets were seen as insensitive and uncaring, leading to calls for disciplinary action. Another online controversy involving the NYPD was the '#myNYPD' thread on Twitter. The thread was supposed to celebrate the NYPD and show them in a positive light, however, it quickly backfired when users posted images of alleged police brutality. The images showed officers using excessive force and mistreating civilians, leading to a public relations nightmare for the department. In response to these incidents, the NYPD has reminded their officers to think before they post online, and to consider the potential consequences of their actions. They have also emphasized the need to treat everyone with respect and dignity, both in person and online. It is important for law enforcement agencies to be aware of their online presence and the impact it can have on their reputation. Social media is a powerful tool that can be used to connect with the community and build trust, but it can also be a double-edged sword if not used appropriately.

Double Platinum and Diamond are two of the most prestigious certifications. However, there remains a question amongst music enthusiasts as to which certification requires fewer copies to be sold. The answer is that Diamond certification requires fewer copies to be sold than Double Platinum certification. To be exact, an album needs to sell 10 million units to gain a Diamond certification, whereas an album needs to sell two million units to gain Double Platinum status. The certification process is carried out by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. The RIAA awards Diamond certification to an album that sells 10 million or more copies, whereas Double Platinum is awarded to those albums that sell two million copies or more. The criteria for Diamond certification were established in 1999 when the RIAA introduced the Diamond Award to formalize the recognition of albums that reach 10 million units in the U.S. Since then, several albums have gone on to achieve Diamond certification, including Michael Jackson’s \\"Thriller,\\" Fleetwood Mac’s \\"Rumours,\\" and Shania Twain’s \\"Come On Over.\\" Double Platinum, on the other hand, is a certification that acknowledges an album’s success but is not as prestigious as Diamond certification. To qualify for Double Platinum certification, an album must sell two million copies in the United States. Double Platinum is still an impressive achievement for an artist and signifies significant commercial success. In conclusion, Diamond certification requires fewer copies to be sold than Double Platinum certification. Despite this fact, achieving double platinum certification is still an impressive feat for any artist. Diamond certification remains the holy grail for artists, signifying massive commercial success and longevity in the music industry."},{"instruction":"– What one astronomer calls a rare astronomical phenomenon will play out on Monday.

This edict allowed the Japanese aristocracy to adopt the Tang dynasty political structure, bureaucracy, culture, religion, and philosophy. As part of the Taihō Code, of 702 AD, and the later Yōrō Code, the population was required to report regularly for census, a precursor for national conscription. With an understanding of how the population was distributed, Emperor Mommu introduced a law whereby 1 in 3–4 adult males was drafted into the national military. These soldiers were required to supply their own weapons, and in return were exempted from duties and taxes.

Repeat the sequence to the end of the row.","output":"In the world of crochet, one of the most basic stitches is the single crochet stitch. This stitch requires a few foundational skills such as knowing how to chain and turn your work. The process of chaining is essentially creating a series of loops with your yarn that will serve as the foundation for your single crochet stitches. After chaining your desired number of stitches, it's time to turn your work. Turning your work marks the end of one row and the beginning of the next. This may seem like a simple step, but it's crucial in order to create a consistent and even pattern. To turn your work, you'll want to simply rotate it so that you're ready to begin working on the next row. This means that the loops that were previously facing you will now be facing away from you, and vice versa. Once you've turned your work, it's time to repeat the sequence to the end of the row. This involves inserting your hook into the second chain from the hook, yarn over, pull through, yarn over again, and finally pull through the two loops on your hook. This sequence creates a single crochet stitch, and you'll continue repeating it until you reach the end of the row. By mastering the foundation skills of chaining and turning your work, you'll be on your way to creating beautiful crocheted pieces.

This period is commonly referred to as the Holodomor, which translates to “death by hunger” in Ukrainian. The famine was a direct result of Soviet agricultural policies, which prioritized industrialization and collectivization over the needs of the people. The government seized privately owned land and forced peasants to work on large collective farms, where they lacked the resources and incentives to produce sufficient crops. Additionally, Stalin's regime exported grain to boost revenue for industrialization projects and to establish trade relationships with other countries. As a result, a drought in 1932 led to a devastating food shortage. The government refused to acknowledge the severity of the situation and actively prevented foreign aid from entering the country. They imposed strict penalties for hoarding food, making it illegal for people to save grain for personal use. Starvation and malnutrition were rampant, and reports of cannibalism surfaced in some areas. It is estimated that between 5 and 10 million people died as a result of the famine. However, the exact number is difficult to determine due to the Soviet government’s suppression of information and denial of the famine’s existence. In conclusion, the famine in Russia that killed between 5 and 10 million people lasted for about one to two years between 1932 and 1933. Its devastating impact on the affected regions cannot be denied, and it serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of misguided policy decisions and the human cost of political ambition."},{"instruction":"when was canada's first railway line opened??","output":"Canada's first railway line was opened on July 21, 1836."},{"instruction":"Joe slapped Jose in the face because he was angry.

Martinez admitted to groping two women in their 80s and 90s while bathing them at St Louisarea nursing homes.

Among them include rape, sodomy, and sexual assault. However, his victims had either passed away or were suffering from dementia, making it difficult for them to provide coherent testimonies. As a result, prosecutors were left with no choice but to reduce the charges to four misdemeanor counts of third-degree elder abuse. The case became even more distressing when Martinez admitted to groping two elderly women in their 80s and 90s while bathing them at nursing homes in the St Louis area. This confession led to an outcry from the family members of the victims and the public at large, who felt that Martinez's actions were reprehensible and completely unacceptable. To make matters worse, a third woman came forward to file charges of sodomy and rape against Martinez. However, this woman passed away before the trial could proceed. This was indeed a tragic situation for her family, who had to come to terms with the fact that justice might never be done for their loved one. It is an unfortunate reality that elder abuse is prevalent in many nursing homes and care facilities. This type of abuse can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and financial abuse. The victims are often vulnerable, and their abusers take advantage of their inability to defend themselves. The case of Walter Javier Martinez serves as a stark reminder that elder abuse is a serious issue that must be addressed promptly. It's crucial that caregivers and loved ones remain vigilant, and that they report any signs of abuse immediately. Additionally, nursing homes and care facilities must do more to protect their residents from harm and ensure that those who perpetrate abuse face justice."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Kate Capshaw (a k a Mrs. Steven Spielberg) stars in a soso romantic comedy about an older divorced woman whose life is changed by the discovery of a love letter.

It usually includes nail stickers in various designs, a cuticle pusher, a nail file, and a top coat. Some kits may also include nail polish remover pads and a mini LED lamp to dry the stickers quickly. The first step to using a nail sticker kit is to prepare your nails. Make sure your nails are clean and dry before applying any stickers. Use the cuticle pusher to push back your cuticles and use the nail file to shape your nails. This will not only ensure a smoother application but will also make your nails look neat and tidy. Next, choose the nail sticker design you want to use and carefully peel it off the sheet. Place the sticker onto your nail and press down firmly. Smooth out any wrinkles or bubbles with the flat end of the cuticle pusher. Repeat this step for all your nails. Once all your nails have been covered with stickers, apply a top coat to seal the design in place. This will also give your nails a glossy finish and protect the stickers from chipping or peeling off. By using a nail sticker kit, you can achieve a professional-looking manicure at home without any fuss. Plus, with so many designs to choose from, you can mix and match to create your own unique nail art.

Whether you are a professional singer, public speaker, or podcaster, taking care of your voice is crucial to maintain its quality and longevity. Here are some tips for maintaining good vocal health. First and foremost, stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water is one of the best things you can do to keep your voice healthy. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water daily, and avoid sugary or caffeinated drinks that can dehydrate your vocal cords. In addition to drinking water, eat hydrating snacks, like fruits and vegetables that are high in water content, to keep your vocal cords from drying out. Avoid consuming alcohol, caffeine, excessive sugar or acidity, which can irritate and dry out your vocal cords. Yelling and screaming can cause strain and injury to your vocal cords. Avoid these activities if possible, and if you must speak loudly, use proper vocal techniques and take frequent breaks. Clearing your throat is another habit to avoid. It can lead to vocal cord irritation and inflammation. Instead, try coughing to clear your throat or sipping water. Maintain a comfortable humidity level in your home or workspace by using a humidifier. Dry air can irritate your vocal cords, making them more susceptible to injury. Finally, don't smoke. Smoking not only damages your lungs, but it also harms your voice. Smoking dries out the vocal cords and can lead to throat irritation and inflammation.

However, this news is not being welcomed by environmentalists who fear that hundreds of wolves could now be killed by ranchers. Ranchers have long complained about wolves attacking their livestock and threaten their way of life. One rancher interviewed by CNN claimed that the wolves pose a significant threat to his livelihood. He argued that wolves are killing his cattle and sheep, and he can’t afford to continue raising them with such losses. On the other hand, environmentalists are concerned that lifting the protections could mean that the gray wolf could face significant threats in the near future. They fear that with no endangered status to protect them, ranchers, hunters, and homeowners will now feel free to hunt down the wolfs on sight. Sadly, this is a common issue that arises when wildlife regulations get relaxed. While it’s good news that the gray wolf population is recovering, it’s essential to ensure that efforts are made to protect them from threats. Ranchers and environmentalists must work together to find ways to promote coexistence, such as setting up wolf-free zones or introducing non-lethal measures like guard dogs or electric fences. In conclusion, while the official declaration of the gray wolf population being fully restored is a significant milestone, it's equally important to note the potential consequences of removing the protections that come with being listed as an endangered species. It's time to take every possible measure to ensure these majestic creatures are not pushed back into the endangered species list."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: What is the oldest continuous Olympic team sport?

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others.

The fact that this movie doesn't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters, and this in turn keeps you watching to the end. Fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  Taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu films; the action is limited to (albeit impressive) kicking and the occasional punch.

To make a stone pickaxe, you'll need three pieces of cobblestone and two sticks. Simply arrange them in the shape of a T and you'll have a pickaxe. However, as you gather more resources, you'll want to upgrade to stronger pickaxes. The next upgrade is the iron pickaxe. To make an iron pickaxe, you'll need three iron ingots and two sticks. Again, arrange them in a T shape and you'll have a much stronger pickaxe. But what about gold pickaxes? While they might seem like a luxurious option, gold pickaxes aren't actually very useful. They don't last very long and are only slightly better than stone pickaxes. It's better to save your gold for other uses. Finally, the ultimate pickaxe is the diamond pickaxe. To craft one, you'll need three diamonds and two sticks. Diamond pickaxes are incredibly durable and can mine through even the toughest blocks. They're especially useful for mining obsidian, which can only be mined with a diamond pickaxe. In conclusion, upgrading your pickaxe is important for efficient mining in Minecraft. Starting with a stone pickaxe and working your way up to a diamond pickaxe will help you collect resources faster and more effectively. Just remember, gold pickaxes might look fancy, but they're not worth the investment."},{"instruction":"The center of the Galápagos Islands is located in the Pacific Ocean at the intersection of the 90th meridian west and the Equator very close to the Western Hemisphere .

When it comes to personal care, you may be focusing on the basics such as brushing your teeth and taking a shower. However, there are a few minor details that you might be overlooking. Here are seven simple tips to enhance your personal care routine: 1. Slip off tight jewellery: Tight jewelry not only affects blood circulation but can also cause skin irritation. Be sure to remove any tight jewelry before hitting the bed to avoid any unnecessary discomfort. 2. Take off your makeup: Sleeping with makeup can clog pores and make your skin look dull. Make it a habit to take off your makeup before bed to avoid any breakouts. 3. Shave your legs: Regular shaving can prevent ingrown hairs and give you smooth legs. Make sure to use shaving cream and always shave in the direction of hair growth. 4. Protect your hairline from hair dye: Dyeing your hair can be a great way to mix up your look, but it's crucial to protect your hairline from dye stains. Apply petroleum jelly along your hairline before dyeing to create a barrier between your scalp and dye. 5. Remove sticky adhesives: Glue and sticker residue can be tough to remove from the skin. To remove any sticky residue, use an oil-based solution such as coconut or olive oil. 6. Soften your cuticles: Cuticles can be rough and dry, causing discomfort around your nails. Massage a cuticle oil or coconut oil onto your cuticles to soften and moisturize them. 7. Tame static-ridden hair: Static hair can be frustrating and take away from your overall look.

A coroner's inquest into his death concluded it was likely that someone had killed him. But Scotland Yard said it was most likely no one else was involved in Williams' death. Confined spaces expert Peter Faulding believes Williams was murdered in a 'perfect crime","output":"The Mysterious Death of MI6 Codebreaker Gareth Williams In August 2010, the body of MI6 codebreaker Gareth Williams was found locked inside a bag in his apartment. His death immediately sparked a frenzy of speculation about whether he had been murdered or had died accidentally. A coroner's inquest into Williams' death concluded that it was likely that someone had killed him. There were no signs of struggle or forced entry in his apartment, leading the coroner to believe that Williams had been the victim of a criminal act. However, the Metropolitan Police disagreed with the coroner's conclusion. They maintained that it was most likely that no one else was involved in Williams' death. The police pointed out that Williams had been known to practice self-bondage, and suggested that he may have accidentally died while attempting a risky sexual game. Despite the police's assertions, some experts remain convinced that Williams was murdered. Among them is Peter Faulding, a confined spaces expert who believes that Williams was the victim of a \\"perfect crime.\\" Faulding believes that Williams was restrained and suffocated, then placed inside the bag. The bag was then locked from the outside, using an intricate locking mechanism that would have been difficult for Williams to operate by himself. The fact that Williams' body was discovered inside a bag reinforces the theory that he was murdered. It's hard to imagine that he would have locked himself inside the bag, particularly given the complexity of the locking mechanism. One of the most intriguing aspects of Williams' death is the fact that no one has been charged with his murder. Despite extensive investigations by the police, no suspects have been identified and no arrests have been made. The mystery surrounding Williams' death continues to fascinate the public and experts alike. While some believe that the truth may never be revealed, others remain hopeful that one day the killer will be caught and brought to justice."},{"instruction":"Tweet: @sam_h786 as ur coming on to here im just off to bed hows ur day been? x Predict the sentiment of this tweet.
