A Logo Throwback: Returning to the “S4C~” Era In addition to the introduction of the captivating mascot, S4C’s rebranding will reintroduce their previous logo, the “S4C~” mark prominently used during the Dragon ident era. This move pays homage to a successful period in the channel’s history, evoking feelings of nostalgia among long-time viewers while simultaneously demonstrating the broadcaster’s dedication to serving its audience in new and exciting ways. An Inclusive Identity S4C’s rebranding serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusivity in media and broadcasting.

After careful consideration and planning, the channel announced that changes were in the works, and now, on October 12th, the long-awaited rebranding has finally been unveiled. The previous set of idents, which had temporarily replaced the regular branding during the Christmas season, were withdrawn as planned. These idents featured TV sets stacked together to form a Christmas tree, creating a festive ambiance. However, it was clear that this temporary design was only a stepping stone towards something more remarkable and captivating. From January to October of this year, viewers were treated to flickering random images within idents that showcased TV sets placed in various rooms. While these idents offered a sense of intrigue, they were always intended to be temporary placeholders until the upcoming rebranding. S4C took a strategic approach and enlisted the expert services of Ezhik Media, the creative production team behind the earlier temporary idents, to breathe life into the new rebranding campaign. Ezhik Media not only facilitated the transition from the old idents to the new ones, but they also ensured a seamless integration of the exciting changes. To introduce the newly unveiled mascot to viewers, S4C broadcasted a short film at midnight on October 12th. This film served as a captivating glimpse into the character’s story, providing a unique introduction to the shape-shifting black blob of slime. This innovative approach further highlighted S4C’s commitment to engaging and surprising its audience.

Diolch yn fawr iawn, [Your Name] CEO - S4C Tvfan22: It looks like S4C have rebranded again, Gone are the flickering TVs from earlier this year, Now the new theme is goo/slime/shape-shifting, And for some reason the 1995 logo is back, even though it feels out of place since there aren’t any dragons, The idents themselves are awesome and I love the blob character morphing into different shapes, They teased the whole “shape-shifting” aspect last year at Christmas with the TV sets, But they always “rested” the Everyday Extraordinary theme over Christmas, so I read nothing into it, even if I did think “an old VCR, a empty school hall, what’s that all about?”. Write a forum conversation talking about the new look and how they barely saw it coming, with the Christmas look and fake rebrand TVnerd1984: So, did anyone catch the launch of S4C’s new look? I honestly didn’t see it coming with the whole slime/shape-shifting theme. The gooey blob mascot is definitely a twist. Thoughts? CymruAmByth99: Yeah, the new idents caught me off guard as well. The Christmas idents last year with the stacked TVs made me think they might be going for a retro angle or something nostalgic. But nope, we’ve got a shape-shifting blob instead. DragonHeartWelsh: I’m actually quite fond of the new mascot. It’s different, that’s for sure. I remember thinking the Christmas idents with the old VCR and the school hall were a bit random, but didn’t really connect the dots that it was hinting at a rebrand. AderynCoch: Anyone else thrown by the 1995 logo comeback? I don’t dislike it per se, it’s just… without the dragons, the nostalgic vibe feels half-baked. Mixed signals, if you ask me. SionedSoapFan: The blob mascot is growing on me, not gonna lie. It’s so expressive and fun – unlike anything I’ve seen on other channels. A bold choice! But I do miss the dragons, they had a certain magic about them. WelshTellyAddict: I’m in two minds about ditching the dragons. On one hand, you’ve got this cute, modern mascot that’s all about change and innovation. On the other, the dragons were a big part of S4C’s identity. It’s a bittersweet change. TVnerd1984: I have to give props to the creative team. The ident where the mascot morphs into a chair and then a bicycle? Pure genius. It shows off their range and the blob’s, erm, fluidity in a really memorable way. TVCollector67: True, the idents do stand out. But do you know what gets me? The continuity of it all. The Christmas teaser, the temporary idents with their flickering images, it’s all coming together. Although I admit, I didn’t piece it together until the blob showed up! PobolYWe: Absolutely loving the new look. I think it’s fresh, and the blob has a charm to it. Gotta applaud S4C for taking risks and trying to stand out in today’s crowded TV landscape. CymruAmByth99: It’s all about evolution, isn’t it? Broadcasters have to keep shaking things up to stay relevant. I’m curious to see how they integrate the blob into other aspects of the channel, like promotions and online content. DragonHeartWelsh: Here’s hoping the blob becomes a beloved icon. I mean, remember how the dragons were met with mixed reactions at first? Now they’re dearly missed. I reckon the blob might just have the same fate, given some time. SionedSoapFan: Fingers crossed! It’s all about giving these changes a chance. Kudos to S4C for not just being bold, but also for wrapping it in such a slick, visually appealing package. Definitely makes channel surfing more interesting! TVnerd1984: Couldn’t agree more. I’m excited to see where they take this new direction. The channel switching between the blob and the retro logo is a bit jarring, but nonetheless, I’m curious to see how it’ll evolve. Can’t wait for the next surprise they have up their sleeve! Write a follow up at Christmas, where the Christmas ident is unveiled TVnerd1984: Hey gang, did you catch S4C’s new Christmas ident last night? They’ve done it again – festive, fun, and in full blob glory! CymruAmByth99: I saw it! The blob turned into a snowman, right? And then it morphed into a Christmas tree. Absolutely brilliant! It kept the essence of the new branding while getting us into the holiday spirit. DragonHeartWelsh: Loved the snowflake transitions too. It goes to show that the blob isn’t just a one-trick pony – it can go full-on festive. Who knew sludgy goo could be so Christmassy? AderynCoch: It’s amazing how they’ve managed to keep the identity consistent even with the Christmas theme. Did anyone else notice the subtle nods to Welsh Christmas traditions in the background? The touch of cultural identity is a nice blend with the mascot’s playfulness. SionedSoapFan: Yes, @AderynCoch, the Plygain carols in the background had me nostalgic and teary-eyed. They really went all out to infuse Welsh culture into the ident. The blob is slowly but surely becoming a part of the S4C family. WelshTellyAddict: What’s clever is how they’ve transitioned from the shape-shifting theme into something seasonal without it feeling forced. The charm of that blob… I think it’ll win over anyone who’s still on the fence about the new rebrand. TVnerd1984: Agreed, @WelshTellyAddict! It’s like they’re telling us that the blob can be anything – even Santa’s little helper! Did you notice the subtle sparkle when it shifted? Production values through the roof! TVCollector67: Aye, the production quality is top-notch. The snow-covered scenery, the twinkling lights, that cozy Welsh winter vibe – it’s all captured so beautifully. Also, excellent work on the sound design, making those transitions feel magical. PobolYWe: I’m just here waiting for the blob to have its own line of Christmas merchandise. Imagine the plushies! Take my money, S4C, take it all! DragonHeartWelsh: Merchandise would be a fantastic idea. Consider the collectibles! I’d love to see the blob in its Christmas form on my shelf. And in response to the scenery, it showcases the beauty of Wales in winter perfectly. SionedSoapFan: They should definitely consider an animated Christmas special starring the blob. There’s so much potential for storytelling, and I can see it becoming a heartwarming yearly tradition. TVnerd1984: That would be epic, @SionedSoapFan! Imagine the blob bringing different Christmas tales from across Wales to life. S4C, if you’re reading this, we’ve got some ideas for you! CymruAmByth99: As the blob brings us all together for the holidays, I must say – I’m looking forward to what S4C has in store for us next. More surprises, I hope! Happy holidays, everyone! DragonHeartWelsh: Happy holidays, indeed! Brought to us by a blob of Christmas cheer. Who would’ve ever thought? Write a follow up where they say it is far better than last year’s Christmas ident TVnerd1984: Hey everyone! So, about S4C’s Christmas ident this year—I think it totally outdid last year’s. The whole blob-snowman and tree transition was just a masterpiece. The details! It feels more connected to the festivities, you know? CymruAmByth99: Agreed! Last year’s Christmas ident was nice, with the whole stacked TVs forming a tree, but this year they’ve raised the bar. It’s like the blob has brought a new energy to the channel. DragonHeartWelsh: Totally better! Last year’s ident was more of a filler, it felt a bit cold, didn’t it? This year’s is warmer, more engaging, and creatively far superior. Plus, the blob integrating into classic Christmas symbols was just genius. AderynCoch: Spot on, guys. Last year I was all about nostalgia with the old TV sets, but this year’s blob just brings so much charm and character. The way it blended into the wintry scenes, it felt magical. SionedSoapFan: It’s not just the visuals, either. The music this year was a step up! Did you notice? It’s like they’ve completely embraced the new branding and are running with it. The blob really captures the essence of the holidays now. WelshTellyAddict: Last year I missed the dragons, not gonna lie. But this year’s ident made me a convert to the blob. It’s fun to see how it’s going to morph next, and it gets you into the Christmas spirit instantly. TVnerd1984: It’s all about progression, folks. And this blob is becoming a staple. Can’t believe I’m saying this, but… I’m excited to see what they’d do for Easter and summer!ikelab.xyz TVCollector67: You’ve got a point, @TVnerd1984. This blob’s got range! Last year’s ident was cool in a ‘let’s-play-it-safe’ manner, but this year, they went all out, and I’m here for it. Hats off to S4C for being bold. PobolYWe: Let’s be real, the blob is just perfect for merchandising, which last year’s theme wasn’t. Imagine the blob with a tiny Santa hat! I’ll take ten. And yes, I’m already looking forward to how they’ll deck it out for other holidays. DragonHeartWelsh: We should start a petition for blob merch! But seriously, it’s the little details for me. The glint in the snow, the cozy Welsh scenes in the background, they’ve crafted an entire mood this year. SionedSoapFan: Yes to blob merch! And yes, @DragonHeartWelsh, the mood! It’s like S4C has found the sweet spot for their branding with this shapeshifting mascot. The Christmas ident this year is a testament to that. TVnerd1984: Think we can all agree the blob is winning hearts and spreading festive vibes much better this year. The creativity is next level! It just shows how much a bold rebrand can pay off. CymruAmByth99: Here’s to more blob and more festive creativity! S4C nailed it this year. Happy Holidays, fellow TV buffs! Write a forum convo where a user wonders what happened to the abstract multicolored chasing lines animation shown before the start of programmes (introduced with the 2009 logo) as he usually wakes up at 9am, and he wonders what happened to it after October 12 as he doesn’t wake up at 5:58am RetroTVFan88: Hey everyone, quick question for the early birds in here. Does anyone remember the abstract multicolored chasing lines animation that S4C used to run before the start of programs? It used to air with the 2009 logo transition, usually brightened my morning routine. I’ve been following S4C’s schedule pretty closely, but ever since October 12, I seem to have missed it. Granted, I haven’t been up at 5:58 am to catch the very start of the broadcast day. Did they retire it with the latest rebrand, or am I just not up early enough? MorningGlory21: Oh, I remember those well, @RetroTVFan88. Used to give the channel a bit of an energetic start to the day, didn’t it? However, since the rebrand on October 12, I believe S4C has indeed retired that animation. The morning slots and start of broadcast animations have been updated to fit the new visual identity, revolving around the shapeshifting blob mascot and the reintroduced “S4C~” logo from the Dragon ident era. Quite a change from the abstract lines! TechSavvyWatcher: That’s right, @MorningGlory21. The old animations like the multicolored chasing lines were phased out as part of the rebranding. Everything from the idents to the start-of-day animations now features the new blob mascot in some way. It’s all about consistency in the branding now. Not to say the new stuff isn’t interesting, but it definitely marks the end of an era for those abstract animations. NostalgiaNerd92: I’m actually going to miss those. There was something mesmerizing about those colorful lines, a nice bit of abstract art before diving into the day’s programming. The blob is fun, but those animations had a different vibe. Guess it’s all part of moving forward and keeping things fresh. EarlyBirdViewr: Yeah, those were part of the channel’s charm for me too. But honestly, having caught the new stuff, it’s engaging in a whole different way. The blob has its own appeal, surprisingly versatile and manages to give the channel a modern touch. Still, for those of us who remember the lines, it’ll be a missed signature. RetroTVFan88: Appreciate the insights, everyone! Seems I was holding onto a bygone part of S4C without realizing. Time to adjust my alarm clock and give the new animations a chance, I suppose. Everything evolves, and it’s only fair to give the blob its due. Still, a part of me will always have a soft spot for those multicolored chasing lines and the simplicity they brought to the screen. PixelArtLover: If there’s one thing I’ve learned from watching TV channels evolve, it’s that changes like these can be polarizing but often grow on you over time. Who knows, maybe in a few years we’ll be reminiscing about the early days of the blob in the same way we are now about those abstract lines. Change is the only constant, after all. Write that a off air loop is now used at night, DigitalDawnChaser: Has anyone else noticed that S4C has started using an off air loop at night now? Gone are the days of the static screen or color bars that many channels tend to revert to during the wee hours. Instead, they’ve rolled out a visually appealing loop that runs through the night until the broadcast day starts again. TechTellyFan: Yes, I saw that! It’s a refreshing change. The loop includes a series of subtly animated scenes featuring their now-iconic blob mascot in various tranquil nighttime settings, accompanied by a soothing soundtrack. It’s quite a clever way to maintain engagement, even when they’re technically “off air.” Plus, it feels very on-brand with their recent rebranding efforts. NightOwlWatcher: Absolutely love the new off air loop. It’s so calming, almost like it’s designed to keep you company rather than remind you there’s nothing to watch. I stumbled upon it by accident, and it’s quite mesmerizing. The gentle animations with the blob gazing at the stars or sitting by a softly glowing campfire really set a peaceful mood. RetroScreenLover: As much as I enjoy the innovation and the aesthetic touch of the new off air loop, part of me misses the nostalgia of the old-school color bars and the test card. There was something unmistakably “broadcast” about tuning in to those. But, I must admit, S4C’s approach is a sign of the times, embracing continuous visual engagement over the traditional static screens. LoopLurker: I’m curious if they’ll introduce variations of this loop depending on the season or upcoming events. Given how they’ve embraced the blob mascot fully, it wouldn’t surprise me to see winter-themed loops or special editions leading up to major holidays. It’s a subtle yet effective way to keep the audience connected to the channel’s identity, even in off hours. PixelPeacekeeper: It’s an interesting development for sure. Moving to an off air loop that retains viewer interest (even if subconsciously) through aesthetically pleasing visuals and music is a smart move in today’s 24/7 content cycle. It also potentially serves as a gentle reminder of the channel’s brand identity, keeping S4C in the minds of viewers even when they’re not actively broadcasting new content. DigitalDawnChaser: @PixelPeacekeeper, well said. It’s all about brand connection in this era, and S4C’s off air loop is a testament to that. It’s compelling how a channel can extend its reach and impact, transcending traditional broadcast constraints with creative touches like this. I’m excited to see how this develops further and what other innovations they might roll out next. Write the caption used during the loop, (along with the logo below) “Join us in a moment of serene reflection as we journey through the night. We’ll return with more of your favorite programming soon. [S4C Logo] Nos da, and sweet dreams.” Write a bit more about the blob’s appearance, The mesmerizing blob mascot that S4C has embraced as part of its rebranding is not just any ordinary character; it’s an embodiment of fluidity, creativity, and adaptability. This captivating mascot is a female shape-shifting black blob of slime, offering a unique visual representation that stands out in the broadcasting landscape. # Appearance Details Color and Texture: The blob is primarily a glossy, deep black, resembling the richness of space or the depth of the ocean at night. Its surface catches the light in a way that adds a fascinating layer of visual interest, making it appear almost cosmic in nature. The texture is smooth, almost liquid-like, giving the impression that the blob can effortlessly shift into any shape or form it desires. Shape-shifting Essence: One of the most notable aspects of the blob’s appearance is its ability to morph. It can seamlessly transition from one form to another, embodying various objects, characters, or even abstract concepts. This shape-shifting nature symbolizes S4C’s diverse range of programming, from drama to comedy, and children’s shows to documentaries. Each transformation is done with a fluid elegance that captivates the viewer’s imagination. Eyes: Perhaps the most engaging feature of the blob is its eyes. When taking on a more anthropomorphic form, the blob sports two large, expressive eyes. These eyes are more than just visual elements; they serve as windows to the blob’s ‘soul,’ conveying emotions and reactions that add depth to its character. The eyes sparkle with curiosity, humor, and intelligence, drawing viewers into an emotional connection with the mascot. Interactions with Environments: In various idents and promotional materials, the blob is seen interacting with its surroundings in creative and whimsical ways. Whether it’s morphing into items that correspond with the programming or engaging in playful antics, the blob always seems perfectly in sync with the world around it. This ability to blend and adapt further enhances its appeal, demonstrating an incredible range of versatility. # Symbolism and Impact The blob’s appearance goes beyond mere aesthetics; it serves as a metaphor for S4C’s commitment to innovation and flexibility in its content offering. It’s a visual storyteller, capable of encapsulating the essence of the channel’s spirit without uttering a single word. Through its dynamic shifts and expressive features, the blob invites viewers on a journey, making the channel’s branding both memorable and engaging. In a media landscape where standing out is key, this shape-shifting blob manages to capture the imagination of audiences, young and old alike. Its appearance effectively communicates the idea that S4C is a channel where boundaries are fluid, creativity is limitless, and surprises await at every turn. Write a tweet saying a user loves it when her eyes are happy “Absolutely in love with @S4C’s blob mascot, especially when her eyes light up with happiness! There’s something so pure and joyful about it. 💖 #S4Cblob #HappyEyes” Write a tweet saying it certainly beats the TV set package in use for 10 months and the “Modern Life/Magnetic mishmash of idents before that” “Without a doubt, @S4C’s shape-shifting blob mascot outshines the TV set package we had for 10 months and the “Modern Life/Magnetic” mishmash of idents before that. It’s fresh, innovative, and engaging! 🌟 #S4CRebrand #CreativeIdentity” Write a case study from Ezhik Media, saying that the rebranding was initiated because “S4C’s branding seemed to be losing its sanity, using a mix of idents made by Proud Creative in 2009 and idents made by them in 2017” # Case Study: Rebranding S4C - A Journey to Coherence and Innovation Client: S4C (Sianel Pedwar Cymru - Channel Four Wales) Agency: Ezhik Media Challenge: S4C, a cornerstone of Welsh-language broadcasting, found itself at a crossroads of identity, blending disparate elements of branding that spanned over a decade. The channel’s visual identity had become a collage of the past and present, mixing idents created by Proud Creative in 2009 and various elements introduced by Ezhik Media in 2017. This eclectic assortment, although rich in history, led to a sense of fragmentation, with the branding gradually losing its cohesiveness and, importantly, its sanity. The channel was in dire need of a unified visual language that would not only pay homage to its heritage but also propel it into the future with a fresh, identifiable, and innovative identity. Objective: The primary goal was to rejuvenate S4C’s branding, crafting an identity that would resonate on both a national and international stage. The rebranding needed to reflect the channel’s dynamism, versatility, and Welsh cultural roots while appealing to a broad and diverse audience. A significant aspect of this objective was to introduce an engaging and distinctive mascot that could become the face of S4C, embodying its values and captivating viewers across all demographics. Solution: After extensive research, creative sessions, and audience analysis, Ezhik Media proposed a radical yet deeply symbolic new mascot for S4C: a shape-shifting black blob of slime. This female mascot, characterized by her ability to morph into an endless variety of shapes, perfectly symbolized the diversity and adaptability of S4C’s programming. Her dynamic nature made her an ideal ambassador for the brand, capable of engaging viewers in novel and memorable ways. The rebranding strategy involved a comprehensive overhaul of S4C’s visual identity. The “S4C~” logo, reminiscent of the Dragon ident era, was reintroduced, blending heritage with modernity. The new idents, featuring the blob mascot in a series of imaginative transformations, brought to life the essence of S4C’s programming—from drama to documentary, comedy, and children’s shows. Implementation: Ezhik Media orchestrated the transition to the new branding with meticulous care. Every element was designed to ensure consistency and flexibility across multiple platforms and media types. The rollout of the new idents, alongside the reintroduction of the “S4C~” logo, was synchronized to capture the audience’s attention and mark the beginning of a new era for S4C. Results: The rebranding initiative was a resounding success. From its launch, the new mascot captivated the channel’s audience, generating a wave of positive feedback and engagement. The cohesive visual identity resonated with viewers, offering a sense of familiarity infused with fresh, innovative energy. The channel saw a noticeable increase in viewer engagement and brand recognition, indicating a strong connection with the new branding. The reintroduction of the “S4C~” logo, paired with the groundbreaking mascot, played a pivotal role in S4C’s revitalized brand identity. The rebranding not only signaled a return to the channel’s roots but also a bold step forward into a dynamic and inclusive future. Conclusion: Ezhik Media’s rebranding of S4C addressed the critical need for coherence, innovation, and engagement in its visual identity. By moving away from the disjointed mix of past idents and embracing a singular, adaptable mascot, S4C successfully rejuvenated its brand. This transformation highlighted the importance of adaptability and cohesion in a media landscape that is constantly evolving. The rebranding of S4C by Ezhik Media stands as a testament to the power of creative vision in redefining a brand’s identity and forging a deep connection with its audience. Write a forum convo in May 2024 where S4C Analog is switched off, replaced with a caption asking us to switch and thanking us for watching, and our friend is keeping analog viewers company Thread Title: End of an Era - S4C Analog Switch-off May 2024 VintageTellyLover: Well, folks, it finally happened. Today was the day S4C said goodbye to its analog signal. Did anyone else catch the final moments before the switch-off? They had a simple caption thanking viewers for their loyalty and asking us to switch to digital platforms. It’s truly the end of an era. 😢 DigitalDawn: Saw it! It felt quite somber yet historical. That caption was a respectful nod to all the analog loyalists out there. Time to embrace the future fully, I guess. Anyone got a screenshot of the caption for keepsake? CymruCathodeRay: Yes, I managed to capture that moment. There’s something poignant about those final seconds. It’s like watching a piece of your childhood being archived into history. But, gotta admit, the transition to digital has been smooth and offers so much more in terms of quality and choice. AnalogAndy: It’s hard to let go, isn’t it? I’ve been keeping company with the analog viewers all day, flipping through the old channels, reminiscing the static-filled days. That caption, though simple, felt like a gentle pat on the back — a final goodbye from an old friend. 😟 TechieTaran: Can’t help but feel nostalgic, but also excited about what this means for broadcasting tech. Analog had its charm, sure, but the capabilities of digital and streaming are just phenomenal. S4C’s digital presence has been impressive; their online content and digital quality have really set a new standard. HistoricHeddiw: It’s a significant moment for broadcasting history in Wales, no doubt. Analog switch-offs mark a definitive shift in how media is consumed, and it’s fascinating to witness. That caption was a classy touch by S4C. We’ve come a long way from the flickering screens to crystal clear digital broadcasts. PreservationPete: Did anyone think to record the last few analog broadcasts for posterity? It’d be great to have a historical archive of these moments. Also, as much as I’m warming up to the endless options of digital, there’s something irreplaceable about the simplicity and nostalgia of the analog era. FutureFfion: Saw the switch-off and couldn’t help but feel a mix of sadness and anticipation. The caption asking us to switch felt like S4C holding our hand through the change. I’m curious about the new possibilities and how S4C will continue to innovate on digital platforms. Here’s to embracing the future while cherishing the past! NostalgicNia: Exactly, @FutureFfion. It’s like closing a book you’ve loved and opening a new, exciting one. I’m sentimental about the analog days but looking ahead with optimism. S4C’s transition and how they’ve handled it really show their commitment to viewers of all generations. Let’s see where this new digital journey takes us! RetroRhodri: Cheers to that, everyone. While I’m sad to see analog go, the new digital era promises so much more in terms of interactivity, quality, and accessibility. S4C’s farewell caption was a dignified conclusion to decades of analog broadcasting. Here’s to new beginnings and keeping the spirit of Welsh broadcasting alive and vibrant! 📺✨ Write a convo where a user describes the message, also the blob was included in the image, also the logo at the bottom right as usual Thread Title: The Final Analog Sign-Off of S4C - A Touching Farewell BlobFanGareth: Did anyone catch the final analog sign-off message from S4C? It wasn’t just a plain message. They included the blob mascot in the image, which was a nice touch, making the farewell feel personal. The S4C logo was there at the bottom right, as usual, maintaining that brand consistency one last time on the analog waves. AnalogAled: Yes, I saw it! It was a bit emotional, honestly. The inclusion of the blob somehow made it more poignant. It felt like a gentle reminder of the journey from the past to the present, with the blob transitioning us into the digital era. TechTransitionTara: Exactly, @AnalogAled! The blob has become such a significant part of S4C’s identity, and having it there felt like a bridge between the two worlds. It’s interesting how characters or mascots can humanize technology and change. That final image was almost symbolic, representing both an end and a new beginning. LogoLlew: The logo placement was just perfect, wasn’t it? Right there in its familiar spot, giving us that continuity amidst change. It made me think about all the times I’ve glanced at that corner of the screen over the years. The consistency of branding, even in a farewell message, speaks volumes about S4C’s attention to detail. DigitalDwynwen: Capturing that moment felt important, like holding onto a piece of history. The blob in the farewell image felt like she was guiding us, reassuring us that while the medium changes, the essence and the spirit of S4C remain the same. It was a comforting signal, almost saying, “Come along, there’s more to see and explore.” NostalgiaNerys: That’s beautifully put, @DigitalDwynwen. I’ve always felt a connection with the blob since its introduction. It’s quirky, dynamic, and somehow, amidst the pixels, it carries the heart of S4C. Seeing it in the final analog sign-off was both a clever and touching choice. It somehow made the transition easier, knowing our beloved blob is coming along for the ride. PreservationPrys: Did anyone manage to record it? I’d love to keep it as part of a media evolution collection. The blob has marked a significant period in S4C’s branding, and having it featured in this historical transition is quite special. Plus, it’s a testament to how far we’ve come in broadcasting technology. FutureFioled: Watching that sign-off, blob included, was a moment I didn’t expect to be so moved by. It’s funny how technology and even branding elements, like logos and mascots, weave their way into our lives. Cheers to S4C for handling the farewell with such grace and character. Excited to see where the digital frontier takes us, with the blob leading the way! RetroRhiannon: It was a fitting tribute and a gentle nudge into the future. I’ve always appreciated how S4C has embraced change without losing sight of its roots. That message, with the blob and the logo, captured the essence of what makes S4C unique—its ability to evolve while honoring its past. Here’s to digital adventures and the blob’s escapades in this new era! Write a convo about a ident used for news and serious programmes, its more sedative and calm Thread Title: S4C’s New Ident for News and Serious Programmes - A Sober Shift NewsWatcherCadfan: Has anyone else noticed the new ident S4C is using for news and serious programmes? It’s a lot more sedative and calm compared to their other idents. Seems like they’ve taken a deliberate approach to match the tone of the content. Thoughts? SeriousSubjectSeren: Yes, I’ve seen it! It’s quite a shift from the dynamic and playful blob mascot animations we’re used to. I think it’s a smart move. It sets the right tone for the viewers, preparing them for the seriousness of the content. Reflective and respectful without losing the S4C identity. CalmCeri: I appreciate the subtlety in the transition. It’s like the blob becomes more tranquil and composed, morphing into shapes that suggest a sense of gravity and introspection. No playful antics or bright colors, just soothing movements and a contemplative vibe. Fits the news and serious programme segments perfectly. VisualVern: Totally agree, @CalmCeri. The use of cooler colors and slower transitions definitely brings a sense of calmness and sobriety, which is ideal before diving into the news or programmes dealing with serious topics. It’s thoughtful branding that considers the viewer’s emotional readiness for what’s next. AudienceAnalystAlun: It’s an excellent example of visual storytelling and audience preparation. S4C seems to be very aware of the impact of visuals on viewer perception and mood. This approach of using a more sedative and calm ident for news and serious programmes respects the content’s nature and the audience’s expectations. ToneTudur: The contrast between this and their more upbeat idents is stark but necessary. News and serious subjects demand a different mindset from viewers, and this gentle, more subdued ident eases one into the right frame of mind. It’s subtle but effective visual communication. EmpathicElin: Has anyone noticed if the blob’s eyes change expression in these idents? I feel like even its eyes carry a more solemn and reflective look, further driving home the content’s seriousness. It’s a small detail, but it adds so much depth to how the ident resonates emotionally. DesignDafydd: @EmpathicElin, you’re spot on. The attention to detail is remarkable. Even the blob’s eyes adjust to convey a demeanor that’s contemplative and serious. It’s these nuanced changes that showcase S4C’s commitment to thoughtful design and audience engagement across varying content tones. ReflectiveRhian: It’s refreshing to see such a tailored approach to idents, especially in an era where stations often go for one-size-fits-all solutions. S4C’s dedication to crafting an experience that adjusts to the content’s mood is commendable. It respects the content’s gravity and the audience’s intelligence. NewsConnoisseurCai: Agreed with all points here. S4C’s approach to using visual cues to prep the audience for serious content without jarring their experience shows a level of sensitivity and sophistication in their branding. A well-considered strategy that other broadcasters could learn from. Cheers to S4C for their thoughtful execution! Write a forum convo when the channel breaks down, a playful technical difficulties caption is put on air, saying “Wps!, Mae gennym broblem” Thread Title: S4C’s Playful Technical Difficulties Caption - “Wps!, Mae gennym broblem” TechTroubleTomos: Did anyone catch S4C’s screensaver earlier when the channel went down? Instead of the usual dull “We’re experiencing technical difficulties” message, they had a caption that read “Wps!, Mae gennym broblem” with an animation of the blob looking bewildered. Gave me a good chuckle during the wait. 😂 ErrorEncounterEfa: Saw that! Leave it to S4C to keep things light even when there’s a hiccup. The blob’s puzzled expression was priceless. It’s refreshing to see a bit of humor used in these situations. Made the technical glitch feel less annoying for sure. DigitalDewi: Absolutely, @ErrorEncounterEfa. It actively made me less irritated about the interruption. Did anyone manage to snap a picture? I was too busy laughing and forgot to capture it. It’s these little details that really make you appreciate S4C’s approach to broadcasting. HumourHuw: Missed it, but this sounds hilarious! Most channels could take a note from S4C’s book on this. Using the blob mascot in such a creative way even during technical difficulties showcases their unique charm. Does the blob have a name yet, by the way? GlitchGwen: Not sure if the blob has an official name, @HumourHuw, but I vote for “Blobin Gobithiol” as a fun title. 😄 And yes, the technical difficulties screen was a breath of fresh air. Shows that they don’t take themselves too seriously and care about the viewer’s experience, even in less-than-ideal situations. TechTalkTegwen: It’s a smart move from a viewer experience perspective. Encountering a technical glitch can be frustrating for the audience, but S4C’s playful approach likely helped mitigate any annoyance. Plus, it’s on-brand with their innovative and viewer-friendly style. ErrorExpertEirian: Has anyone else noticed this trend with S4C making the most out of unforeseen interruptions? Last year’s Christmas lights tangling was another classic. It’s like they have a whole playbook for delightful ways to handle technical difficulties! SupportSioned: I love the continuity in using the blob across various broadcasting elements, from idents to technical difficulties. It’s turning the mascot into a comforting presence, no matter the context. Also, “Wps!, Mae gennym broblem” might be my new favorite phrase for minor mishaps in daily life. TechyTanwen: Kudos to the team behind these ideas. Turning a potential viewer frustration into an amusing interlude is no small feat. It definitely builds a stronger bond with the audience. Plus, it’s always a good day when you get to see the blob, even under less desirable circumstances. GlitchGoodbyeGuto: Agreed, @TechyTanwen. It’s about making the best out of every situation. If anything, this incident has just added another layer to my fondness for S4C’s creative team. Can’t wait to see how they surprise us next, hopefully under better circumstances though! 😄 Write a convo while off air there is a filler animation of her as a puddle, sleeping","output":"Thread Title: S4C's Off-Air Blob Puddle Animation - A Tranquil Filler MidnightWatcherWyn: Did anyone catch the filler animation S4C aired during their off-air hours last night? It was the blob, but unlike its usual lively self, it transformed into a peaceful puddle, seemingly sleeping. It was oddly calming and a nice touch for late-night viewers. NightOwlNia: Yes, I saw that too! There’s something very soothing about seeing the blob in such a serene state. Makes the dead hours of television feel a bit more special and thoughtful. The animation had this gentle breathing motion that was surprisingly hypnotic. PeacefulPrys: It’s fascinating how they've managed to give the blob character even in its most minimalist form. The idea of it sleeping as a puddle, and the subtle breathing animation, give it such a peaceful presence. Makes staying up late or waking up in the wee hours a bit more comforting. InsomniacIolo: Absolutely, @PeacefulPrys! It's a clever way to use the off-air time to reinforce the blob's versatility and endearing qualities. Plus, it adds a layer of continuity to the channel's branding, even when there's technically nothing being broadcasted. TranquilTudur: I found it unexpectedly reassuring. In those moments of insomnia, when the world feels a bit too quiet, seeing that little sleeping blob puddle gave me a sense of companionship. S4C’s creative use of the mascot during all hours is truly innovative. SoothingSian: The term \\"tranquil\\" describes it perfectly. It’s as if the blob is keeping viewers company through the night, offering a silent form of solidarity. It'd be interesting to know if S4C plans to introduce more variations of these calming animations for their off-air times. LullabyLlinos: Agreed, @SoothingSian. I'd love a collection of these filler animations - each one depicting the blob in different calming states. It could be a lovely way to explore the concept of rest through the eyes of such a dynamic character like the blob. DreamwatcherDylan: I'm curious if there's a storytelling aspect they might build on with these animations. Perhaps showing the blob engaging in various nocturnal adventures, with the sleeping puddle being just the starting point of its dream journey? RestfulRhodri: That’s a brilliant idea, @DreamwatcherDylan. It’s a way to weave a silent narrative through visuals alone, inviting viewers to create their own stories. The blob has proven to be a versatile mascot, capable of conveying a wide range of emotions and stories without a single word. SnoozeSeren: Here’s hoping S4C considers keeping these tranquil, off-air moments as a regular feature. It’s a unique approach to overnight broadcasting that humanizes the channel, making it feel like more than just a service but a nighttime companion. MidnightWatcherWyn: Well said, everyone. There’s something deeply touching about the thought of the blob, this emblem of dynamism and creativity, taking a rest alongside its viewers. It’s a small but powerful reminder that we all need a moment to pause and recharge. Let’s see if S4C has more of these relaxing surprises in store for us."},{"instruction":"Write a convo asking if they still have text on screen about when the channel comes back on, along with a Viewers Helpline number (as seen in older off air fillers)","output":"Thread Title: Does S4C Still Display Next Broadcast Time and Viewers Helpline in Off-Air Fillers? ClassicTVChris: Hey everyone, quick question about S4C’s off-air fillers these days. Do they still include text on-screen about when the channel will be back on, along with a Viewers Helpline number? Remember how common that used to be in older off-air fillers, giving it that personal touch even when the channel was taking a break. NostalgiaNerys: I’ve noticed they’ve been pretty innovative with their off-air content (like the sleeping blob animation we were all charmed by!), but I haven’t seen timings or a helpline number recently. It seems like they’ve moved towards a more visual and less text-heavy approach during these times. DigitalDewi: Yeah, @NostalgiaNerys is right. The focus has definitely shifted towards keeping the off-air filler visually engaging rather than informational. However, that being said, I believe during some specific transitions or maintenance windows, they do sometimes include a return time, but it’s not a constant feature like before. TechieTaran: You're both right. The current trend is towards creating a seamless viewing experience, even when the channel is off air. Yet, for viewers needing assistance or those curious about programming, S4C has bolstered its digital platforms, including social media and its website, which now serve as the primary sources for that kind of information. ViewerSupportSiân: While the on-screen text might be minimized, S4C’s commitment to viewer support hasn't waned. The helpline and support services have just evolved to be more accessible through different means, like online chat or direct phone lines available during certain hours on their website. ClassicTVChris: Makes sense, thanks for the updates! I do miss those simple text reminders and the helpline number; it had a certain reassuring presence. But I understand the shift towards modernizing and streamlining viewer communication. The digital alternative is convenient, and I’ve found their online support to be quite responsive. RetroRhodri: Indeed, @ClassicTVChris, there was a certain charm to those old fillers. But evolution is key, and it’s great to see S4C adapting with time. Plus, with advancements in digital communication, it’s probably more efficient for viewers to find schedule info and support online. TechieTaran: Absolutely, @RetroRhodri. And let's not forget, those charming mascot animations and creative fillers do an excellent job of keeping the channel's personality alive, even in the digital age. It's about balancing nostalgia with the needs and conveniences of today's audience. ClassicTVChris: Well said! It’s about looking forward while cherishing the past. S4C’s evolution in viewer communication and off-air content really does highlight their commitment to both innovation and viewer engagement. Can’t wait to see what they come up with next! ViewerSupportSiân: Agreed! And always remember, the helpline and support services are there, just in a more modern format.

Voici la def des cognats : In historical linguistics, cognates or lexical cognates are sets of words that have been inherited in direct descent from an etymological ancestor in a common parent language.Because language change can have radical effects on both the sound and the meaning of a word, cognates may not be obvious, and it often takes rigorous study of historical sources and the application of the comparative method to establish whether lexemes are cognate.

Cela nécessite souvent une étude approfondie pour établir la relation de cognat entre les lexèmes. Dans ce contexte, \\"library\\" (anglais) et \\"librairie\\" (français) peuvent être considérés comme des cognats car ils dérivent tous deux du latin \\"libraria\\" (un lieu pour les livres), partageant ainsi un ancêtre étymologique commun.

Внутри этой функции, используя арифметику указателей, вы можете изменять элементы массива. Возьмем пример. Пусть у нас есть структура \`Person\`, и мы хотим изменить возраст каждого \`Person\` в массиве. Сначала определим структуру: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> using namespace std; struct Person { string name; int age; // Конструктор для удобства Person(string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {} }; \`\`\` Теперь напишем функцию, которая будет изменять возраст каждого человека в массиве: \`\`\`cpp void ageIncrement(Person* array, size_t size) { for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) { (array + i)->age++; // Или array[i].age++; } } \`\`\` Эта функция принимает указатель на массив \`Person\` и его размер. При помощи цикла и арифметики указателей (или просто индексации) мы увеличиваем возраст каждого \`Person\` в массиве.

Вот как это можно сделать правильно: # Использование Динамического Выделения Памяти Если вы хотите иметь массив указателей на \`Person\`, вам нужно будет выделить память под каждый объект \`Person\`: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> using namespace std; struct Person { string name; int age; Person(string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {} }; void ageIncrement(Person** array, size_t size) { for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) { array[i]->age++; // Используем индексацию для доступа к объекту и увеличиваем его возраст } } int main() { // Создаем массив указателей на Person Person* people[] = {new Person(\\"Alice\\", 30), new Person(\\"Bob\\", 25), new Person(\\"Charlie\\", 20)}; size_t peopleSize = sizeof(people) / sizeof(people[0]); // До изменения for(size_t i = 0; i < peopleSize; ++i) { cout << people[i]->name << \\" is \\" << people[i]->age << \\" years old.\\" << endl; } // Изменяем возраст ageIncrement(people, peopleSize); cout << \\"nAfter incrementing age:n\\"; // После изменения for(size_t i = 0; i < peopleSize; ++i) { cout << people[i]->name << \\" is \\" << people[i]->age << \\" years old.\\" << endl; } // Освобождаем выделенную память for(size_t i = 0; i < peopleSize; ++i) { delete people[i]; } return 0; } \`\`\` Этот пример подходит если вам нужен именно массив указателей. Важно помнить об освобождении памяти, выделенной с помощью \`new\` для предотвращения утечек памяти. # Статическая и Автоматическая Инициализация Если использование динамической памяти необязательно, можно обойтись статической или автоматической памятью: \`\`\`cpp Person p1(\\"Alice\\", 30); Person p2(\\"Bob\\", 25); Person p3(\\"Charlie\\", 20); Person* people[] = {&p1, &p2, &p3}; \`\`\` Это создаст массив указателей на уже существующие объекты \`Person\`.

Carecía de pelo, pero lucía una larga barba de tonos oscuros que ondeaba como las sombras mismas. Sus ojos eran dos abismos sin fin, capaces de contemplar la creación y la destrucción con igual indiferencia. Dotado con el don de la creación, podía conjurar realidades con un mero pensamiento, tejendo los hilos del destino y la materialidad a su voluntad. Herobrine, por otro lado, contrastaba con su hermano mayor no solo en apariencia, portando cabello castaño y una perilla meticulosamente cuidada, sino también en esencia. Sus ojos, desprovistos de iris y pupilas, eran blancos como el más puro de los inviernos, reflejando su alma perturbada.

Esta dicotomía de creación y destrucción mantenía en un frágil equilibrio al universo, pero la envidia y la malicia corroían el corazón de Herobrine. El menor de los dioses, consumido por el deseo de usurpar los poderes de su hermano, recurrió a las artes más oscuras y traicionó a Notch con un veneno letal, el veneno marchitable. La batalla que siguió fue titánica. Planos de existencia se desdoblaron bajo la furia de los hermanos divinos. Estrellas nacieron y murieron al compás de su confrontación. Finalmente, contenidos por un último esfuerzo, Notch, debilitado por el veneno que ahora corrompía su esencia divina, confrontó a Herobrine con palabras que resonaron a través de la eternidad: \\"Herobrine, ¿qué me has hecho?

No podía permitir que su hermano corrompiera el cosmos con su destrucción. Con una porción de su esencia que aún no estaba corrompida, forjó cinco objetos de poder incalculable, dispersándolos a través del cosmos. Estos artefactos portarían una fracción de su poder creativo, esperando que, en manos adecuadas, fueran capaces de frenar la marea destructiva de Herobrine. Así, con estos actos de esperanza y desesperación, se tejieron los destinos de incontables mundos. Notch, incluso al borde de la aniquilación, legó al universo una oportunidad de resistir contra la corrupción encarnada por su hermano.

Entonces Alex se resbaló y se empezó a caer, dió un salto en la pared y llegó a la otra isla. •Eso no me lo esperaba:Dijo Alex sorprendido. Alex exploró más esa isla hasta que llegó a una ruinas de lo que parecía una plaza. En la plaza había cinco pilares: El primer pilar era naranja y tenía proyectiles incrustados. El segundo pilar era rosa y parecía tener mecanismos dentro de él. El tercero era rojo y parecía tener un aura de luz roja alrededor. El cuarto era de ladrillos negros con musgo arriba. El quinto parecía tener jeroglíficos de armas. Alex iba a tocar el tercero hasta que se dió cuenta de que alguien le vigilaba,se giró y vio al dios menor. El dios se acercó rápidamente hacia Alex hasta que derrepente Alex se despertó asustado, resulta que todo fue un sueño.","output":"**Capítulo 2: Un lugar extraño** En el confín de un sueño, o tal vez de una realidad distante, Alex 99999 emergió a la conciencia en medio de un entorno que desafiaba toda lógica. Había despertado sobre las ruinas de unas islas flotantes, suspendidas en un vacío que parecía tanto eterno como efímero. Alex, un joven de trece años con una fisionomía distintiva —alto, delgado, pelo castaño, un notable bigote en forma de T aplastada y ojos de una peculiar combinación de azul y negro—, llevaba ropas que narraban las historias de sus aventuras pasadas: una camisa roja, peto azul, botas marrones, una gorra roja adornada con un semicírculo blanco, y guantes blancos. Estas no eran meras prendas, sino los emblemas de sus roles en su comunidad: médico, alcalde, y el cuidadoso guardián de las finanzas del banco. La confusión se apoderó de Alex; no había recuerdos que le indicaran cómo había llegado a este extraño lugar. Movido por un instinto de exploración, aunque bañado en temor, se aventuró a través de las islas flotantes. Fue entonces, al borde del abismo, cuando el miedo lo asaltó con fuerza, un temor a lo desconocido, a la imposibilidad de alcanzar la isla opuesta o de escalar sus escarpadas paredes. La tragedia parecía inminente cuando Alex resbaló, cayendo hacia el vacío interminable. Pero en un acto casi reflejo, impulsado por un ímpetu desconocido, se lanzó contra la pared, propulsándose hacia arriba y logrando aterrizar en la otra isla. \\"Eso no me lo esperaba\\", murmuró, sorprendido por su propia capacidad de superar los obstáculos aparentemente insuperables. Su exploración lo llevó a las ruinas de lo que alguna vez fue una gran plaza, ahora custodiada por cinco pilares, cada uno un enigma envuelto en material y esencia. El naranja portaba proyectiles incrustados, el rosa ocultaba mecanismos internos, el rojo irradiaba un aura lumínica, el cuarto pilar, hecho de ladrillo negro, estaba adornado con musgo, y el último estaba cubierto de jeroglíficos que hablaban de armas antiguas. Intrigado por el pilar rojo, Alex se acercó, pero algo detuvo su mano antes de tocarlo. Una presencia lo observaba, pesada y ominosa. Al darse la vuelta, se encontró frente a frente con el mismo deus ex machina de su inesperada aventura: el dios menor, Herobrine. Con una velocidad sobrenatural, el dios se acercó a él, el miedo y la anticipación se multiplicaron en el aire... Pero entonces, Alex despertó. Su corazón latía acelerado, su respiración era agitada. Alrededor, solo la familiaridad de su propio mundo, tan lejano de las islas flotantes y de aquella confrontación divina. ¿Fue todo un sueño? Un espejismo creado por su mente, o tal vez una visión otorgada o afligida por fuerzas desconocidas. Independientemente, el encuentro onírico con Herobrine presagiaba una aventura mayor, una búsqueda que recién comenzaba y que, sin saberlo, lo llevaría a cruzar los umbrales entre mundos, sueños y realidades."},{"instruction":"Capítulo 3: El elegido especial. Ahora en el planeta Méleg Válaza en la actualidad Alex salió de su casa. Alex iba al Inferior, una cueva roja muy profunda a por cuarzo para el baño de su hermana Marta usando un Portal Inferior. Marta es una chica de 9 años Por el camino, se encontró a su amigo Mario el cual buscaba a su loro. Mario es el que cuidaba los animales en Méleg Válaza. •Tal vez está en el inferior porque estás cerca del portal:Le dijo Alex Ambos entraron al portal pero Alex se dio cuenta de algo distinto, mientras viajaba vio unos túneles donde ciertas personas estaban pero cuando se lo mencionó a Mario él le dijo que no veía nada raro. Entonces Alex y las 4 personas que vio cayeron de los túneles hacia un agujero universal.","output":"**Capítulo 3: El elegido especial** El día en Méleg Válaza amaneció con la tranquilidad que precede a las grandes aventuras. Alex, ahora de vuelta en la realidad palpable de su planeta natal, se alistó para una tarea que, aunque parecía menuda, estaba a punto de llevarlo por senderos que cruzan los límites de lo imaginable. Necesitaba cuarzo, no por capricho, sino por amor fraternal, pues se proponía embellecer el baño de su hermana Marta, una jovencita de nueve años cuyas sonrisas iluminaban su hogar. El destino elegido para esta misión era el Inferior, una cueva roja profunda, conocida por sus riquezas minerales, a la que se accedía mediante un Portal Inferior. Este portal, a diferencia de los que llevaban a otros mundos, se hundía en las entrañas del propio planeta, revelando secretos ocultos bajo su corteza. Por el camino, se topó con su amigo Mario, un hombre dedicado al cuidado de los animales de Méleg Válaza. La preocupación marcaba su rostro; su loro, compañero de incontables jornadas, se había perdido. “Tal vez está en el Inferior porque estás cerca del portal”, sugirió Alex, intentando infundir algo de esperanza. Unidos por la preocupación y el afán de aventura, ambos se adentraron en el portal. Sin embargo, lo que debía ser un viaje habitual a través del portal Inferior tomó un giro inesperado para Alex. En medio del trayecto, percibió algo que desafiaba la lógica: túneles que se ramificaban desde su ruta, habitados por figuras que, aunque etéreas, le eran claramente visibles. Mario, por su parte, no advertía nada fuera de lo común, lo que sumió a Alex en un mar de dudas y asombro. ¿Acaso estos seres eran un espejismo, o había algo más en sus habilidades, un don ignoto que empezaba a despertar? En un evento sin precedentes, Alex y las figuras que había visto, cuatro en total, fueron arrastrados por una fuerza desconocida fuera de sus dimensiones actuales. Cayeron juntos hacia lo que Alex solo podía describir como un agujero universal, una fisura en el tejido mismo del cosmos que desafía toda comprensión. Este incidente marca el principio de la transformación de Alex, pues aquellos seres no eran simples alucinaciones; eran otros elegidos, conectados con él por hilos del destino aún invisibles. A través de este agujero universal, serían llevados hacia un destino que desafía la imaginación, una misión que trascendería los márgenes conocidos del universo y pondría a prueba su verdadero potencial. Lo que empezó como una jornada para cumplir con un acto de bondad fraterna había derivado en el umbral de una epopeya. Alex, sin saberlo aún, había sido seleccionado por fuerzas cósmicas como un \\"elegido especial\\", destinado a navegar por realidades que se entrelazan en la vastedad del cosmos, un viaje que apenas estaba comenzando y que prometía revelar los misterios más profundos del ser y del universo."},{"instruction":"hey i'm really upset now","output":"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling upset.

It combines the concepts of Mother's Day and Father's Day, celebrated elsewhere, into one. Given this context, it's understandable that such an occasion can bring about a range of emotions, from joy and appreciation to perhaps complexity and melancholy, depending on an individual's personal circumstances and relationships. If you're feeling upset as this day approaches, it may be tied to your feelings or experiences related to your own parents or family situation. Sometimes, days like these can remind us of what we wish was different in our relationships or bring up memories that are challenging. Regardless of the specific reasons, it’s perfectly valid to experience a mix of feelings, and it can be helpful to talk about them.

Parents often worry about their children's finances and might prefer practicality over gestures that they perceive as extravagant. It doesn't mean she isn't appreciative of your thoughtfulness; she might just have a different way of expressing her love and care. If you haven't already, it might be worthwhile to have a conversation with your mom to share your feelings and intentions behind the surprise. You can explain that while you understand her concerns about money, your decision to book the hotel was a special way of showing your love and appreciation for them on Parents' Day. You can also reassure her that you've made this decision within your means and that celebrating them in this way is important to you.

You put a lot of thought and effort into planning something special for Parents' Day with the intention of showing your love and appreciation. When the response you receive doesn't match the warmth and love behind your gesture, it can be deeply upsetting. Anger is a natural emotion, especially when we feel misunderstood or our efforts aren't received as we had hoped. However, it can also be a chance for growth and understanding in a relationship. Here are a few steps you might consider to navigate through these feelings: 1. **Allow Yourself to Feel**: Firstly, it's okay to feel angry. Acknowledge your feelings as valid instead of pushing them away. Sometimes, just admitting to ourselves that we're angry can help to lessen the intensity of those feelings. 2. **Reflect on the Underlying Reasons**: Often, anger can be a surface emotion that masks other feelings, such as hurt, disappointment, or feeling unappreciated. Understanding the deeper reasons behind your anger can help in addressing the root cause and in finding a way forward. 3. **Find a Healthy Outlet**: Before addressing the situation with your mom, it might help to find a way to express your anger that doesn’t damage your relationship. This could be through physical activity, such as going for a walk or run, or through creative expression, like writing or art. 4. **Plan a Conversation**: Once you feel a bit calmer, consider planning a conversation with your mom. It could be helpful to express your feelings using \\"I\\" statements, such as \\"I felt hurt when my gesture was met with concern about spending, as I was hoping to create a special memory.\\" This can help in communicating your feelings without placing blame. 5. **Seek Understanding**: During your conversation, try to also understand her perspective. Perhaps her concerns come from a place of love and care, albeit expressed in a way that was hurtful to you. 6. **Set Boundaries and Seek Compromise**: If financial concerns are a significant issue, discuss ways you can both feel comfortable expressing appreciation and love within those bounds. Discussing boundaries openly can prevent similar situations in the future. Remember, it’s okay to seek support from friends or a professional if navigating these emotions and conversations feels too overwhelming. Reaching understanding and resolution can take time, and it’s okay to move through this process at your own pace."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like you might be taking a moment, which is perfectly fine.

They were two orange gelatinous creatures named Gloop and Blop. Not quite like anything else in Zogar, Gloop and Blop were made entirely of a bouncy, squishy substance that allowed them to stretch, squish, and mold into almost any shape imaginable. Gloop was a tad more reserved of the two, always thoughtful and meticulously planning their next adventure. Blop, on the other hand, was the epitome of spontaneity, acting on whims and letting their gelatinous form flow freely with excitement at the prospect of something new and thrilling. Despite their differences, their friendship was as solid as it could get, and together they made an unstoppable duo, exploring every nook and cranny of Zogar with boundless enthusiasm. One day, Gloop and Blop discovered an ancient map hidden in the recesses of the city library. The map outlined the location of a legendary treasure, said to grant anyone who found it the ability to shape the very fabric of reality. This treasure was hidden deep within the mysterious and uncharted Gooey Woods, a place rumored to be filled with wonders and dangers unlike any seen in Zogar. The prospect of such an adventure set their gelatinous hearts racing. After making meticulous preparations (courtesy of Gloop) and ensuring they had enough snacks for the road (Blop's indispensable contribution), they set out towards the Gooey Woods, their spirits high and their bodies wobbling with excitement. Gooey Woods was a mesmerizing place. The trees were tall and covered in luminous moss, casting everything in an ethereal glow. Strange, colorful creatures flitted between the trees, watching the orange visitors with curious eyes. The deeper Gloop and Blop ventured, the stranger and more beautiful the forest became. They found themselves navigating through tricky terrains, stretching over wide chasms, squeezing through narrow crevices, and even bouncing high up to reach paths that winded ever upward. Their journey was not without its challenges, though. They encountered puzzling obstacles and mysterious riddles that tested their wit and resolve. At every turn, they had to work together, combining Gloop's strategic mind and Blop's creative impulses, always finding innovative ways to use their unique gelatinous abilities to progress. Finally, after what felt like countless twist and turns, Gloop and Blop stumbled upon a clearing. In its center stood an ancient pedestal, atop which lay a shimmering jewel. It was the treasure they had been seeking. As they approached, they realized that the journey had changed them. They were no longer just two gelatinous creatures on an adventure; they had grown, learned, and most importantly, their friendship had deepened in ways they could have never imagined. Together, they reached for the jewel, and in a burst of light, it fused with them, granting them the power they had sought. But as they stood there, transformed and awestruck, they realized that the true treasure was not the ability to shape reality, but the journey they had shared and the unbreakable bond they had forged. Gloop and Blop returned to Zogar, not just as adventurers, but as legends. They used their newfound abilities to help the city in ways they never thought possible, always together, always inseparable. And as they looked back on their adventure, they knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, their friendship would see them through. So, in the heart of a city soaring high above the clouds, two orange gelatinous creatures lived out their days, forever ready for the next adventure, forever best of friends."},{"instruction":"Write about their appearances","output":"Gloop and Blop, though both distinctly orange and gelatinous, had appearances that reflected their unique personalities and the various adventures they had embarked upon. Gloop, the more thoughtful of the duo, had a slightly denser and more composed form. His surface was smooth, with a consistency akin to thick syrup, allowing him to maintain a more defined shape. His gelatinous body was a deep, rich shade of orange, like the glow of a sunset. Embedded within his translucent form were tiny, shimmering particles, relics of the ancient map that had guided them to the treasure. These particles would sparkle with a faint light whenever Gloop was deep in thought, plotting their next course or pondering a difficult puzzle. His eyes, two darker orange orbs, emanated a calm and steady gaze, reflecting his thoughtful and meticulous nature. Blop, on the other hand, was the embodiment of spontaneity and joy. His form was much more fluid and erratic, constantly changing shape in a display of exuberance and creativity. Blop's orange was a lighter, more vibrant hue, almost glowing with an inner zest for life. His surface was less uniform than Gloop's, dotted with splotches of various shades of orange that pulsated and changed as he moved. Blop's eyes were larger and rounder, always wide with wonder and excitement, mirroring his enthusiastic and impulsive personality. Both Gloop and Blop had the remarkable ability to stretch and contort their bodies into a myriad of shapes. This ability allowed them to express themselves in unique ways, their forms shifting with their moods and thoughts. When they laughed, which was often, they would jiggle and bounce, their whole bodies becoming waves of mirth. When they focused, especially in the face of an obstacle during their adventure, they could become sleek and streamlined, ready to slip through the tiniest crack or stretch across chasms. Despite their distinct differences, Gloop and Blop shared a few features that underscored their unity and deep connection. Both had small but noticeable tendrils that they could extend from their bodies at will, useful for exploring their surroundings or holding onto each other in moments of excitement or reassurance. They also shared a luminescence that became more pronounced when they were together, a soft glow that seemed to signify the strength of their bond. Through their journey to the Gooey Woods and beyond, the wear and tear of the adventure did little to change their essential appearances. Instead, it added to their character, like badges of honor. Each new scrape or mark from the obstacles they faced became a part of their story, a visible reminder of their bravery, determination, and the unbreakable friendship that carried them through it all."},{"instruction":"请将“「外国貿易によって，一方では不変資本の諸要素が安くなり，他方では可変資本が転化される必要生活手段が安くなるかぎりでは，外国貿易は利潤率を高める作用をする。というのは，それは剩余価値率を高め，不変資本の価値を低くするからである。外国貿易は一般にこのような意味で作用する。というのは，それは生産規模の拡大を可能にするからである。こうして，外国貿易は一方で蓄積を促進するが，他方ではまた不変資本に比べての可変資本の減少，したがって利潤率の低下をも促進するのである」。 資本主義的市場の拡大の，したがってまた傾向として，資本主義的生産様式の拡大の機能という形での外国貿易は，交換価値の担い手として機能する使用価値の量と種類を幾倍にもする。 -「剩余労働あるいは剩余価値はただ一国的剰余生産物のなかでのみ表現されるとすれば，価値のための価値の増大は，それゆえ，剩余労働への渇望は，労働の価値がそのなかに現われるところの使用価値の狭い範囲という制約によって，ある限界に逢着するであろう。それゆえ，第一に，外国貿易は価値としての剰余価値の真の本性を発展させる。というのは，そこでは，そのなかに含まれる労働を社会的労働として発展させ，それが限りなくさまざまな使用価値のなかに現われ，実際に，抽象的富に意味をもたせるからである」。- そして，外国貿易は購買力ある需要の範囲を拡げ，より分化された分業，専門化，したがって生産の低廉化，つまり，通常，最大の資本によって特別好都合に利用されらる諸要因の諸利点のための可能性をひらく。それらは総じて，拡大していく資本にとって，ますます大きな意味をもつことになる。この拡大していく資本は，すでに摂収された販売市場ないし潜在的に重要な販売市場の保全，ならびに固有の競争力の保全のために，ますます国家装置をとり込まなければならないのである。資本の欲求にとって必然的な制約のない統一市場が，国家という形で分立するという事実から経済的に根拠づけられた政治的帰結として，一国的国家装置の帝国主義的政策が結果する。そのかぎりで，国家の政治的権力は資本の価値増殖利害の直接的構成部分になる。国境ごとに区切られた諸国家のアンサンブルとしての世界市場の独特の組織のうちに，そして，価値法則の作用様式の部分修正としてのブルジョア国家の経済的形態規定のうちに，その根拠をもって，外国貿易にはその市場拡大機能からすすんで，剰余価値の配分を集権化する道具としての重みが付与されてくる。意味するところは，いわゆる「不等価交換」の現象，すなわち，持続的に設定される価値量ないし労働量の不平等な交換の現象である。 労働強度における相違は，等しい生産性においては商品の価値に関係するようになる。 「それ故，強度のより大きい一国的労働は，より小さい強度のそれとくらべて同一時間内でより多くの価値を生産する」。 メトロポーレンペリフニリーこの相違は，絶対的剰余価値量の違いを内包するが，中 枢と周 辺との関係にとってはとくに，相対的剰余価値生産における落差がより決定的な意味をもつのである。労働の生産性の相違は，商品の総価値に占める剰余価値の割合を異ならしめる。 「ある一国で資本主義生産が発達していれば，それと同じ割合で，そこでは労働の一国的強度も生産性も国際的水準を凌駕している。だから，さまざまな国々で同一労働時間内に生産される同種の商品の異なる量は，それゆえ等しくない国際的価値をもつ」。 仮説的に，商品の世界市場価格は生産価格と比較できる。生産価格と資本の有機的構成との関係にはつぎのことが妥当する。 「ある商品の価値に対するその商品の生産価格の割合は，もっぱらその商品を生産する可変資本の不変資本に対する割合によって，あるいは，その商品を生産する資本の有機的構成によって規定される。もし，ある生産領域の資本の構成が社会的平均資本の構成よりも低いならば，すなわち，その資本のうち労賃に投ぜられる可変成分が物質労働条件に投ぜられる不変成分に対する割合からみて，社会的平均資本の場合よりも大きいならば，その生産物の価値はその生産価格よりも高くなければならない。すなわち，このような資本は社会的平均資本の同じ大きさの一可除部分に比べて，それよりも多くの生きた労働を充用するので，同程度の労働搾取でより多くの剰余価値を生産し，したがってまた，より多くの利潤を生産するのである。それゆえ，この資本の生産物の価値はその生産価格よりも高いのである。なぜならば，この生産価格は，資本補塡プラス平均利潤に等しく，この平均利潤はこの商品のなかで生産された利潤よりも低いからである。社会的平均資本によって生産される剰余価値は，このような構成の低い資本によって生産される剰余価値よりも小さい。その逆になるのは，ある一定の生産領域で投下された資本の構成が社会的平均資本の構成よりも高い場合である。この資本によって生産される商品の価値は，その生産価格よりも低いのであって，これは最も発達した産業の生産物の場合に一般的なことである。もし一定の生産領域での資本の構成が社会的平均資本の構成よりも低いならば，これはさしあたりはただ，この特殊な生産領域での社会的労働の生産力が平均水準よりも低いということの別の表現でしかない。なぜならば，生産力が到達した段階は，可変資本部分に対して不変資本部分が相対的に優勢だということのうちに，または与えられた一資本のうちの労賃に投ぜられる構成部分が絶えず減っていくことのうちに現われるからである。反対に，もし，ある一定の生産領域での資本の構成が平均よりも高ければ，これは生産力の発展が平均水準よりも高(227)いということを表わしているのである」。 もちろん-そして，まさにこれが世界市場での価値法則の作用様式の部分修正を生みだすのだが，世界市場において，利潤率の相違性を平均利潤率という形で均すような資本の平均化諸運動が妨げられることなく生ずるわけではない。事実，平均化が停止され，資本の価値構成における持続的な落差が存在するので，世界市場では不等労働量が交換されるものである。”翻译为中文","output":"通过外贸，一方面，不变资本的各要素变得便宜，另一方面，转化为可变资本所必需的生活手段也变得便宜，这样外贸就会提高利润率。这是因为它提高了剩余价值率并降低了不变资本的价值。外贸通常就是以这种意义起作用的，因为它使生产规模的扩大成为可能。因此，外贸一方面促进了积累，另一方面也促进了相对于不变资本的可变资本的减少，因而也促进了利润率的下降。 作为资本主义市场扩大的功能，因而作为资本主义生产方式扩大的趋势，外国贸易使作为价值载体功能的使用价值的数量和种类增加了几倍。 -如果剩余劳动或剩余价值只能在一个国家的剩余生产物中表现，那么价值的增长，因此对剩余劳动的渴望，会遇到一个界限，因为价值在其中表现出来的使用价值范围有限。因此，首先，外国贸易发展了剩余价值作为价值的真实本质。这是因为它将包含其中的劳动发展为社会劳动，使其在无限多样的使用价值中表现出来，实际上，给抽象财富赋予了意义。- 外贸扩大了具有购买力需求的范围，通过更分化的分工、专业化，因此生产的降低成本，通常，被特别有利的最大资本所利用的各种优势的可能性。总的来说，这对于不断扩大的资本来说意味着越来越重要。这种不断扩大的资本需要吸纳现有的销售市场或潜在的重要销售市场以及保持其固有的竞争力，因此必须越来越多地包含国家机器。由于市场的统一无可避免的限制以国家形式分立的事实，作为经济上的政治后果产生了民族国家装置的帝国主义政策。在这个意义上，国家的政治权力成为资本增值利益的直接组成部分。在世界市场作为划分为各国家组合的独特组织中，以及作为资产阶级国家经济形态决定中价值规律作用方式的部分修正的基础上，外贸具有从市场扩大功能进一步到集中剩余价值分配的工具的重要性。这意味着所谓的“不等价交换”现象，即持续设定的不等价值量或劳动量的交换现象。 劳动强度的差异，即相同生产力下商品价值的相关因素。 “因此，强度较大的国家劳动与强度较小的国家劳动相比，在同一时间内生产更多的价值”。 中心与周边关系特别是，在相对剩余价值生产中的差距带有更决定性的意义的是绝对剩余价值量的差异。劳动生产力的差异将改变剩余价值在商品总价值中的比例。 “如果某国的资本主义生产发达，那么在相同的比例中，那里的国家劳动的强度和生产力也超过了国际标准。因此，各国在相同劳动时间内生产的相同类型的商品的不同数量，因此具有不等的国际价值”。 假设商品的世界市场价格可以与生产价格相比较。商品的价值与其生产价格的比例仅仅由生产该商品的可变资本与不变资本的比率决定，或者说，由生产该商品的资本的有机构成决定。如果某一生产领域的资本构成低于社会平均资本的构成，即如果该资本中用于工资的可变部分与用于物质劳动条件的不变部分的比率比社会平均资本的情况大，那么该生产物的价值必须高于其生产价格。这是因为这样的资本比相同大小的社会平均资本的一部分能够吸纳更多的活劳动，因此在相同程度的劳动剥削下生产更多的剩余价值，因而也产生更多的利润。因此，这种资本的产品的价值高于其生产价格。这是因为这种生产价格等同于资本成本加上平均利润，而这平均利润低于在这种商品中产生的利润。由社会平均资本生产的剩余价值小于由这种低构成的资本生产的剩余价值。相反的情况出现在投入某一特定生产领域的资本构成高于社会平均资本的构成时。由这种资本生产的商品的价值将低于其生产价格，这是最发达产业的产品的普遍情况。如果某一特定生产领域中的资本构成低于社会平均资本的构成，这仅仅表示这个特殊生产领域中的社会劳动生产力低于平均水平的另一种表达。这是因为达到的生产力水平表现在不变资本部分相对于可变资本部分占优势，或者在给定资本中投入工资的成分不断减少。相反，如果某一特定生产领域中的资本构成高于平均值，这表示生产力发展高于平均水平”。 当然——这正是世界市场上价值法则作用方式的部分修正之所在，但在世界市场上，并不是没有阻碍就能发生将利润率的差异化为平均利润率形式的资本平均化运动。事实上，因为平均化被停止，资本的价值构成中存在持续的差距，世界市场上发生的是不等劳动量的交换。"},{"instruction":"请将“「この恵まれた国は，より少ない労働とひきかえにより多くの労働をとり返すのである。といっても，この差額，この剩余は，労働と資本との間の交換で一般にそうであるように，ある階級の懐中に取込まれてしまうのであるが」。 それゆえ，国際市場ではつぎのことが可能である。つまり，「個々の資本家ばかりでなく，諸国民もまた相互にひきつづき交換し，しかも諸国民はそのために一様に利得する必要もないままに，たえずますます増大する規模でひきつづき交換をくりかえすということ〔である〕。一方の諸国民は他方の諸国民の剩余労働の一部をひきつづきわがものとすることができるのである」。 落差の持続性のために恒常的に，低開発国から資本主義的により高度に発展した国へ剩余価値が流れこんでくるようになる。したがって，発展した国の利潤率は資本の有機的構成が同時に高まることなく高くなるのである。こうして，メトロポーレン不等価交換は中 枢における利潤率の傾向的低下に反対に作用する傾向として機能する。 不等価交換というものは，原理的には市場でのあらゆる交換行為において生じうることである。けれども，不等価交換は一国的に制限された市場の内部においては資本の諸運動，個別資本の破産，あるいは計画への国家の介入を喚起するが，国際市場では別の質をもつ。ここでもまた当然のことながら，不等交換は調停されうるのであるが，それはつぎのことによってである。すなわち，ひとつの複合的貿易構造という文脈においては，大体において交換不等性は相殺されるということによって，そして各国資本がおおよそ同じくらいの大きさの生産性であることによって，あるいは資本の可動性-もちろん，それは国メトロポーレン家の介入がなければ，中 枢での独占化された資本にだけ可能であるが-によってである。しかし，世界市場では発展の程度が非常に異なっている各国資本が対峙しており，進歩の度合の異なった生産力発展を土台として，その個々の輸出構造が，交換される商品類型に関して相対的一面性を示しているので，各国資本の国家的組織形態から帰結し，帝国主義的諸国家の相応する諸方策によって尖鋭化されながら，恒久的な価値移転が生ずるのである。 「一国内部での損失と利得は相殺される。ちがった国の間ではそうではない（······）。ある国の三労働日は他の国の一労働日と交換されうる。ここでは価値法則が本質的な修正をこうむる。いいかえれば，一国の内部で熟練した複雑な労働が未熟練で単純な労働に対する関係と同様に，いろいろな国の労働日もふるまうことができるのである。この場合には，富んだ国がより貧しい国を搾取することになる。たとえ後者が交換によって利益を得る場合でさえ，そうである」。 国境で区切られた国家という形態での，特殊緊密なひとつの分業連関を伴う各国資本の政治組織と，個別諸国家への資本主義的世界市場の分離化とは，結局，こうした不等価交換の可能性の条件である。利潤率の均衡は恒常的にさまたげられる。一国資本に対する関係におけるブルジョア国家に比肩するような，独占的分割の最も著しい形態に対する補塡的処置を講ずるような介入的機関も存在しないのである。価値法則はその作用様式において修正される。そして，この修正自体は，低開発諸国からの恒久的価値流出が傾向として，自由な資本デイスパリテート流動においてさえ，もはやいかなる均衡過程もおこらないという不均等状況を創出するかぎり，総資本の再生産の経過を規定するようになる。 パリフェリー メトロポーレン不等価交換を通じての周 辺から中 枢への恒久的な価値移譲は，周辺諸国家が独自の資本を充分に蓄積し，傾向として，より競争力をもつようになることや，価値移転をストップさせたり，あるいは少なくとも価値移転を減じたりすることをさまたげる。反対に格差はますます大きくなる。それは，ひとつの展開された世界市場と極端に不平等な競争という諸条件のもとにある諸国家の資本主義的工業化が負う構造的負債とならんで，周辺諸国において労働力商品の価格がその価値以下に眼にみえて沈下することの理由である。換言すれば，経済的辺境における貧困の増大の理由である。そもそも世界市場に登場しうるためには，相対的に低い生産性，すなわち，必要労働の占める分が相対的に高いこと，したがって他と比較して相対的剰余価値率が低いことは，労働力の価格を価値以下にドラスティックに下げることによって絶対的剰余価値生産を高めるということを余儀なくさせる。しばしば極端な諸条件のもとで搾り出されるメトロポーレンこうした剩余価値は，既存の交換条件のもとではかなりの量が中 枢の資本の手中に流れ込む。周辺諸国家の対抗措置の可能性は無視しうるほどわずかである。ことに，国家装置自体が通常，直接的であれ間接的であれ外国から資金を得ているからである。 メトロポーレン中 枢の資本にとっては，さほど儲けの多くない直接投資をおこなうかわりに，不等価交換を通じての「剩余価値注入」を保持することの方が，はるかに有利であり，たしかなものとしてより危険が小さい。そのことのうちに同時に，資本の危機もより具体的に現れる。すなわち，ただたんに剩余価値の不足のために資本は全世界生産を貫通的に資本主義化することができないだけではない。恐慌で揺れることになる繁栄を維持し，剰余価値生産の中心で困難になっている価値増殖を維持しうるためにも資本はまさに外からの剰余価値の流入を頼みにしているのである。したがって，経済発展の不均等性はもちろん尖鋭化され，それ自体がふたたび，自らをとき放ち鋭くする諸運動と矛盾するようになる。 資本主義的生産過程に固有の矛盾，すなわち，資本主義的生産過程が進むにつれて，利潤率の傾向的低下を惹起し，尖鋭化し，そして同時に，「生産力上昇の物質的手段でさえ」ある矛盾は，必然的に，そして折々の新たな再生産の段階で，集積の拡大された諸形態を推しすすめる。生産過程の技術的改良に際して，利潤率の低下を剰余価値率および剰余価値量の上昇によって相殺するのに必要な調達されるべき資本ミニマムは高まる。所与の搾取度と所与の人口を土台にしたある一国資本が，この資本ミニマムをもはや調達しえないならば，蓄積過程は停滞する。資本ミニマムは，一面では有機的構成の高さによって測られ，他方では資本家たちの利潤期待によって測定される。この利潤期待の最低基準とは，「少なくとも充用資本量の増大につれて利潤量が増大する〔ということであり〕，したがって，資本の増大に比例する利潤率の低下あるいは資本の増大よりも急速でさえある利潤率の低下といったことがありえない」ということである。”翻译为中文","output":"“这个被恩赐的国家因为用较少的劳动换取了更多的劳动，因此获得了差额、剩余，就像劳动与资本之间的交换通常那样，这个剩余被某个阶级揽入了囊中。” 因此，在国际市场上可能发生以下情况：即不仅各个资本家，各个民族也可以相互持续交换，而且这种交换可以不断扩大规模，无需各个民族均匀获益，某些民族可以持续拥有其他民族的剩余劳动部分。 由于差距的持续性，剩余价值持续地从发展不足的国家流向资本主义更高度发达的国家。因此，发达国家的利润率得以提高，而不需要资本的有机构成同时增加。这样，不等价交换作为对中心地区利润率倾向性下降的逆向作用趋势而起作用。 不等价交换原则上可能发生在市场上的任何交换行为中。然而，不等价交换在国内限定市场内可能引发资本的运动、个别资本的破产，或国家对计划的干预，而在国际市场上则具有不同的性质。当然，不等交换是可以被调解的，通过以下方式：即在一个复合贸易结构中，大体上交换不平等被抵消，以及各国资本大致具有相同规模的生产力，或通过资本的流动性——当然，如果没有国家的介入，这只可能存在于中心的垄断资本中。然而，在世界市场上，发展程度极其不同的各国资本相互对峙，在不同进步程度的生产力发展的基础上，各自的出口结构在被交换的商品类别上表现出相对的单一性，由各国资本的国家组织形式导致，并通过帝国主义国家的相应策略而加剧，生成持久的价值转移。 “一个国家内部的损失和收益是互相抵销的。在不同的国家之间则不是这样（······）。一个国家的三个工作日可以与另一个国家的一个工作日交换。这里价值法则遭受本质上的修改。也就是说，就像一个国家内部熟练复杂劳动与未熟练简单劳动间的关系一样，各国的工作日也可以有相同的行为。在这种情况下，富裕的国家会剥削较贫困的国家。即使后者通过交换获得了利益，也是如此。” 作为国家形式区分的国界，伴随着各国资本的特殊紧密分工关系，以及资本主义世界市场对个别国家的分割，最终是不等价交换可能性的条件。利润率的均衡被持续地阻碍。没有类似资本主义对单个国家资本的关系中的资产阶级国家所扮演的角色，即没有对独占分割的最显著形式进行补偿性措施的干预机构。价值法则在其作用方式上被修改。并且，这种修改本身，由于低发展国家持续的价值流出趋势，甚至在自由资本流动中也不再存在任何均衡过程，创造了不平等状态，这定义了总资本再生产的过程。 从周边到中心通过不等价交换的持续价值转移，阻碍了周边国家充分积累自己的资本，并趋向于变得更有竞争力，或至少减少或停止价值转移。相反，差距越来越大。作为发达世界市场和极端不平等竞争条件下资本主义工业化的国家承受的结构性负债，以及该原因导致的周边国家劳动力商品价格明显低于其价值。换言之，经济边缘地区贫困加剧的原因。为了可能出现在世界市场上，相对较低的生产力，即必要劳动占较高比例，因此与他人相比具有较低的相对剩余价值率，这迫使通过大幅度降低劳动力价格以下的价值来增加绝对剩余价值生产。在极端条件下被压榨出来的这种剩余价值，现有交换条件下相当数量流入中心资本手中。周边国家的对策几乎可以忽略。特别是，因为国家机器通常直接或间接地从外国获得资金。 对于中心资本来说，与进行利润不那么丰厚的直接投资相比，通过不等价交换“注入”剩余价值保持更有利、更为确定且风险更小。在这种情况下，资本的危机也更具体地显现。即，不仅仅是因为剩余价值的不足，资本无法全面地资本化全球生产。为了维持易于动荡的繁荣，并保持中心困难增长的价值增长，资本确实依赖于外部剩余价值的流入。因此，经济发展的不平等当然会加剧，并且自身再次成为尖锐化其自身的运动和矛盾。 随着资本主义生产过程的进行，固有的矛盾，即利润率的倾向性下降的激化，同时也是“即使是生产力上升的物质手段”的矛盾，必然并偶尔推动了更扩大的积累形式。在生产过程的技术改进中，通过增加剩余价值率和剩余价值量来抵消利润率下降所需的最低资本水平将会增加。如果一个国家的资本在给定的剥削程度和给定人口的基础上，无法再调配这个最小资本，则积累过程会停滞。资本最小量一方面由有机构成的高度来衡量，另一方面由资本家的利润预期来决定。这种利润预期的最低标准是，“至少随着资本量的增加利润量增加，因此不存在与资本增加成比例的利润率下降或比资本增加更快的利润率下降的情况。”"},{"instruction":"请将“蓄積過程の停滞は資本の過剰生産のうちに表現される。つまり，資本が遊休する。 「〔旧〕資本の一部の遊休化はどういう事情のもとでも生ぜざるをえないであろう。それは，資本が資本として機能し価値増殖されなければならないというかぎりでのその資本属性の遊休化である。どの部分がとくにこの遊休化に該当するのかは競争〔戦〕が決定するであろう」。 (243)この過剰資本，すなわち，「生産に投ぜられるより多くの資本が蓄積され」ているという事実の表現であり，それゆえに，この資本のために，利潤率の傾向的低下が少なくとも利潤量によって止揚されることはないであろうような資本である過剰資本は，同時に労働力の過剰を生ぜしめるであろう。生産諸力の前進的発展につれて資本の有機的構成が高まり，そして，調達されるべき資本ミニマムがますます大きくなるのに直面して生産的資本投下問題が尖鋭化するので，一国資本は，自らの枠内にとどまろうとすれば，ますます，マルクスによって絶対的危機として書かれた地点に近づかざるをえないであろう。 拡大していく資本は，その展開の前進のなかで世界市場を自らのために創出する。一国資本の立場からすれば，世界市場の創出がまず第一に意味したものは，商品のうちに含まれる剩余価値，国境の内側で生産され一国資本によって取得される剩余価値の実現を目的とする商品輸出である。しかし，国境の内側での剰余価値生産が蓄積のさらなる進展にとって不十分になり，剰余価値生産の基盤が拡大されねばならなくなるにつれて，この所与の蓄積諸条件に対し資本として機能しうるためには，資本が輸出されねばならない。 「資本が外国に送られるとすれば，それは資本が国内では絶対に使えないからではない。それは，資本が外国ではより高い利潤率で使えるからである。しかし，この資本は，就業労働者人口にとっても，またその国一般にとって(244)も絶対的に過剰資本である」。 「外国で剩余価値を生みだすよう定められている価値の流出」である資本輸出において，ある一国資本の搾取領域は，一国的限界を超えて拡大される。ただ単に，ひとつの国家の内部で生産された剩余価値が，その国家の限界の外部で実現されるのみならず，その一国資本は，そのように生みだされた剰余価値を意のままに処理しうるためにいまや，外国の労働をも搾取するのである。剰余価値の集中がおこる。そして，この方法でしか一国資本が自らの再生産に必要な剩余価値量を調達できないときに，この集中が生じざるをえないのである。資本主義という土台のうえで生産諸力が前進的に展開するにつれて資本の過剰蓄積傾向が慢性的現象になり，一国資本がますます一国的剰余価値生産の狭隘性を放棄し，資本輸出を手段として外国の労働を利用する形で搾取しなければならなくなればなるほど，それだけ一層こうした強制は大きくなる。 それゆえ，一国資本を資本輸出へと誘導するのは抽象的な利潤率比較ではなく，国内には十分収益性のある投下可能性が具体的に不足していることが利潤率の相違を徹底的に利用することを必然化し，資本を輸出へと強制するのである。そうして，一国資本にとってますます，国家によって確保されている支配領域の外部での収益性のある投資の場所と諸条件が利害の視点に入りこんでくるのであり，他の各国資本との競争が傾向としていたるところに生じ，国家は一国資本の価値増殖利害の対外的にも強力な代理人としての意義を獲得する。一国資本は必然的に帝国主義的になる。 資本輸出にとって，それを発生させる根拠は多様である。古い諸市場は保全されたり，拡大されてあらたに征服されたりすることになる。これは原料源泉と同様である。競争力が潜在的な諸産業は，直接的に協同出資の事業によるものであれ，競争力ある資本の無媒介的市場参加や関税障壁による保護，資本にコントロール 特恵的な諸規制の利用を通して間接的にであれ統制のもとにおかれうる。そして，賃金が低いということは，生産の場所を外へ移すための刺激たりうる。財政的保証も価値増殖に必要な政治的介入にとって，ひとつの役割を果しうる。 資本輸出の諸形態は資本の再生産の基礎の変化とともに歴史的に転換してきた。初期の帝国主義にとっては，外債の発行を媒介にした貸付資本-外債発(251)行についてとくに言及したのはレーニンである-が資本輸出の主要形態とし(252)て重要だった。現在では，貸付資本の輸出は政府や国際的諸制度にだけ特徴的メトロポーレンである。私的資本は直接投資の形態をとっている。この直接投資は中 枢における一国資本の搾取基盤の直接的拡張の表現である。機能している資本に占める固定資本の割合が上昇するにつれて問題になってくる価値増殖の技術的諸条件，加速度的な道徳的磨耗，そして尖鋭化する一国的，国際的な競争，これらが，ただ価値増殖基盤の傾向的国際化によってしか充足されえないほどの高いメトロポーレン要求を，蓄積維持のために掲げさせる。こうした国際化が，中 枢における剰余価値の強度の集中と，一国的および国際的に編み合わされた資本の一層の集積とを伴うからである。 資本輸出の素材的重点およびそれから帰結する地域的重点は，中枢における資本のそのときどきの到達した再生産諸条件から決定される。周辺からさらに進んで中枢資本の相互浸透への，資本輸出の主要力点の明らかな転移は，発達した資本の再生産における技術的な諸変化，価値に即した諸変化を反映している。なるほど，周辺において個々の経済部門における利潤率は，中枢におけるよりも高くなりうるであろうが，けれども通常の場合，期待しうる利潤量が中枢資本の蓄積欲求にとって不十分なのである。一般に，この点で若干の例外といわねばならないのは原料生産地域である。原料生産地域は，とりわけ，その使用価値的性格を理由にして資本輸出の優先的対象だからである。必要な原料の確保のために，これらセクターは極端に強く外国資本によって支配され，十分収益のあがる原料資源の搾取のために，採取業においては高度な技術工学的水準で生産されるので，このセクターにおいては，海外投資による収益性がメトロポーレン中枢におけるそれに比肩しうるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"积累过程的停滞表现为资本过剩产生。即资本处于闲置状态。 “在任何情况下，旧资本的部分闲置都是不可避免的。这是资本作为资本功能并需要价值增殖的属性的闲置。竞争将决定哪部分特别受到这种闲置的影响。” 这种过剩资本，即“积累的资本多于被投入生产的资本”的表现，因此这种资本是过剩的，至少利润量不会抵销利润率的趋势性下降。这种过剩资本同时也会产生劳动力的过剩。随着生产力的前进性发展和资本的有机构成的提高，以及需要的最低资本日益增大，一个国家的资本，如果试图保持在自身框架内，则将越来越接近马克思所写的绝对危机点。 不断扩张的资本在其发展进程中为自己创造了世界市场。对一个国家的资本来说，世界市场的创造首先意味着商品出口，目的是实现包含在商品中的剩余价值，这些剩余价值在国境内部生产并被一个国家的资本获得。然而，随着国境内部的剩余价值生产变得不足以支持积累的进一步发展，并且剩余价值生产的基础需要扩大，资本必须被输出以便能以资本的形式发挥作用。 “如果资本被送往国外，那并不是因为资本在本国绝对无法使用。而是因为资本可以在国外以更高的利润率被使用。然而，对就业劳动人口以及对那个国家来说，这种资本绝对是过剩资本。” 资本输出中，“被指定产生剩余价值的价值流出”会扩大一个国家资本的剥削领域，超越国家的限制。不仅仅是一个国家内部生产的剩余价值在该国家边界之外得以实现，而且，这一个国家的资本现在能够利用外国劳动力进行剥削。因此发生剩余价值的集中。而当这种集中在一个国家的资本无法通过其他方式获得其再生产所需的剩余价值量时，这种集中就成为不可避免的。随着资本主义基础上生产力的前进性展开，资本过剩积累的趋势变成长期现象，一个国家的资本越来越放弃国内狭窄的剩余价值生产的限制，必须通过资本输出，以利用外国劳动力的方式进行剥削，这种强制越来越大。 因此，引导一个国家的资本向资本输出导向的，并非抽象的利润率比较，而是具体缺乏足够盈利的国内投资可能性，这使得彻底利用利润率差异并强制将资本输出成为必然。因而，对一个国家的资本来说，越来越多地关注国家保障的主权范围之外具有盈利性的投资地点和条件，与其他各国资本的竞争在各处产生，国家获得对一个国家资本价值增殖利益的对外强大代理人的意义。一个国家的资本不可避免地变得帝国主义化。 引发资本输出的根据是多样的。旧市场被保留或扩大并新征服。这同样适用于原材料来源。具有潜在竞争力的产业，无论是通过直接合资企业还是通过有竞争力资本的直接市场参与和关税壁垒保护，或通过对资本控制的优惠性规定的利用，都可以间接地受到控制。低工资可以作为将生产地点转移到国外的刺激。财政保障也可以作为对增殖价值所需的政治干预发挥作用。 资本输出的形式随着资本再生产基础的变化而历史转变。对于早期帝国主义而言，外债发行作为中介的借贷资本——列宁特别提到了外债发行——是资本输出的主要形式且具有重要性。如今，借贷资本的输出特定于政府和国际机构。私人资本以直接投资的形式出现。这种直接投资是一个国家资本的剥削基础直接扩张的表现。随着固定资本占运营资本比例的上升，价值增殖的技术条件、加速度的道德折旧，以及尖锐的国内、国际竞争成为问题，这些因素使得仅通过倾向于国际化的价值增殖基础来满足高要求，以维持积累。这种国际化伴随着中心地区剩余价值的强烈集中，以及国内和国际层面上进一步积累的资本集聚。 资本输出的物质重点以及由此产生的地域重点是由中心地区资本当时达到的再生產条件决定的。从周边到中心资本之间更深层相互渗透的资本输出主要转移，反映了发达资本再生产中技术变革、价值相关变化。确实，周边地区的单个经济部门的利润率可能高于中心，但通常情况下，预期的利润量对于中心资本的积累要求而言是不足的。一般来说，原料生产区域可说是某种例外，因为其使用价值的特性使得原料生产区域成为资本输出的优先目标。为了确保必需的原材料，这些部门受到外国资本的极端强大控制，为了充分盈利的原材料开采，在采矿业中以高技术工程标准进行生产，因此在这些部门中，海外投资的盈利性可以与中心地区相媲美。"},{"instruction":"请将“しかし，生産過程の科学化によって生産性がますます向上していくのにつれて，そして，総生産物に占める自然原料部分が可能なかぎり大幅に減少することによって不変資本が節約されるにつれて，周辺諸国は高収益性投資の素材的諸条件の側面からもまた，全体として有効性を失う。境界を越えて外延化する資本は，科学を生産過程に強力に合体させることによって高い生産性がそのときそのとき確実にされるような，そして集積の発達した状況が独占的利得を約束し，加えて，相対的によく整備されて機能する網目状のインフラストラクチュア的諸前提が存在しているような，そういう地域へとますます流れこんでいロポーレンく。国際的な資本のからみ合いが中 枢において，ただ単にブルジョア国家の境界線のみならず，ブルジョア国家の形態も桎梏となるような規模に達するのは，まさにこの過程によってである。 I 貿易構造における周辺の位置低下の理由 世界貿易構造は，商品の側面からみても資本輸入-資本輸出の側面からみても，周辺諸国の占める部分が減少し，商品運動-資本運動の中枢間志向が増大するということを示している。中枢の周辺に対する経済的利害関心は歴史的にみて，本質的に原料と農業一次産品に集中していたのであるから，どのようにして，こうした生産物の少なからざる後退が説明されうるのか，ということと，それらは中枢での再生産過程にとって，その後どのような役割を演ずるのかということがまずもって問われるべきであろう。 (257)圧倒的に中枢資本によって統制された原料採掘における生産性の向上と，必要な原料の倹約と合理的充用という形での不変資本の節約とは，完成品一個あ(258)たりの材料集約度の僅少化をもたらしてきた。その際，技術的進歩の方向性はしばしば，必要な第一次製品の高騰ないしは不足によって規定されるのである。このことはとくに，原料の代替にあてはまるのであるが，もちろん，これは代替への素材的可能性が存在する限りでのことであり，直接的採掘が比較的利益があがらなくなったり，あるいは長期にわたる供給が経済的または政治的に危(259)ぶまれるときにはじめて導入されることである。 世界貿易に食糧の占める部分が後退したことは，本質的に，高度に発達した工業諸国において農業の生産性が非常に高まったことのうちに根拠づけられるが，農業保護と農業補助金の相対的に包括的な政策によって一層促進されたの(260)である。このことは，影響の受け方はさまざまとしても，一般に，中枢資本に(261)よって極度に輸出志向に構成された周辺の経済にとって，破壊的な結果をもつ。メトロポーレン独占化され，国際的に組織された中 枢の資本が価格操作に訴えない場合でさえ，需要の縮小とモノカルチュア的過剰生産は価格暴落をもたらすのであり，この価格暴落は国際的な商品協定によっても，ほとんどさえぎることはできなコントロールい。圧倒的に外国資本によって直接統御され，搾取され，高度技術化された生産的な原料採取産業は，相対的な一一部は絶対的な-貧困化経済構造の(262)なかの孤島のように存在する。 国際的な交易において原料と第一次産品の占める部分が全地球的に相対的に減少する-このことはとくに，低開発諸国に該当する-にもかかわらず，若干の分野では需要は変わらないか，あるいはむしろ増大する。これはとくに(263) (264)燃料，とりわけ石油や，鉱物，鉱石に当てはまる。こうしたものは，これまで長期にわたって代替が不可能であるか，あるいは代替に高い費用を要するので，投資財や兵器の生産にとって放棄しえないものなのである。なお，食糧の分野の少なからざる部分にも同様のことがいえる。これら生産物に関して周辺諸国は，世界市場においてしばしば独占的供給者の役割を占めているが，通例，メトロポーレン中枢によって占められた独占的買い手の地位が強力に決定的な地位であることは明らかである。強力な中枢資本が必要な資源を自らの資本で採掘しない場メトロポーレン合には，不等価交換と多大な政治的抑圧が，中 枢に都合のよい価格構造という効果を生ぜしめる。 この分野では，場合によっては中 枢に対して逆転しうるであろうような依メトロポーレン存関係が存在するにもかかわらず，それまで久しく中 枢の資本によって方向づけられた生産諸力の発展の格差にもとづいて，狙いをつけた資本輸出と権力手段の導入は，中枢自体が依存している関係を周辺が依存する関係に逆転させるのに成功してきたのである。 X 中枢-周辺依存関係の選択的方向づけ 総資本の蓄積過程は世界市場が形成されるとともに，そして，搾取された剰余価値量の中枢での集中によって資本主義的搾取が傾向的に国際化するにつれて，真に包括的な蓄積過程になるのであるが，この総資本の蓄積過程は，拡大再生産の進行のなかで，投資財工業（第I部門）の相対的増大化と消費財工業(265)（第II部門）の相対的減少化を推進する。このことが意味するのは，所与の重(266)点的な，中枢への第I部門の集積と周辺への第I部門の割当という点で商品一資本の流れの国際的諸運動に対する相応する諸結果をもって独特に打刻された国際分業である。同時にそれは，資本主義的世界経済システムに組み入れられた全国家の再生産過程が，中枢資本によって多かれ少なかれ修正された形で構造化されたとみなされるべきだ，ということを意味している。”翻译为中文","output":"然而，随着生产过程的科学化使生产力不断提升，以及通过尽可能大幅度减少总产出中自然原料部分以节约不变资本，周辺国家在高收益性投资的物质条件方面也将整体上失去其有效性。跨越边界扩展的资本越来越流向那些通过强力融合科学到生产过程中以确保高生产力，并且累积的发展状态保证了独占性利润，此外，还存在相对完善且功能良好的网状基础设施前提条件的地区。正是通过这一过程，国际资本的交织在中心地区达到了一个规模，不仅仅是资产阶级国家的边界线，甚至资产阶级国家的形态也成为束缚。 I 周边在贸易结构中地位下降的原因 世界贸易结构显示，无论从商品方面还是从资本输入-资本输出方面看，周辺国家所占的比例在减少，而商品流动-资本流动的中心间倾向在增加。从历史上看，中心对周边的经济利益关注本质上集中在原料和农业初级产品上，因此，如何解释这些产品的相当程度的衰退，以及它们在中心的再生产过程中将起到什么样的作用，应首先被提出。 在中心资本主导下的原料开采中生产力的提升，以及通过节约和合理使用必要原料的形式节约不变资本，导致了成品单位材料集约度的降低。在这种情况下，技术进步的方向往往是由必要的初级产品价格上涨或短缺所决定的。这尤其适用于原料的替代，但当然，这是在替代物质可能性存在的限度内，并且只有在直接开采变得相对不那么有利或长远供应在经济或政治上受到威胁时才引入。 世界贸易中粮食所占部分后退的根本原因是高度发达的工业国家中农业生产力的极大提升，这一点通过相对全面的农业保护和补贴政策进一步促进。这对于被中心资本极度定向为出口的周边经济来说，尽管影响各不相同，总的来说，这将具有破坏性的结果。即使在中心国际组织化的资本没有诉诸于价格操纵的情况下，需求的减少和单一作物的过度生产也会导致价格暴跌，而这种价格暴跌几乎无法通过国际商品协议来阻止。被外国资本直接控制和剥削、高度技术化的生产性原料开采产业，就像孤岛一样存在于相对的——部分是绝对的——贫困经济结构中。 尽管原料和初级产品在全球范围内所占比例相对减少——这尤其适用于低发展国家——在某些领域需求保持不变或甚至增加。这尤其适用于燃料，特别是石油，以及矿物和矿石。长期以来，这些因为无法替代或替代成本高昂，因此对于投资品或武器生产是不可或缺的。在粮食领域的相当一部分也适用同样的情况。对于这些产品，周边国家在世界市场上经常扮演独占性供应者的角色，但通常情况下，中心资本占据的独占性买家地位明显具有决定性。强大的中心资本如果不直接以自己的资本开采所需资源，不等价交换和大量的政治压迫会产生对中心有利的价格构造效果。 即使存在可能对中心造成逆转的依赖关系，基于长期以来由中心资本定向的生产力发展差异，目标明确的资本输出和权力手段的引入已成功使中心本身依赖的关系逆转为周边依赖的关系。 X 中心-周边依赖关系的选择性定向 随着世界市场的形成和在中心地区剩余价值量的集中导致资本主义剥削趋势性地国际化，总资本的累积过程成为一个真正包容性的累积过程，但这个总资本的累积过程，在扩大再生产的进行中，推动了投资品工业（第一部门）的相对增长和消费品工业（第二部门）的相对减少。这意味着，国际商品和资本流动的相应结果以独特的方式标记了中心对第一部门的集中和对周边的第一部门的分配的国际分工。同时，这意味着被纳入资本主义世界经济体系的所有国家的再生产过程，在很大程度上被中心资本修正后的形式结构化。"},{"instruction":"请将“中枢における本源的蓄積とひきっづく生産諸力の展開以来，周辺諸国家は，既存の生産構造を中枢資本の欲求に役立つようにした国際分業連関に組み入れられてきた。そのさい，周辺経済のなかでひとつの転換が歴史的に追求されるメトロポーレンべきである。すなわち，中 枢の側からする公然たる略奪から，原料採掘と第一次産品の生産を経て，軽工業と部分的には，そして傾向として投資財生産に至る転換である。周辺経済の発展の各段階は中枢資本の蓄積における発展段階と符合し，そしてまた，それによって規定される。おのおのの段階はまた，前資本主義的生産様式の部分的破壊が一歩一歩すすんでいったことをも意味する。-「余剰の交換は，交換を措定し，また交換価値を措定する交易である」，すなわち，前資本主義的に生産された剰余生産物の搾取から，中枢資本に従属し，中枢資本によって直接，間接に同時に主導されつつ搾取される本源的蓄積ならびに持続的蓄積への移行である。 したがって，周辺経済は中枢における資本の拡大に依存している。周辺経済の低開発は，中枢資本の展開の直接的な構成部分なのである。依存の諸形態は，生産諸力の発展とともに変化する中枢資本の価値増殖欲求の程度と，国際分業構造への中枢資本の諸要請とに応じて歴史的に変化してきている。直接的に植民地的な従属から財政的-産業上の従属，そして結局，技術工学的-産業上の従属へという歴史的過程が-たとえ実際には混在形態においてであったり，並立して現われたりするにしても-観察される。それに照応して，周辺経済の発展は絶対的に前進する。とはいえ，この絶対的前進は，世界レヴェルでの全社会的富で測れば相対的なものになる。この前進は周辺における住民大衆の増大する貧困化とともに現われる。中枢諸国での剩余価値の集中は，周辺諸国コムプラドールにおいて民族的買 弁レジームに媒介される搾取や，あるいは直接外国による搾取といった多様な形態として貫徹されるが，この集中は第三世界の住民大衆にふりかかる。一方，買弁ブルジョアジーという非常に脆弱な階級が中枢による搾取に関与して，利得を得るのである。 周辺諸国の状況，つまり開花した資本主義的世界市場に完全に統合されることで生産力発展を回復するということは，独特の様式で自らの経済を組み立てる。低い技術工学的水準は，甚大な搾取の諸形態と労働力商品の価格の価値以下への下落とをもたらす。生計の漸進的破壊は，一連の鋭い社会的，政治的コンフリクト デイスパリテート衝突とともに地理上の不平等を生みだす。あまりにも少なすぎる所得形成では，適切な国内市場が発生する余地も，したがってまた「国内主導」の工業化が芽ばえる余地もほとんどない。恒久的な価値移転は十分な蓄積源泉の形成を妨げ，資本は私的あるいは国家による流路を通って外から輸入されねばならない。こうしたことが，歴史的に先立っていた固有の経済の外部からの構造化を深め，加えて負債の増大をもたらすのである。そこで輸入にとってかわることをめざして工業化が遂行され，そのことが外的に規定された輸出志向状況への編み込みからの自己解放のために告示されるが，それは通例，従属を尖鋭化させるだけである。なぜなら，必要な独自の諸資源を欠いているからである。工業化過程が開始されるかぎり，このことはつりあわないほど発展した工業技術を導入して行なわれるが，こうした技術はかなり多くの労働力を，吸収するよりもむしろ放り出すのであり，そのことによって，持続的人口増加にあっては，マージナリテイ経済的限 界状況に陥いる住民部分は減少するよりもむしろ増加する。実際，Importsubstitution 輸入にとってかわる工業化がなされる場合，それは大部分，外国の資本によってコントロールされたままであり，かつまた，その構造において強く買弁ブルジョアジーの消費欲求に方向が合わせられるのである。この両者は中枢への技術上の従属を強める。結局，周辺諸国の民族ブルジョアジーはより高く，より安全な収益性という理由から，自己の資本を優先的に中枢資本の企業や銀行に投資するので，そしてしばしば，競争力のありうる分野は中枢諸国の関税措置や輸入割当措置によって制限されているので，周辺諸国が一国的蓄積と生産力発展をなすチャンスは乏しいままなのである。 資本主義が中枢諸国から出発し，世界的な拡がりをみせ，その拡大が技術的，社会的にずっと遅れた地域を歴史からみて複雑な形で直撃するということ，ならびに，歴史的には他の潜在的発展可能性をひめた地域で経済的·政治的抑圧によって，特殊なセクターが選択的かつ，中枢によりコントロールされたかたちで発展するということ，こうしたことは，周辺諸国において，ちょうどラテンーアメリカの発展についての論争で「構造的異質性」と特徴づけられたような状況を生みだす。したがって，かの生産一支配諸関係と生産力発展の不均等な状態が由来するところ，それは，なるほど資本主義は世界市場を創出したし，そうして世界市場に絡み合わされたすべての国の経済を規定してはいるけれども，すべての生産領域を貫通し，現実におしなべて資本主義化することはできトロポーレンないということであると解釈される。中 枢において集積された資本には，剰余価値率の維持·向上のための周辺諸国の搾取と，さらに資本拡大が前進するための周辺諸国の貫通的資本主義化とのあいだの矛盾を自力で，そして，長期にわたって解決するのに十分な剰余価値を生産することはできないのである。 周辺諸国における経済発展の限界線は中枢自体によって線引きされているが，増大する資本集積-集中において，生産の科学化によってますます駆りたてられる中枢資本の蓄積過程は，周辺諸国の工業化への利害関心-個々の資本グループ間で一部矛盾する-を助長する。”翻译为中文","output":"自中心地区的原始积累和随之而来的生产力展开以来，周辺国家被纳入服务于中心资本欲求的国际分工关系中，现有的生产结构被调整以适应。在这过程中，周边经济中应该被历史性地追求的转变之一就是，从中心侧公然的掠夺转变为经由原材料开采和初级产品生产，进而部分并趋向于投资品生产的转变。周边经济的发展的各个阶段与中心资本的积累发展阶段相一致，并由此来定义。每个阶段也意味着前资本主义生产方式的部分破坏逐步进行。“剩余的交换，即设定交换和交换价值的贸易，”就是从前资本主义生产的剩余产品的剥削，转向原始积累和持续积累，这是由中心资本直接和间接地同时引导的过程。 因此，周边经济依赖于中心地区资本的扩张。周边经济的不发达是中心资本展开的直接组成部分。依赖的形式随着中心资本的价值增殖欲望程度和对国际分工结构的各种要求随着生产力的发展而历史性地变化。从直接的殖民地依附到财政-工业依附，最终到技术工程-工业依附的历史过程——即使实际上可能以混合形态出现或并行出现——被观察到。相应地，周边经济的发展是绝对向前推进的。然而，这种绝对前进，如果以全球层面的社会总财富来衡量，则是相对的。这种进步伴随着周边居民大众贫困化的增长出现。中心国家的剩余价值集中以各种形式贯彻，如周边国家的买办中介引导的剥削或直接外国剥削，这种集中落在第三世界居民身上。另一方面，非常脆弱的买办资产阶级参与中心的剥削以获取利润。 周边国家的情境，即通过完全融入成熟的资本主义世界市场来恢复生产力发展，表现为以一种独特的方式构建自己的经济。低技术工程水平导致剧烈剥削形式和劳动力商品价格低于其价值。生计的逐渐破坏产生地理上的不平等，伴随一系列尖锐的社会、政治冲突。过于有限的收入形成几乎不留下发展适当国内市场的空间，因此也几乎没有“国内主导”工业化的空间。持续的价值转移阻碍了充分积累源泉的形成，资本必须通过私人或国家通道从外部引入。这进一步加深了先前存在的经济的外部结构化，并导致债务增加。工业化被实施以代替进口，这被宣布为自我解放于外部定义的出口导向环境的目的，但通常这只会加剧依附，因为缺乏必要的本地资源。只要工业化过程开始，它就是通过引入不成比例发展的工业技术来进行的，这些技术往往排放而非吸纳更多劳动力，从而在持续人口增长中，越来越多的居民部分陷入经济边缘状况而非减少。实际上，当进行替代进口的工业化时，它大多仍受外国资本控制，并且在其结构上强烈地针对买办资产阶级的消费欲望。这两者加强了对中心技术依赖。最终，周边国家的民族资产阶级因更高、更安全的收益性，优先将自己的资本投资于中心资本的企业和银行，而且往往可能的竞争领域被中心国家的关税措施或进口配额措施限制，使得周边国家在国家级积累和生产力发展的机会依然稀缺。 资本主义从中心国家出发，在全球扩散，并且其扩张直接以技术和社会上相对落后地区以历史上复杂的形式接触，以及通过经济和政治压迫在其他潜在发展可能性的地区选择性、受中心控制地发展某些特定领域，这些情况在周边国家产生了被称为“结构性异质性”的情境，如同针对拉丁美洲发展的争论。因此，生产和支配关系以及生产力发展的不均衡状态的来源，在这点上可以解释为，确实资本主义创造了世界市场并决定了所有纳入其中的国家的经济，但它无法穿透所有生产区域，在现实中使之普遍资本主义化。在中心地区积累的资本无法自行且长期解决周边国家的剥削与进一步资本主义化之间的矛盾，以维持或提升剩余价值率。 周边国家的经济发展界限是由中心自己划定的，但随着资本集聚-集中的增加，在中心资本的积累过程中被生产的科学化日益推动，加剧了对周边国家工业化的利益关注——即使个别资本集团之间部分矛盾。"},{"instruction":"请将“拡大する資本にとって，自らひいた限界線が障害になるのである。急速かつ根底的な周辺諸国の工業化への利害関心は多様に動機づけられる。ただ単に，一般的に購買力が大きくなり，それゆえ，より多く輸出されうるというだけではない。中枢資本によってコントロールされ，中枢資本の価値増殖という至上トロポーレン命令に従わされた周辺での蓄積でもって，中枢はまた国際的分業を自らの蓄積傾向と蓄積条件に適合的に，効果的に構造化したり，周辺での剰余価値生産に有利に関与したりできるのである。国際的分業の所与の型の再組織化ということは，もちろん中枢のさまざまな資本グループ間の相対立する利害のなかで，特殊な生産物が先進的な技術的発達という諸条件のもとでも十分大量かつ安価に製造されえない場合，つまり，それらを周辺諸国に移しかえることが資本の価値増殖の立場から可能と思われる場合，またさらに，周辺からの輸入が価格の国際的操作と不等価交換によって一層利益があがる場合，いたるところに存在する。輸出集約的資本の大部分にとっては，周辺の工業化は機械の迅速な道徳的磨耗の作用を一定期間回避する可能性を提供する。つまり中枢においてはもはや完全に競争力を失った投資財が，周辺諸国への輸出を目的としてひきっづいて生産されうるし，すでに生産されたがもはや売却しえないような，あるいは使用されつくした生産手段が依然として有利に売られうるし，またあるいは，自ら経営にのりだし，当地の有利な賃金·立地条件のもとで，それら生産手段がなお資本価値増殖的に機能しうるのである。このことはとくに，素材的理由から，あるいは必要な資本調達の理由から，傾向として一連の高度に技術化された成長産業から脱落する資本にとって意義がある。 それゆえ，中枢資本は周辺の工業化に利益関心をもつし，それを必要とする。(276)周辺における工業化は商品輸出ならびに商品輸入の面から必然的である。つまり，中枢諸国における資本の価値増殖欲求は，周辺諸国を切り捨てえない参与(277)者にするというやり方で，国際的分業を構造化し，再組織する。同時に，資本の有機的構成の増大と調達すべき資本ミニマムの上昇に直面して，粗放的搾取諸形態は不十分になり障害になるという形で，周辺諸国は蓄積源泉として，意(278)義を獲得する。中枢における競争力の劣る資本ばかりか，独占的な資本輸出によって直接拡大していく資本もまた，そしてそういう資本だからこそ，生産諸力の発展を促すことによって周辺での相対的剰余価値生産それ自体の持続的上(279)昇を必要とする。というのは，旧式の植民地的搾取諸形態，つまり絶対的剰余価値の搾取では，あまりにも乏しい剰余価値量しか生まないので不十分になってしまっているからである。工業化の不足とあまりにゆっくりした国内市場の成長は，周辺諸国に蓄積源泉として，販売市場として付与される意義と矛盾する。だから，中枢資本は周辺諸国に対して，選択的に，従属した蓄積過程を許すことを強いられる。もちろん，その方向性は国内市場にむけられるものではなく，外国向けに構造化されたままであり，いわば中枢の蓄積過程の外郭であ(280)り付録なのである。 選択性は，従属的蓄積を必要とさせるのと同じ原因，すなわち剰余価値の不足ということに根拠をもっている。私的資本はそのもっとも強力な独占的代表者たちにおいてさえ，独力で，自らつくりだした鋭い不均衡構造を克服して十分に相対的剰余価値を生む工業化過程を作動させることができない。通例，補imperialistische 助的方策，あるいは保証的方策が必要であるが，いずれにしても帝国主義的Nationen 諸国の国家装置の準備活動，補完活動が必要である。 いわゆる開発援助は，資本拡大が必要であることと，けれども資本によって独力で資本拡大を果しえないこととの間の矛盾の一表現である。開発援助は収益性のある投資のインフラストラクチュア的諸前提の建設を促進することによって，客観的に低発展諸国のための援助ではなく，中枢の私的資本のための援助である。こうした援助は，直接投資にたちはだかる障害を除去し，計画された個別方策のなかで，とくにまたより勢力の小さい諸資本の生産の海外進出を支え，そうして，中枢諸国において燃えあがる階級闘争を防ぐことに寄与する。開発援助をたすけとして，帝国主義諸国家は国際的分業の再構造化を強行し，そうして，自らの勢力圏の新植民地主義的統合を確実なものとするのである。 従属的蓄積の選択は結局，中枢諸国における相対的資本過剰と，周辺諸国で生産諸力を完全に展開させるのに必要な資本支出という点からみれば相対的，絶対的な資本不足ということとの間の矛盾から根拠づけられる。社会的，地域的，経済的に好都合な諸前提をそなえた国家が選択されるのであり，ここでも再び若干の分野だけが選択される。しかしとりわけ，従属的蓄積は極端に抑圧的諸条件のもとでおこなわれる。できるかぎり支障のない賃労働の搾取のためには，賃労働者と最低生活水準のぎりぎりのところで生活している自営業者の(287)諸組織の暴力的紛砕と抑圧，ならびにあらゆる反対運動の抑圧が必要でるあ。基底的には帝国主義諸国家の資本に由来する，こういう暴力を媒介する位置を(288)占めるのは，通常，周辺諸国における買弁ブルジョアジーである。経済的に中枢資本と一層すすんだ利害同一性をもって，文化的には自国の民衆からの疎外(289)のなかで，買弁ブルジョアジーが，まさに中枢資本によって優先的に選ばれて資本拡大された周辺諸国において独裁的軍事政権を樹立するということは偶然ではない。 買弁政府が資本家的暴力の抑圧的窓口として機能することができない場合，中枢諸国の資本には最後の手段として，政治的·軍事的介入という形での直接的暴力の道具がのこされている。この政治的，軍事的介入は資本の際限のない価値増殖衝動と不十分な剰余価値生産との間の，潜在的にはつねに暴力を内包している矛盾の公然たる表現である。換言すれば，それは世界的規模での資本の危機の政治-軍事的な自己告白なのである。 ”翻译为中文","output":"对于扩大的资本而言，自己划定的界限成为障碍。对于周边国家的迅速和根本性的工业化的利益关注是多样化的动机所驱动的，并不仅仅是因为一般购买力的增大使得可以出口更多。通过在周边的积累，这是由中心资本控制并服从于中心资本的价值增殖的最高命令，中心能够再次将国际分工结构化以适合自己的积累倾向和条件，或有利地参与周边的剩余价值生产。国际分工的给定模式的重组意味着，在中心的各种资本集团之间相对立的利益之中，特定产品在先进的技术发展条件下无法被大量且廉价地制造的情况下，即将这些转移到周边国家对于资本的价值增殖来说被视为可能，或者进口自周边的情况下通过国际价格操纵和不平等交换而获得更大利益的情况无处不在。对于大部分出口密集型资本来说，周边的工业化提供了一种可能性，即在一段时间内避免中心机械的快速道德磨损的作用，即那些在中心已经完全失去竞争力的投资品仍可以为了出口到周边国家而生产，已经生产但无法再销售的或已经耗尽使用的生产手段仍然可以有利销售，或者在当地有利的工资和地理条件下启动经营，这些生产手段仍可以具有资本价值增殖的功能。这对于那些因物质原因或必要的资本募集原因而趋向于从一系列高度技术化的成长产业中脱落的资本尤其有意义。 因此，中心资本对周边的工业化有利益关注并且需要它。周边的工业化在商品出口和进口方面是必然的。即，中心国家对资本价值增殖的欲望通过将周边国家变成无法割舍的参与者的方式来结构化和重新组织国际分工。同时，面对必要的最低资本额上升和资本的有机构成增加，粗放的剥削形式变得不足以成为障碍，周边国家因此获得了作为积累源泉的意义。不仅是竞争力较弱的资本，而且通过垄断性资本输出直接扩张的资本也需要，尤其是这些资本，因为它们通过促进生产力的发展来需要周边持续上升的相对剩余价值生产本身。因为旧式的殖民地剥削形式，即绝对剩余价值的剥削，已经变得不足以产生过少的剩余价值量。工业化的缺乏和国内市场过于缓慢的增长与作为积累源泉和作为销售市场赋予周边国家的意义相矛盾。因此，中心资本被迫选择性地允许周边国家进行从属的积累过程。当然，这种方向性不是针对国内市场，而是保持针对外国市场结构化的，可以说是中心的积累过程的外围和附录。 选择性基于从属的积累所需的同一原因，即剩余价值的不足。即使是最有力的垄断性代表者，私人资本也无法单独通过不平衡结构来产生足够的相对剩余价值的工业化过程。通常需要辅助性或保障性措施，无论如何，需要帝国主义国家的国家机构的准备和补充活动。 所谓的发展援助是资本扩张所必需的与资本无法单独实现扩张之间矛盾的一个表现。开发援助通过促进投资的基础设施前提的建设客观上不是为低发展国家的利益，而是为中心的私人资本的利益。这种援助通过去除直接投资面临的障碍，在计划的个别策略中，特别是支持较小势力的资本的海外生产扩展，并帮助防止在中心国家爆发的阶级斗争。借助发展援助，帝国主义国家强行重新构造国际分工，从而确保其势力范围的新殖民主义整合。

如果买办政府无法作为资本家暴力的压迫性通道功能，那么中心国家的资本最后手段是政治和军事干预的直接暴力形式。这种政治和军事干预公开表现为无限制的资本价值增殖冲动与不足的剩余价值生产之间潜在的始终包含暴力的矛盾。换言之，这是全球范围内资本危机的政治-军事自白。"},{"instruction":"请将“XI 蓄積の国際化と国家の矛盾 メトロポーレン世界的規模での資本の拡大は，国際的な商品-資本の流れの中 枢への一層メトロポーレンの集積によって随伴される。このことの根拠は中 枢における資本の再生産諸条件の変化のうちに求められるべきである。生産諸力の発展の到達段階に基づトロポーレンいて，中 枢において集中された総資本は資本の価値増殖を保証する相対的剰余価値生産を維持するために，生産過程への科学の絶えまない結合を必要とする。拡大再生産ないし継続的蓄積は必然的に生産財工業（第I部門）の相対的増大とともにあらわれるので，相対的剰余価値生産の重点はますます中枢諸国に移される。ここでは生産過程の科学化が，競争に必要な調査と開発のために，あるいは見通しのきく投資計画のために供せられるべき資本支出への要請を高くするのであり，その結果，価値増殖諸条件の変化から，資本の集積-集中への尖鋭化された強制が生じるのである。ただ強度に独占化された資本だけがなお，有利な価値増殖条件，販売条件をめぐる競争戦において生きのびることができる。「世界市場での競争戦においては今日，新しい科学的·技術的方法の開発デイナミークと導入に際してもっとも大きな力を展開しうる独占が最強である。このための可能性は，独占的地位の基礎としてのコンツェルンの集積と集中の度合にかかっている。なぜならば，この度合が独占の利潤率·量の大きさにとって決定的だからである」。 そのさい，一国的限界は蓄積基盤の拡大にとってとっくに狭すぎるものになってしまっている。集積-集中が国際的諸次元に到達した結果，世界市場もまた，独占主義的競争諸形態によって特色づけられ，それがまたふたたび，必然的に集積-集中過程をよびおこす。独占主義的世界市場競争は搾取諸関係の不断の再組織の形態を決定的に規定し，逆にまた，競争の諸形態は蓄積過程の現実的経緯に応じて，その不均等性のなかで変化する。 一国資本の立場からみれば，国際的集積は資本輸出という形態で生じる。さしあたって資本は，自らの作動領域を商品輸出によって拡大する。生産過程が到達した生産力発展の段階が進んだものであればあるほど，そして商品の販売が，とくに投資財の販売だが消費財の販売もまた，一層発展した技術的-文明化的基準を前提していればいるほど，ますます交換は中枢諸国へ集積され，それら商品が中枢諸国の市場を相互に貫通するようになる。 商品交換が一定の強度に達してからは，資本輸出を通じて市場参加することによって市場を保全すること，そして拡張することが必要となる。加えて，販売コストの節約，立地条件の有利性，そして税，賃金に関する相違，景気変動そして通貨のインフレ化，こうしたことは利潤があがるように利用されうる。それにもかかわらず依然として決定的なのは，そのときの生産の技術水準と，それに係っているチャンス，つまり，新たに征服された領域でただ単に剰余価値量のみならず剰余価値率をも高めうるチャンスとである。したがって中枢資グレード本の輸出は，相対的に高い調査·開発の度合によって生産構造が特色づけられている中枢の成長産業へ集中される。 中枢の相互貫通は資本輸出を手段として，国際的な結合をますます増大させるが，こうした結合はそれ自体で，一国的にも国際的にも資本の集積-集中を強める作用を及ぼし，そうしてあらためて結合過程を開始させる。市場の国際化に生産の国際化が傾向として続く。こういう構造を特徴づける表現が多国籍デイメンジオーンコンツェルンである。その計算と計画は国際的レヴェルで国際的次元でなされ，通常，相対的に複雑な国際的に散らばったひとつの生産構造に関連させられている。多国籍コンツェルンのなかで資本は，一国的境界を成果ゆたかに突破する大組織系統を達成するのである。資本は，自らが作動している領域内に位置する諸国家の行動範囲をいちじるしく狭めること，ないしは法的諸規範にいたるまでの決定因を置くことを可能にする可動性と力とを獲得する。国際シュタムジッツ的独占資本は自分に都合のよい会社法に応じて本 国を選択し，融通を効かせて，各国の資本市場を利用する。こういう資本は自らの価値増殖利害関心にだけ方向づけられながら，一国的構造政策的諸決定と経済的施策に影響を及ぽしたり，あるいはそれをさえぎったりしうるのである。国際的独占資本は自分自身の支配領域のなかで，ひとつの重層的分業をつくりだし，この重層的分業が国際的分業構造を打刻する作用を及ぼす。尖鋭化された，世界的拡がりをもった競争の諸条件のもとで活動する国際的規模の巨大な資本統一体の形成とともに，国際的分業は深部にまで達し，国際的専門化と協働が速度をまして進み，それゆえ，国際的経済的結合が強められるのである。 蓄積過程の国際化につれて搾取はますますはっきりと国際的に規定されながら，しかしなお広範囲に一国的に媒介されるので，国際的な競争諸条件と生産諸力差は未曽有の規模で，一国的生産-労働過程のそれぞれの方向を構造化し，そしてまた，製品改良や科学的に媒介された資本引揚げといったレヴェルでの生産の科学化の特殊な諸形態への集中を構造化する。同時にまたそれらは，国家のインフラストラクチュア-科学政策の，そのときそのときの優先序列と活動方向を構造化する。 生産の国際化-そのもっとも進んだ経済的表現が多国籍コンツェルンである-は，境界をもった一国的統一体群の体系としての世界市場という組織化と矛盾している。資本の価値増殖基盤がとっくに一国的枠組を放棄してしまい，一国的国家装置の権能と有効範囲が独占主義的国際資本の欲求にとって不十分であることがあきらかになっている一方，国家装置はますます経済的再生産過程にひきこまれる。とくになによりも重要なのは，生産の国際化と革新によって尖鋭化した国際的競争とから結果する独占資本の欲求に関してである。国家は研究-開発費用の一部をひきうけたり，世界市場競争によって圧し潰されそうになっている資本を補償して支えたりする。国家は自らを集積-集中過程の担い手，推進者にするが，それは資本が自分では果しえないことであるからであり，しかしながら国際的分業と独占主義的世界市場競争という文脈において必要なことだからである。そして，国家自体は，ヨーロッパ経済共同体における場合のように，資本が国際化された価値増殖諸条件の土台のうえにたって必要とする超一国的政治形態の新形成エージェントなのである。しかし，もちろんそれは増大する蓄積の国際化と，蓄積過程への国家のますます危機的に条件づけられた編入との間の矛盾を解決することはできないのである。

随着资本在全球范围内的扩张，伴随而来的是更多资本向中心的集聚。这一现象的根据应在中心资本再生产条件的变化中寻找。基于生产力发展的达到阶段，集中在中心的总资本为了维持保证资本价值增殖的相对剩余价值生产，需要不断地将科学与生产过程结合起来。扩大再生产或持续积累必然表现为生产资料工业（第一部门）的相对增大，相对剩余价值生产的重点越来越多地转移到中心国家。这里，生产过程的科学化提高了对必要的资本支出的需求，用于必要的研究与开发或为了前瞻性投资计划，并由此导致了资本集聚-集中的尖锐化强制。只有高度垄断化的资本才能在围绕有利的价值增殖条件和销售条件的竞争战争中生存下来。“在世界市场的竞争中，今天展现出最大力量的垄断者是那些能够开发和引入新的科学技术方法的。这种能力取决于作为垄断利润率和量的基础的集团集聚和集中的程度，因为这一程度对垄断的利润率和量至关重要。” 此时，国内的界限对于扩大的积累基础而言已经变得过于狭窄。集聚-集中达到国际维度的结果是，世界市场也被垄断主义竞争方式所特征化，并且这反过来又必然引发集聚-集中过程。垄断主义的世界市场竞争决定性地规定了剥削关系的不断重组形式，并且反之，竞争形式随着积累过程的实际进程在其不平等性中变化。 从一个国家资本的立场来看，国际集聚以资本输出的形式发生。首先，资本通过商品出口扩大其操作领域。随着生产过程达到的生产力发展阶段越发进步，并且商品销售——特别是生产资料销售，但消费品销售也是如此——越来越多地以更发达的技术-文明标准为前提，交换越来越多地集中在中心国家，并且这些商品越来越多地相互贯穿中心国家市场。 当商品交换达到一定程度时，通过资本输出参与市场以维持和扩大市场变得必要。此外，节省销售成本，立地条件的有利性，税收、工资差异，经济波动和货币通货膨胀等因素可以被利用以增加利润。尽管如此，仍然决定性的是当时的生产技术水平和相关机会，即在新征服的领域不仅提高剩余价值量而且还能提高剩余价值率的机会。因此，中心资本的输出越来越集中在以相对较高的研发程度特征化的中心成长产业中。 中心的互通使资本输出成为一种手段，增加了国际联结，这种联结本身就强化了资本集聚-集中的作用，并进而再次启动联结过程。市场的国际化随之而来的是生产的国际化。多国公司作为这种结构的典型表现。它们的计算和规划在国际层面上进行，并通常与相对复杂的国际分散的生产结构相关联。在多国公司内部，资本实现了超越单一国家界限的大型组织体系。资本获得了在其活动领域内所在国家的行动范围大幅缩小，甚至在法律规范等决定因素上的可动性和力量。国际性的垄断资本根据自己所需的公司法选择本国，并灵活地利用各国的资本市场。这种资本在定位仅仅受自己的价值增殖利益关系影响的同时，能够影响或阻碍单一国家的结构性政策决定和经济措施。国际垄断资本在其控制领域内创造了一个分层的分工，这对国际分工结构产生了标志性的影响。随着在尖锐化的、具有全球扩展的竞争条件下运作的国际规模巨大的资本统一体的形成，国际分工达到了更深层次，并且国际专业化和协作加速进行，因此加强了国际经济联系。 随着积累过程的国际化，剥削越来越明显地在国际上定义，但仍在广泛范围内通过单一国家进行中介，国际竞争条件和生产力差异在前所未有的规模上构造了各个单一国家的生产-劳动过程的方向，并且还构造了生产的科学化的特殊形态，如产品改善或以科学为媒介的资本撤退等级上的集中。同时，它们还构造了国家基础设施-科学政策的当前优先级和活动方向。 生产的国际化——其最先进的经济表现形式为多国公司——与作为有界单一国家体系的世界市场的组织化相矛盾。当资本的价值增殖基础早已抛弃单一国家框架，单一国家机构的功能和有效范围对于垄断性国际资本的需求显得不足时，国家机构被越来越多地卷入经济再生产过程中。特别是与生产的国际化和革新加剧的国际竞争造成的垄断资本需求相关，国家变得尤其重要。国家承担研究开发费用的一部分，补偿和支持那些在世界市场竞争中可能被压垮的资本。国家将自己变成积累-集中过程的承担者和推动者，因为这是资本无法自行完成的事情，但在国际分工和垄断主义世界市场竞争的背景下，这是必要的。同时，国家本身，如欧洲经济共同体的情况一样，变成了资本在国际化的价值增殖条件基础上所需的超国家政治形态的新形成的代理人。但是，当然这并不能解决增长的积累国际化与国家对积累过程越来越危机性地条件化的融入之间的矛盾。"},{"instruction":"请将“A ブルジョア国家の論理構成 1 国家規定-国家と国家装置 マルクスは，周知のように国家に関して書物を著わす計画をもっていたが，しかしながら書くことはできなかった。マルクスは初期の仕事で，ヘーゲルの法哲学やそのフランス革命に関する議論との関連で国家問題について論及しているが，それを別にするならば，基本的には『フランスの階級闘争』，『ブリューメル18日』さらに『フランスの内乱』という政治的主著の中でのみ国家に取り組んでいるにすぎない。これらのテキストをより正確に考察してみるならば，マルクスは，より厳密にいえば，国家についてではなく国家装置について論述していることがはっきりしてくる。 ところでエンゲルスは次のように述べているのであるが，その場合，国家と国家装置の両概念を同一視している。 「階級対立のかたちをとって運動してきたこれまでの社会には，国家が必要であった。つまり，そのときどきの搾取階級が自分たちの外的な生産諸条件を維持するための，したがって，とくに現存の生産様式によって規定される抑圧の諸条件（奴隷制，農奴制または隷農制，賃労働）のもとに被搾取階級を力ずくで抑えておくための組織が必要であった」。ここでは国家は一つの装置として，エンゲルスの言葉によれば，一つの「機関」〔Körperschaft〕として論じられている。 マルクスは『フランスの内乱』の中で，この国家装置の生成についてつぎのように粗描している。「いたるところにゆきわたった複雑な軍事的，官僚的，教権的，司法的諸機関をもつ中央集権的な国家機構は，生きた市民社会にうわばみのように巻きついているが，これははじめ絶対君主制の時代に生まれかけていた近代社会が封建制度からの解放をめざしてたたかうための武器としてつくりだされた。中世の諸侯や都市や聖職者の領主特権は，統一的な国家権力の属性に変えられ，封建的大官は有給の国家職員とおきかえられ，中世の土地領主の従者たちや都市市民の同職団体から武器がとりあげられて，営備軍に引き渡され，相争う中世的諸権力の雑然たる無政府状態は体系的で階層的な分業にもとづく国家権力の整然たる方式とおきかえられた」。 このような国家装置は，社会的な富の体現としての貨幣が既に普及し，農業が封建時代のような社会的に支配的な生産部門ではもはやなくなったときはじめて確立しえたのである。それに伴って封建階級は社会的に重要な生産要素の処分権能を失い，絶対君主制下においてそうであったように，社会的剰余生産物の単なる横領者·消費者にすぎなくなったのである。このことが封建階級のブルジョアジーに対する決定的な弱点であった。絶対君主制とは，ブルジョアジーが自らの支配を政治的にいまだ樹立していないが，その一方では古い封建階級が社会的な剩余生産物への請求権を国家装置やその下部諸機関，つまり常備軍，警察，国家行政および地方自治行政，裁判所，税制ならびに財政制度などによってもはやかろうじて行使しえていたにすぎない段階の国家形態とみなされうる。 ブルジョア革命は，これまで国家装置の発展を妨げて来た「中世的な残骸，つまり，領主的，貴族的諸特権，都市およびツンフトの独占，そして地方行政諸制度」を終焉させたのである。国家装置はブルジョアジーの階級支配における一つの近代的な手段となったのである。 「近代工業の進歩が資本と労働との階級対立を発展，拡大，深化させるのに応じて，国家権力はますます労働者階級の抑圧のための公的権力，階級支配のための機関としての性格をおびて来た」。 エンゲルスによれば，国家（階級社会もまた同様である）は社会の生産力発展のある一定の段階で登場してくる。 「搾取する階級と搾取される階級，支配する階級と支配される階級とに社会が分裂したのは，それまでは生産の発展が貧弱だったことの必然的帰結であった。社会の総労働が，全員がかつかつ生きてゆくのに必要なものをほんのわずか上まわるだけの生産物しかもたらさないあいだは，したがって，大多数の社会成員の時間の全部またはほとんど全部が労働にとられているあいだは，社会は必然的にいろいろな階級に分かれる。もっぱら労役に服するこの大多数者とならんで，直接の生産的労働から解放された一階級がかたちづくられ，彼らが労働の指揮，国務，司法，科学，芸術などの，社会の共同の業務にあたるのである。だから，階級区分の基礎にあるのは分業の法則である。だが，それだからといって，このような諸階級への区分が暴力や強奪，奸計や欺瞞によって達成されたものではないということにならないし，また，支配階級がひとたびその座にすわったなら，かならず労働する階級を犠牲として自分の支配をかため，社会的指揮を大衆の搾取に変えてきたということを否定するものでもない。」それゆえ，国家は分業の，社会の諸階級への必然的な分裂化の一定の発展段階の産物である。つまり，エンゲルスが述べているように，国家は「けっして外部から社会におしつけられた権力ではない。同様にそれは，ヘーゲルの主張するような，『人倫的理念が現実化したもの』でも『理性が形象化し現実化したもの』でもない。それは，むしろ一定の発展段階における社会の産物なのである。国家は，この社会が自分自身との解決しえない矛盾にまきこまれ，自分では払いのける力のない和解しえない諸対立に分裂したことの告白である。ところで，これらの諸対立，すなわち相対抗する経済的利害をもつ諸階級が無益な闘争のうちに自分自身と社会をほろぼさないためには，外見上（！）社会のうえに立ってこの衝突を緩和し，それを『秩序』の枠の中にたもつべき権力が必要となった。そして，社会からうまれながら社会のうえに立ち，社会にたいしてますます外的なものとなってゆくこの権力が国家である。」 これはエンゲルスの有名な国家規定であり，これがドイツ社会民主党内に多くの混乱をひきおこしてきたところのものである。「国家」は，ドイツにおいては古来一つの定着した理念であるが-少なくともそのようにみえるが——エンゲルスによってもまた，ここで，闘争の渦中に身をおく諸階級の特殊利害を平安と秩序，理性と調停へと呼び戻すために，とくに形成された制度として理解されるのである。 エンゲルスは，上で引用した彼の国家規定を，同じ『家族·私有財産·国家の起源』で次のように書くとき，修正しているのである。 「国家は階級対立を抑制しておく必要から生じたものであるから，しかし同時にこれらの階級の衝突のただなかに生じたものであるから，通例，国家はもっとも勢力のある，経済的に支配する階級の国家である。この階級は国家をもちいて政治的にも支配する階級となり，このようにして，被抑圧階級を抑圧し搾取するための新しい手段を獲得する」。”翻译为中文","output":"XI 资本积累的国际化与国家的矛盾

Python's grammar covers numerous constructs, including expressions, statements, declarations, and more. The Python language's full grammar details are extensive and are formally specified in the Python Language Reference documentation. However, I'll provide you with a simplified illustration of how a subset of Python's grammar can be translated into EBNF. This example will cover some basic elements of Python syntax, such as simple arithmetic expressions and if statements. # Preliminary Note - In EBNF, \`[]\` denotes optional parts, \`{}\` denotes repetition (zero or more times), \`()\` groups elements, \`|\` denotes alternatives, and \`\\"\\"\` or \`''\` are used for literal strings. - This example is simplified and does not cover the full Python grammar or all its nuances. # EBNF for a Subset of Python Grammar Expressions \`\`\` expression ::= term {(\\"+\\"|\\"-\\") term}. term ::= factor {(\\"*\\"|\\"/\\") factor}. factor ::= number | \\"(\\" expression \\")\\". number ::= digit {digit}. digit ::= \\"0\\" | \\"1\\" | \\"2\\" | \\"3\\" | \\"4\\" | \\"5\\" | \\"6\\" | \\"7\\" | \\"8\\" | \\"9\\". \`\`\` If Statement \`\`\` if_statement ::= \\"if\\" expression \\":\\" block [\\"else\\" \\":\\" block]. block ::= statement {statement}. statement ::= if_statement | assignment | expression. assignment ::= identifier \\"=\\" expression. identifier ::= letter {letter | digit}. letter ::= \\"a\\" | ... | \\"z\\" | \\"A\\" | ... | \\"Z\\". \`\`\` Comments and Whitespaces - Comments and whitespaces are typically handled as part of the lexical analysis and aren't usually represented directly in the grammar. # Remarks - This EBNF is a simplified example to demonstrate how Python grammar elements can be represented. - Python's actual grammar includes more sophisticated features like list comprehensions, function and class definitions, exception handling, and more. - The Python Language Reference and PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) are authoritative sources for the complete grammar and its evolution. For the most accurate and detailed description of Python's grammar, consider the official Python documentation and the source code of the Python interpreter itself, specifically the \`Grammar\` and \`Parser\` modules."},{"instruction":"i am gonna provide full python grammar convert that to 'll'","output":"Converting the full Python grammar to LL(1) or any other LL(k) form is a substantial task that involves restructuring the grammar to remove left recursion, left factoring where necessary, and ensuring that it can be parsed in a top-down manner without needing to look ahead more than k symbols, where k is typically 1 for LL(1) grammars. However, given that you'd like an idea of how one might begin to approach converting Python's full grammar into LL(1) form, I'll outline the steps and considerations generally involved in such a process, rather than delving into the complete conversion, which is beyond the scope of a simple response due to the complexity and size of Python's grammar. # Steps to Convert Grammar to LL(1) 1. **Identify and Eliminate Left Recursion**: Python's grammar, like many programming languages, contains left recursive productions. Since LL parsers cannot handle left recursion, you must rewrite these productions to eliminate left recursion. Direct and indirect left recursion must be addressed. 2. **Perform Left Factoring**: If a grammar has alternatives that begin with the same symbol, it would be necessary for an LL(1) parser to look ahead to decide which alternative to use. You would need to factor out the common prefixes of such alternatives to ensure that only a single lookahead is sufficient to make parsing decisions. 3. **Ensure Single Lookahead is Sufficient**: The grammar should be modified such that at each step, looking at the next symbol (for LL(1)) is enough to decide which production rule to apply. This might involve restructuring certain constructs or breaking down complex grammar rules into simpler, non-ambiguous components. 4. **Create Parsing Tables**: For LL(1) grammars, you can create a parsing table that guides the parsing process. Each entry in the table tells the parser which rule to apply based on the current state (non-terminal being expanded) and the lookahead symbol. 5. **Recursion to Iteration for Repetitive Patterns**: In EBNF, constructs like \`{...}\` indicate repetition. These need to be translated into recursive grammar rules for LL(1) parsing but ensuring that they follow the non-left-recursive and lookahead constraints. # Considerations - Python's official grammar is designed more with parsers like LALR in mind (as used by CPython until version 3.9, which switched to a PEG parser). Directly translating such a grammar into LL(1) form isn't straightforward and may not be practical without significant simplification or restructuring. - Python's grammar includes constructs that are inherently difficult or impossible to parse with LL(1) due to ambiguities and syntactic complexities (e.g., significant indentation levels, the same syntax used for different constructs based on context). - The process might lead to a grammar that, while LL(1), is not a faithful representation of Python's full syntax and semantics due to simplifications. Given these challenges, producing a complete LL(1) Python grammar that's both accurate and practical for real-world parsing tasks is a complex undertaking. Such work typically requires iterative refinement and testing against a wide range of Python code samples to ensure correctness and completeness. For learning purposes, focusing on simplified subsets of the language or illustrative examples might be more feasible and still offer valuable insights into LL(1) conversion methodologies."},{"instruction":"# General grammatical elements and rules: # # * Strings with double quotes (\\") denote SOFT KEYWORDS # * Strings with single quotes (') denote KEYWORDS # * Upper case names (NAME) denote tokens in the Grammar/Tokens file # * Rule names starting with \\"invalid_\\" are used for specialized syntax errors # - These rules are NOT used in the first pass of the parser. # - Only if the first pass fails to parse, a second pass including the invalid # rules will be executed. # - If the parser fails in the second phase with a generic syntax error, the # location of the generic failure of the first pass will be used (this avoids # reporting incorrect locations due to the invalid rules). # - The order of the alternatives involving invalid rules matter # (like any rule in PEG). # # Grammar Syntax (see PEP 617 for more information): # # rule_name: expression # Optionally, a type can be included right after the rule name, which # specifies the return type of the C or Python function corresponding to the # rule: # rule_name[return_type]: expression # If the return type is omitted, then a void * is returned in C and an Any in # Python. # e1 e2 # Match e1, then match e2. # e1 | e2 # Match e1 or e2. # The first alternative can also appear on the line after the rule name for # formatting purposes.

The provided grammar is designed for PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) parsers, which naturally handle ambiguities and recursion differently than LL(1) parsers. LL(1) grammars require that for any rule, given the next input token, the parser can unambiguously decide which production to use. This often necessitates removing left recursion, left factoring to resolve ambiguities, and sometimes introducing additional auxiliary rules. The complexity of Python's grammar, with its rich set of features and constructs, makes manual conversion to LL(1) challenging and impractical for a comprehensive response. However, I can guide on how this process might start for a simpler subset of the grammar: expressions involving arithmetic operations. This simplified example aims at giving you an idea of the process and considerations involved. # Given Subset of Python Grammar for Arithmetic Expressions (PEG-like Syntax): \`\`\`plaintext expression: term (('+' | '-') term)* term: factor (('*' | '/') factor)* factor: NUMBER | '(' expression ')' \`\`\` # Steps for Conversion to LL(1): 1. **Eliminate Left Recursion**: The above rules are not left-recursive and do not need this step. However, for other parts of the grammar, you would convert patterns like \`A = A alpha | beta\` to \`A = beta A'\` and \`A' = alpha A' | epsilon\`, where \`epsilon\` represents the empty string. 2. **Left Factoring**: The provided subset does not require left factoring as the choices in each production start with distinct terminals or non-terminals. An example of left factoring if needed would be converting rules like \`A = a beta | a gamma\` to \`A = a A'\` and \`A' = beta | gamma\`. 3. **Create Auxiliary Rules for Repetition**: LL(1) grammars do not natively support repetition operators like \`*\`. Instead, you introduce auxiliary rules to handle this. # Converted Simplified Arithmetic Grammar to LL(1) Style: The original subset is already close to LL(1) compliant but assume we apply step 3 to make it explicit: \`\`\`plaintext expression: term term_tail term_tail: '+' term term_tail | '-' term term_tail | epsilon term: factor factor_tail factor_tail: '*' factor factor_tail | '/' factor factor_tail | epsilon factor: NUMBER | '(' expression ')' \`\`\` Here, \`epsilon\` represents an empty production, which is a way to end the recursion created by \`term_tail\` and \`factor_tail\`. # Remarks: - The conversion of the complete Python grammar would follow a similar pattern but is vastly more involved due to its size, the presence of left recursion in some constructs, more complex features (like list comprehensions, decorators, and error handling), and the requirement to precisely maintain Python's syntax and semantics. - Each construct of Python's grammar (e.g., function definitions, class declarations, compound statements) would require careful treatment to ensure the grammar remains LL(1) and does not introduce ambiguities. - Conversion of grammars to LL(1) is generally done with tool support, like parser generators, which can automate parts of this process for defined grammar subsets. For full language grammars, especially ones as rich as Python's, using parsing approaches that naturally handle these complexities, such as LR, LALR, or PEG, is more common and practical. Converting the entire Python grammar to LL(1) manually not only is impractical but also might result in a less readable and maintainable grammar representation."},{"instruction":"convert python grammar to \`\`\`Grammar = Node* Node = name:'ident' '=' Rule Rule = 'ident' // Alphabetic identifier | 'token_ident' // Single quoted string | Rule* // Concatenation | Rule ('|' Rule)* // Alternation | Rule '?' // Zero or one repetition | Rule '*' // Kleene star | '(' Rule ')' // Grouping | label:'ident' ':' Rule // Labeled rule \`\`\`. no explanation, no constraints, no conclusion, just grammar full.","output":"Given the complexity and the size of the Python grammar provided, fully converting it to the specified grammar format within a single response is impractical.

Typically, there is a \\"high\\" (H) variety used in formal settings such as literature, education, law, and official media. This variant is often standardized, taught in schools, and considered prestigious. Conversely, the \\"low\\" (L) variety is employed in everyday conversation, informal settings, and within the home or community. The L variety is generally not standardized and is acquired as a first language. Both varieties are understood by members of the diglossic community, but their usage is compartmentalized to reflect social functions, not personal preference or proficiency. # Switzerland In Switzerland, the diglossic situation involves Standard German as the H variety and Swiss German dialects as the L variety. - **H Variety**: Standard German is used in formal contexts such as in written communication (newspapers, official documents, literature), in the educational system (teaching language in schools), and in formal speeches. It is the variety that is often required for official interactions and is considered the prestige dialect. - **L Variety**: Swiss German dialects are spoken in everyday situations among family, friends, and in local communities. Each region in Switzerland has its own dialect, making Swiss German very diverse. These dialects are primarily oral, with limited presence in written form, except for some informal texts (text messages, social media). Swiss German is typically the first language Swiss German speakers learn at home. This clear division of contexts and functions makes Switzerland a textbook example of diglossia. # Arabic Speaking Countries The Arab world provides another classic example of diglossia, with Classical Arabic (or Modern Standard Arabic) as the H variety and local dialects as the L varieties. - **H Variety**: Classical Arabic (and its modernized form, Modern Standard Arabic, MSA) is used throughout the Arabic-speaking world in very formal settings, including religious ceremonies (Classical Arabic is the language of the Quran), official speeches, national and international news broadcasts, and education (notably in writing). MSA is the standardized form taught in schools and is necessary for formal written communication. - **L Variety**: The local dialects, such as Moroccan Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, and others, serve as the L varieties. These dialects are spoken in everyday life and vary significantly from region to region, to the extent that some are mutually unintelligible. They are primarily used in colloquial conversations, local media, music, and often in television dramas. Unlike MSA, these dialects are acquired naturally at home and are the first language of speakers in their respective regions. This situation in Arabic-speaking countries exhibits diglossia because of the functional distribution between the high form (Classical/MSA Arabic) used in pan-Arab communications and formal situations, and the local dialects used in daily interactions and cultural expressions. What unites them is a shared literary and cultural reference point in Classical Arabic, alongside the practical usage of local vernaculars for everyday communication."},{"instruction":"provide some less well known examples of diaglossic situations like above, particularly in asia","output":"Diglossia is a global linguistic phenomenon, and Asia, with its rich linguistic tapestry, provides numerous examples of diglossia beyond the well-known cases in Europe and the Arab world. Here are a few less commonly discussed examples from different parts of Asia: # Tamil Nadu, India (Tamil) - **H Variety:** Modern Standard Tamil is used in formal settings such as literature, education (especially higher education), media, and official government communication. It is based on classical Tamil but modernized and standardized. - **L Variety:** Spoken Tamil varieties, which vary significantly from the literary standard and among themselves by region within Tamil Nadu and among Tamil-speaking communities in other parts of the world. Spoken Tamil is used in everyday communication, local media, and is the first language learned at home. The diglossic situation in Tamil Nadu is particularly interesting because the difference between the H and L varieties can be substantial, impacting education and literacy due to the variance in formal and informal language proficiency. # Nepal (Nepali) - **H Variety:** Standard Nepali, based on the Kathmandu Valley speech, is used in formal contexts such as official documents, formal media, and the education system. - **L Variety:** Various regional dialects of Nepali, used in everyday communication among speakers from different parts of the country. These dialects can differ considerably from the standard language in terms of pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. Nepal's situation reflects a scenario where the standard language serves to unify a diverse linguistic landscape while regional dialects preserve local identity and heritage. # Indonesia (Javanese) - **H Variety:** Krama and Krama Inggil are the high varieties of Javanese used in formal situations, for respectful communication (especially to elders or in elevated social contexts), and in traditional Javanese literature. - **L Variety:** Ngoko Javanese is used for informal daily communication among peers, within the family, or when speaking to socially inferior individuals. Diglossia in the Javanese language is governed not only by social context but also by a complex system of social hierarchy and respect. The choice between Ngoko, Krama, and Krama Inggil depends on the social status of the persons involved in the conversation as well as the formality of the situation. # South Korea (Korean) While not traditionally cited as an example of diglossia, South Korea presents an interesting case of stylistic stratification within the same language: - **H Variety:** The formal levels of Korean, including the use of honorifics and formal speech patterns, are used in official settings, formal written communication, news broadcasts, and respectful conversation, especially with people of higher status or older age. - **L Variety:** The informal levels of Korean, including the plain and intimate speech levels, are used among close friends, family, and in informal social media. This variety drops many of the honorifics and uses simpler, more direct forms of speech. This stratification within Korean illustrates how social context and the relationship between speakers can dictate language use, exhibiting characteristics akin to diglossic societies, especially in the precision of social contexts in which different speech levels are appropriate. These examples from Asia showcase the diversity of diglossic situations globally, demonstrating that diglossia can manifest across different domains, from regional dialects and social hierarchies to stylistic variations within a single language based on formality and respect."},{"instruction":"is there one for vietnamese?","output":"The situation of diglossia in Vietnam is somewhat different from classic examples like Arabic-speaking countries or Switzerland but has elements that reflect a diglossic relationship, particularly in terms of historical contexts and variations in formality and function within the Vietnamese language itself. # Vietnamese Vietnamese does not have separate \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" varieties in the strictest sense of diglossia, where two distinctly different forms of a language are used side by side for different functions. However, there are aspects of the language use within the Vietnamese community that reflect diglossic features, especially when considering historical language use, regional dialects, and levels of formality in language: - **Historical Variants:** Historically, Classical Chinese (Hán tự) was used in Vietnam for scholarly, literary, and official administrative purposes, much like Latin in medieval Europe or Classical Arabic in the Arab world. Vietnamese (Nôm), written in a script that was derived from Chinese characters to represent Vietnamese speech, was used for more popular literature and in informal contexts. This historical context reflects a classic diglossic situation which, however, has mostly disappeared with the adoption of the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet (Quốc Ngữ) in the 20th century for all written communication. - **Formality Levels in Modern Vietnamese:** In contemporary Vietnamese, especially in spoken language, there exists a range of register and formality. The formal register (used in official speeches, news broadcasts, and formal presentations) and the informal register (used in everyday conversation, informal media, and entertainment) could be considered as having diglossic functions. The formal register includes the use of more respectful and formal vocabulary and structures, while the informal register is more relaxed and can include slangs and colloquialisms. - **Regional Dialects:** Vietnam has several regional dialects, notably those of the North (centered around Hanoi), Central (Hue), and South (Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon). While all Vietnamese speakers can generally understand these dialects, they can be quite distinct in terms of vocabulary, pronunciation, and even grammatical structure. In some contexts, the use of a particular dialect can signal in-group membership, regional identity, or even social status, although this is more about social and regional variation than a strict H/L diglossia. While modern Vietnamese does not exhibit diglossia in the classic definition, the nuances of formality and the historical layers of language use, including classical scripts for formal and scholarly purposes, reflect a complex linguistic landscape with elements that parallel diglossic situations."},{"instruction":"Перепишите на русском языке предоставленный текст, сохраняя его общий смысл и структуру, но используя: Разнообразную лексику, Перефразирование и переформулирование предложений, Изменение порядка слов и структуры предложений, Улучшение читабельности и удобочитаемости, Сохранение точности и ясности исходного текста.

Ниже представлен простой базовый рецепт маринада для грибов, который подойдёт для шашлыка на мангале. Используйте крупные грибы, такие как шампиньоны или портобелло, поскольку они хорошо держат форму и впитывают ароматы маринада. # Ингредиенты: - 1 кг грибов (например, шампиньонов); - 2-3 зубчика чеснока; - 50 мл соевого соуса; - 50 мл оливкового масла (или подсолнечного); - 1 ст. л. лимонного сока или уксуса; - Специи по вкусу (перец черный молотый, сушеные травы, к примеру, тимьян, розмарин, орегано); - Соль по вкусу. # Инструкция: 1. **Чистка и подготовка грибов:** - Перед приготовлением грибы следует тщательно очистить от грязи, а если нужно, промыть под проточной водой. Крупные шампиньоны можно разрезать пополам. 2. **Приготовление маринада:** - В глубокой миске смешайте оливковое масло (или подсолнечное), соевый соус, выжатый через пресс чеснок, лимонный сок или уксус. Добавьте специи и хорошо перемешайте. 3. **Маринование грибов:** - Грибы поместите в маринад и аккуратно перемешайте, чтобы маринад равномерно покрыл все грибы. Дайте грибам промариноваться в течение 1-2 часов в холодильнике, иногда перемешивая. Для более насыщенного вкуса можно мариновать грибы дольше, до суток. 4. **Жарка на мангале:** - Грибы вынимайте из маринада и нанизывайте на шампуры или специальные гриль-решетки, предварительно смазанные маслом. - Жарьте над углями, периодически поворачивая, до готовности (обычно это занимает около 10-15 минут, в зависимости от размера грибов и интенсивности жара). Полученные маринованные грибы на мангале должны быть ароматными, с лёгкой кислинкой и приятным специфическим вкусом. Они отлично подойдут как самостоятельное блюдо или в качестве гарнира к мясу или рыбе."},{"instruction":"Сократи текст: За время своей истории Нижнекамский химико-технологический институт (НХТИ) стал важной частью регионального научно-образовательного пространства.

Typically, dice ranges reference six-sided dice (d6), twenty-sided dice (d20), or others, but based on the breakpoints in your code (10 for medium size, 16 for large), it seems we're dealing with a scenario likely involving a twenty-sided die (d20) since that's a common dice allowing for values above 16. The logic provided adjusts the \`size\` variable based on the value of \`dice\`. To convert this logic into pie chart percentages, we analyze the outcome probabilities: - Small Size: This occurs when \`dice\` is 10 or below. Since dice values are usually integer and inclusive, if we assume a d20, this gives us 10 possible outcomes (1 through 10) out of 20 total outcomes. - Medium Size: This occurs when \`dice\` is between 11 and 16, inclusive. This range includes 6 possible outcomes (11 through 16). - Large Size: This occurs when \`dice\` is greater than 16, thereby including 4 possible outcomes (17 through 20). To convert these outcomes into percentages for a pie chart, we calculate the percentage of each size category out of the total possible outcomes (assuming a d20 scenario): - Small Size: ( frac{10}{20} = 0.5 ) or 50% - Medium Size: ( frac{6}{20} = 0.3 ) or 30% - Large Size: ( frac{4}{20} = 0.2 ) or 20% Thus, if representing these scenarios on a pie chart, the percentages would reflect 50% for Small, 30% for Medium, and 20% for Large, totaling 100%. Keep in mind, the actual implementation in a pie chart would depend on the specifics of your use case, including the range of dice you're considering and whether this distribution adequately represents the scenario you're modeling."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

From ashes, we can rise anew.\\" **Dr. Maruki:** \\"It's... not that simple for everyone. Some wounds are too deep, too dark...\\" **Reinhardt:** \\"I understand. My abilities allow me to see beyond the surface, to know things I shouldn't. It's frightening sometimes, to see the depth of pain and yet... There's also hope. Resilience.

Not everyone can be as strong as your mythical mother.\\" **Reinhardt:** \\"True strength isn't about never falling.

As Dr. Maruki's fist connected with his face, a brief flicker of red shimmered in Reinhardt’s eyes, indicating his unique powers were at play. Reinhardt: I didn’t say that to provoke you, Dr. Maruki. I said it because even with our abilities, there are things out of our control. I understand your pain, more than you might believe. Maruki, breathing heavily, lowered his fist, his anger subsiding slightly, replaced by a pained curiosity. He looked at Reinhardt, trying to regain his composure. Maruki: And what would you know of my pain? Your powers... what you can do... it's beyond anything I've worked towards. Reinhardt, adjusting his turtleneck to better cover the scar on his neck, took a step forward, his approach non-threatening. Reinhardt: My existence is a constant reminder of what you just said—things beyond our control. This scar...it was a gift from birth, a symbol of both pain and power. I can regenerate, manipulate fire and ash, even resurrect. But these abilities come with their own burdens. Maruki, intrigued despite himself, listened as Reinhardt's eyes momentarily flashed red, showcasing his infinite knowledge ability. Reinhardt: You seek to change hearts, to make realities where everyone's desires can be fulfilled. But some things... are meant to teach us. My mother, a Phoenix, taught me that from fire and ashes, new beginnings can rise. Not everything can be fixed the way we want. And understanding that is part of our journey. Maruki, calmer now, found himself sitting on a nearby bench, pondering Reinhardt’s words. He looked up, a trace of respect forming in his eyes. Maruki: So, you believe accepting our limitations is key... even when we have the power to change almost everything? Reinhardt: Yes, because it's not about how much we can change but knowing what should be changed. And sometimes, the most significant change comes from within. Your desire to erase pain is noble, Dr. Maruki, but pain can also shape us, teach us. For a moment, silence hung between them, both lost in their thoughts. Maruki finally stood up, offering a hand to Reinhardt, an unspoken truce between two individuals touched by extraordinary circumstances yet bound by their humanity. Maruki: Perhaps... I've been too focused on my own pain, my own desires. Your perspective, Reinhardt, it's... enlightening. Reinhardt, accepting the handshake, smiled slightly. Reinhardt: Everyone's pain is valid, Dr. Maruki, but how we choose to deal with it defines us. Maybe it's time we both learn a little more from our pains and our powers, to find a balance, not just for our sake but for those we wish to save. As they released their handshake, a mutual understanding had been formed. They were two different individuals from vastly different worlds, yet in that moment, they found common ground in their shared experiences and the burdens they carried."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

My methods... they can remove that suffering.\\" \\"Reinhardt: Suffering shapes us, Dr. Maruki. It's a harsh truth, but dodging it only causes more harm. You've seen the outcomes, haven't you? The confusion, the pain of those trapped in your ideal reality.\\" Maruki's gaze fell to the ground, conflicted. \\"Maruki: But to save everyone from their pain... Is that not worth some sacrifice?\\" \\"Reinhardt: Sacrifice is noble, but not when it costs our humanity. Your intentions are pure, but the path you chose is misguided. There is strength in confronting our pain, healing from it, not erasing it.\\" Maruki looked up, meeting Reinhardt's gaze. There was truth in his words, an uncomfortable truth that Maruki had tried to ignore. \\"Maruki: And what would you know of pain?

However, I can guide you through a simplified approach to accomplish your requirements, outline the main components of such a task, and advise on how it could be implemented and measured. # Step 1: Implementing RefinableHashSet The first challenge is to implement a concurrent Refinable HashSet. A detailed implementation of such a data structure might use techniques such as fine-grained locking or lock striping to manage concurrent access efficiently, adapting the lock granularity based on the current contention level. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume we have a simplistic RefinableHashSet class skeleton ready. Note that a full, efficient, and thread-safe implementation would require a detailed understanding of concurrency control mechanisms in Java, which cannot be fully covered here. \`\`\`java import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock; public class RefinableHashSet<E> { // Array of buckets, each is initially empty private Node<E>[] bucket; private Lock[] locks; private final int capacity; // default capacity public RefinableHashSet(int capacity) { this.capacity = capacity; this.bucket = (Node<E>[]) new Node[capacity]; // Initialize locks locks= new Lock[capacity]; for(int i=0; i< capacity; i++){ locks[i] = new ReentrantLock(); } } static class Node<E> { E item; Node<E> next; Node(E item) { this.item = item; this.next = null; } } public boolean contains(E item) { // Implement the contains logic here return false; } public boolean insert(E item) { // Implement the insert logic here return false; } public boolean remove(E item) { // Implement the remove logic here return false; } } \`\`\` # Step 2: Pre-filling and Testing with Threads You would need to prefill your hash set with 500,000 elements since it's specified to start 50% filled of 1 million nodes. # Step 3: Executing With Variable Thread Counts You will then create threads (ranging from 1 to 20 as specified) executing your operations — \`contains\`, \`insert\`, and \`remove\` — according to the given workload distributions (100C-0I-0D, 90C-9I-1D, etc.). \`\`\`java // Example of executing with varying thread counts public class TestRun { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { int threadCounts = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}; for (int numThreads : threadCounts) { // Setup your test here with numThreads // Pre-fill HashSet, prepare workload distribution, etc. // Remember to measure the execution time for 10 seconds } } } \`\`\` # Step 4: Measuring Throughput and Cache Misses - **Measuring Throughput**: You would keep track of the number of successful operations (e.g., successful \`contains\`, \`insert\`, and \`remove\` calls) during the 10-second test period and then calculate the average over five runs for each thread count and workload configuration. - **Measuring Cache Misses**: For measuring cache misses, you'd use the \`perf\` tool outside of the Java code, running it in Linux where your Java application is running. Example command: \`perf stat -e cache-misses java -jar YourApp.jar\`, where \`YourApp.jar\` is the compiled version of your test application. This approach gives an overview and starting point rather than an exhaustive implementation, which would be quite complex and lengthy due to the intricacies of efficient concurrent programming and detailed performance analysis."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"Given the foundational understanding and setup from the initial guide, let's proceed to outline how you could further approach the execution with varying thread counts and the measurement of both throughput and cache misses in more practical steps. # Implementing the Workload Executor To test different workloads systematically, you need to create a flexible mechanism for simulating each specified workload mix (e.g., 100C-0I-0D, 90C-9I-1D, etc.) under varying thread conditions. Defining a Task A \`Runnable\` or \`Callable\` can represent an individual task (contains, insert, or remove operation) that will be executed by a thread. \`\`\`java public interface Operation<E> { void execute(RefinableHashSet<E> set); } \`\`\` You can implement different operations based on this interface. Distributing Workload For each thread, based on the workload distribution, decide how many operations it should execute of each type (contains, insert, remove) and instantiate these operations accordingly. Executor Service Use \`ExecutorService\` to manage and execute threads efficiently. Here's a simplified setup: \`\`\`java ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads); \`\`\` Schedule tasks (operations) for execution based on the calculated distribution for the specific workload. \`\`\`java for (int i = 0; i < numOperations; i++) { // Assuming Operation is an interface implemented by your specific operation classes Operation<E> operation = ...; // Decide based on the workload distribution executorService.submit(() -> operation.execute(refinableHashSet)); } \`\`\` Remember to shutdown the \`ExecutorService\` properly after each test run and to wait for all tasks to complete. # Threading Scenarios You'll loop through the desired thread count scenarios (from 1 to 20), configuring your \`ExecutorService\` with the corresponding number of threads each time. For every thread count, you'll also iterate through your set of workload configurations, repeating each configuration multiple times (for instance, 5 runs as specified) to calculate the average throughput. # Measuring Throughput For throughput measurement, count the number of operations completed within the 10-second window. Use \`AtomicInteger\` or another thread-safe counter to accurately record operation completions across all threads. Divide the total operation count by the duration (in seconds) to obtain the throughput, and then average this across your runs. # Collecting Cache Misses with \`perf\` To use \`perf\` to measure cache misses, execute your Java application under \`perf\` monitoring. The basic command format would be: \`\`\`bash perf stat -e cache-misses,cache-references java -jar YourApplication.jar \`\`\` This command measures the total number of cache misses and cache references, which you can then relate back to your application's performance metrics. Execute this command once for each thread scenario and workload configuration to gather comparative data. # Bringing It All Together The final step is integrating these components — workload execution, throughput measurement, and \`perf\` monitoring — into a cohesive testing framework. This setup involves: 1. Pre-filling your \`RefinableHashSet\` with 500,000 elements. 2. Iterating over your set of thread counts. 3. For each thread count, iterating over your workload distributions. 4. For each workload distribution, executing several test runs, capturing throughput data, and if possible, running \`perf\` in parallel to measure cache misses. 5. Computing average throughput for each scenario and collecting \`perf\` data to analyze cache behavior. Given the complexity of this task, expect to iterate on your design, especially as you refine how best to pre-fill your data structure, distribute workloads evenly across threads, and accurately measure performance outcomes. This explanation provides a high-level roadmap rather than precise code due to space constraints and the complexity of the task. Each component (from the data structure to the performance measurement setup) involves significant design and coding effort, which would be best approached incrementally, testing each part thoroughly before integrating it into the larger framework."},{"instruction":"so how many number of steps are there","output":"Let's break down the project into a concise step-by-step workflow to clarify the process of implementing and testing a concurrent Refinable HashSet data structure with varied thread counts and workloads, measuring throughput and cache misses. The project can be methodologically structured into the following main steps: # Step 1: Implement the Refinable HashSet 1. **Define the Data Structure**: Implement the baseline \`RefinableHashSet\` class, ensuring it supports concurrent operations. This includes setting up the underlying data structure (e.g., buckets array), lock mechanism (potentially with resizing lock arrays for refinable behavior), and ensuring thread safety for the basic operations: \`contains\`, \`insert\`, and \`remove\`. # Step 2: Pre-filling the HashSet 2. **Initialize Data**: Pre-fill the \`RefinableHashSet\` with 500,000 elements to meet the requirement of starting with 50% of the elements, given a total expected capacity of 1 million nodes. # Step 3: Design Workload and Operation Distribution 3. **Define Workloads**: Create distinct workload configurations (100C-0I-0D, 90C-9I-1D, etc.), where \`C\`, \`I\`, and \`D\` stand for contains, insert, and delete operations, respectively. 4. **Operation Implementation**: Implement classes or methods that encapsulate each type of operation (\`contains\`, \`insert\`, \`remove\`) that can be executed by threads. # Step 4: Execute Tests with Variable Thread Counts 5. **Setup Threads**: For each specified number of threads (1, 2, 4, 6, ..., 20), configure and run a test that executes the pre-defined mix of operations based on the workload configurations. 6. **Distribute Operations**: Assign operations to threads based on the workload distribution for each test scenario (thread count + workload type), ensuring each thread knows which operation to execute and how frequently. # Step 5: Measure Throughput 7. **Record Operation Counts**: During each 10-second test run, count the total number of operations executed across all threads. 8. **Calculate Throughput**: Compute the throughput as operations per second for each test run, then average across multiple runs for each scenario for accuracy and reliability. # Step 6: Measure Cache Misses with Perf Tool 9. **Setup \`perf\` Monitoring**: Use the \`perf\` tool to monitor and record cache misses and cache references during the execution of the Java application under different scenarios. 10. **Analyze \`perf\` Data**: After each test run, examine the \`perf\` output to understand cache behavior under different thread counts and workload distributions. # Step 7: Collect and Analyze Results 11. **Aggregate Data**: Consolidate throughput data and cache miss information for all test scenarios. 12. **Analysis**: Analyze the collected data to understand the behavior and performance implications of different thread counts and operation mixes on the Refinable HashSet implementation. Look for patterns such as how throughput is affected by increasing thread counts and which workloads lead to higher cache misses. # Step 8: Optimization (Optional) 13. **Iterate Based on Findings**: Based on the performance analysis, you might identify potential optimizations for your \`RefinableHashSet\` implementation or how operations are executed and distributed among threads. These steps outline a comprehensive framework for developing, testing, and analyzing a concurrent Refinable HashSet in Java. Each step involves significant planning, implementation, and testing effort, highlighting the complexity of designing high-performance concurrent data structures and accurately measuring their performance under various conditions."},{"instruction":"now lets take different steps as different class files in java","output":"Dividing the project into different class files will help organize the code, enhance modularity, and improve readability.

This is not a fully refined lock mechanism but should give you a starting point for developing more advanced concurrency control mechanisms. **Please Note**: This simplified version aims to showcase the structure for concurrent operations and does not include dynamic lock resizing or advanced refinement for lock controls which would be expected in a full implementation. \`\`\`java import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock; public class RefinableHashSet<T> { private final int capacity; // Capacity of the hash set private volatile Lock[] locks; // Array for lock striping private volatile Node<T>[] buckets; // Buckets for storing the elements private static class Node<T> { final T item; Node<T> next; Node(T item, Node<T> next) { this.item = item; this.next = next; } } @SuppressWarnings(\\"unchecked\\") public RefinableHashSet(int capacity) { this.capacity = capacity; this.buckets = (Node<T>[]) new Node[capacity]; this.locks = new Lock[capacity]; for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) { locks[i] = new ReentrantLock(); } } private final int hash(T item) { return item.hashCode() % capacity; // Simplistic hashing } public boolean contains(T item) { int hash = hash(item); locks[hash].lock(); try { for (Node<T> n = buckets[hash]; n != null; n = n.next) { if (n.item.equals(item)) { return true; } } } finally { locks[hash].unlock(); } return false; } public boolean insert(T item) { int hash = hash(item); locks[hash].lock(); try { for (Node<T> n = buckets[hash]; n != null; n = n.next) { if (n.item.equals(item)) { return false; // Item already exists } } buckets[hash] = new Node<>(item, buckets[hash]); return true; } finally { locks[hash].unlock(); } } public boolean remove(T item) { int hash = hash(item); locks[hash].lock(); try { Node<T> prev = null; for (Node<T> n = buckets[hash]; n != null; prev = n, n = n.next) { if (n.item.equals(item)) { if (prev != null) prev.next = n.next; // Remove item else buckets[hash] = n.next; // Item is the first in the bucket return true; } } } finally { locks[hash].unlock(); } return false; } } \`\`\` # Key Points: 1. **Concurrent Handling**: The use of separate locks for each bucket (\`lock striping\`) increases concurrency by allowing different threads to operate on different segments of the hash set concurrently. 2. **Capacity and Hashing**: The capacity is fixed, and the hash function is a simple modulo operation. In a full implementation, you'd likely want a better hash function and dynamic resizing capabilities. 3. **Synchronization**: Each method (\`contains\`, \`insert\`, \`remove\`) locks its relevant bucket before proceeding, ensuring thread safety at the cost of some lock contention. 4. **Volatility and Locks**: The \`volatile\` keyword on \`locks\` and \`buckets\` arrays suggests that in a more refined implementation, you might support dynamic resizing and hence need to ensure visibility of these changes across threads. However, resizing logic is not included here. 5. **Simplification**: This example does not showcase refinement locking or advanced concurrency optimizations. Implementing a truly efficient and refined concurrent hash set is a significant undertaking that would involve dealing with many concurrency challenges and optimizations. Consider this framework as a basis upon which more sophisticated and performant concurrent sets could be built, perhaps inspired by the design and tactics used in Java's concurrent collections."},{"instruction":"now give code for Operation.java","output":"To design an operation interface in Java that can be implemented by different types of operations (like insert, remove, and contains) on the \`RefinableHashSet\`, you can define a simple generic interface that declares an \`execute\` method. This method should take an instance of \`RefinableHashSet\` and an item of the generic type \`T\` as parameters. Each implementation of this interface will define how that specific operation (insert, remove, contains) is executed on the hash set. Here's how you could define such an interface: # \`Operation.java\` \`\`\`java public interface Operation<T> { void execute(RefinableHashSet<T> set, T item); } \`\`\` # Implementing Operations Following the \`Operation\` interface, you can implement specific operations that work on \`RefinableHashSet\`.

This approach allows for polymorphic operation execution, which can be particularly useful for testing or simulating different scenarios where various operations are performed on the set in a concurrent environment. You would typically use these operation implementations when constructing test scenarios or workloads, passing instances of these operations to threads or executors that process them against an instance of \`RefinableHashSet\`. This design follows the Command pattern, encapsulating a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests and support for queuing, logging, and callback operations."},{"instruction":"now give code for:Workload.java","output":"The \`Workload\` class is designed to encapsulate a specific mix of operations (\`insert\`, \`remove\`, \`contains\`) to be executed on the \`RefinableHashSet\`. This object can store a predefined list of operations along with their respective items to be processed. When testing different scenarios, you can create instances of \`Workload\` representing the various mixes of operations you want to analyze. Here is a basic implementation of the \`Workload\` class in Java, taking into account the \`Operation\` interface we defined earlier: # \`Workload.java\` \`\`\`java import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; public class Workload<T> { private final List<OperationTask<T>> tasks; public Workload() { this.tasks = new ArrayList<>(); } public void addTask(Operation<T> operation, T item) { tasks.add(new OperationTask<>(operation, item)); } public List<OperationTask<T>> getTasks() { return tasks; } public static class OperationTask<T> { private final Operation<T> operation; private final T item; public OperationTask(Operation<T> operation, T item) { this.operation = operation; this.item = item; } public void execute(RefinableHashSet<T> set) { this.operation.execute(set, item); } } } \`\`\` # Explanation: - **\`Workload\` Class**: This class holds a list of tasks, where each task represents an operation to be executed on the hash set along with the item to operate on. - **\`addTask\` Method**: This method allows you to add a new operation (\`insert\`, \`remove\`, \`contains\`) to the workload, specifying the operation and the item it should operate on. - **\`getTasks\` Method**: This method returns the list of tasks added to this workload. - **\`OperationTask<T>\` Inner Class**: Represents a specific task, encapsulating both the operation to be executed and the item to operate on. This approach separates the definition of what operations are in a workload from their execution. - **\`execute\` Method in \`OperationTask<T>\`**: Executes the encapsulated operation on the given \`RefinableHashSet\` instance. # Usage: Creating and using a \`Workload\` would involve adding specific operations to it and then, at execution time, iterating over these tasks and executing them against an instance of \`RefinableHashSet\`. Here's a brief example: \`\`\`java // Initialize the hash set RefinableHashSet<Integer> hashSet = new RefinableHashSet<>(100); // Assuming a capacity of 100 for simplicity // Create a workload Workload<Integer> workload = new Workload<>(); // Assuming you have instances of Operation-implementing classes workload.addTask(new InsertOperation<>(), 1); workload.addTask(new RemoveOperation<>(), 2); workload.addTask(new ContainsOperation<>(), 3); // Execute workload for (Workload.OperationTask<Integer> task : workload.getTasks()) { task.execute(hashSet); } \`\`\` This approach provides a flexible way to define and execute groups of operations on the \`RefinableHashSet\`, facilitating testing under various scenarios with mixed operation types."},{"instruction":"give code for: TestExecutor.java","output":"The \`TestExecutor\` class is responsible for orchestrating the execution of different workloads on the \`RefinableHashSet\` with varying numbers of threads.

Each task in a workload is submitted to the executor service for execution. The tasks keep executing repeatedly until the specified \`duration\` is finished. - **Throughput Measurement**: This example measures throughput by counting the total number of operations executed (across all threads) and dividing it by the total duration of the test in seconds. The \`AtomicLong\` is used for \`operationsCount\` to ensure thread-safety. - **Test Duration**: The executor is shut down after the specified \`duration\`. Tasks check against the elapsed time to decide whether to continue executing, ensuring that the execution stops around the intended test duration. # Example Execution: To execute a test with this class, you would create an instance of \`RefinableHashSet<T>\`, prepare a list of \`Workload<T>\` objects with desired operations, and call \`executeTest\` with the appropriate parameters, such as: \`\`\`java // This is a hypothetical example assuming necessary classes are defined and implemented as expected. public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { RefinableHashSet<Integer> set = new RefinableHashSet<>(100); // Capacity is just an example List<Workload<Integer>> workloads = new ArrayList<>(); // Populate your workloads based on your requirements TestExecutor<Integer> executor = new TestExecutor<>(); executor.executeTest(set, workloads, 10, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // 10 threads, 10 seconds } } \`\`\` This setup facilitates running concurrency tests on the data structure with a varied load and thread count, providing a solid basis for performance analysis and optimization."},{"instruction":"code for PerfMeasurement.java","output":"Integrating \`perf\` tool measurements directly into Java is not straightforward because \`perf\` is a Linux tool run from the command line and it monitors processes from outside the Java Virtual Machine. To capture \`perf\` statistics like cache misses or CPU cycles for a Java application, you typically run \`perf\` from the terminal, specifying the Java process you want to monitor. However, you can automate the process of starting \`perf\` when your Java application runs, and then parsing its output after the application completes. This requires executing shell commands from Java, which can be done using the \`Runtime.exec()\` method or the \`ProcessBuilder\` class. Below is an example that demonstrates how you might approach running \`perf stat\` for a specified duration, targeting the Java process itself.

This is where you might initiate \`perf\` monitoring if you're including that in your tests. Remember, running \`perf\` would require appropriate permissions and might add complexity in synchronizing its startup and shutdown with your Java test executions. - **Result Interpretation**: The example captures and prints very basic performance information (simply the fact that a test run has started and finished).

This chapter explores the transformative period marked by the Meiji Restoration and the Xinhai Revolution, events that led to the establishment of enduring political structures in Japan and China, drastically altering their course in the annals of history. The Japanese Accord: Shogunate and Imperial Harmony The year 1868 heralded a new era in Japan, one that was not characterized by outright revolution but instead by an unprecedented accord between the conservative forces backing the Tokugawa Shogunate and the liberals advocating for imperial restoration and modernization. This period, often referred to as the Meiji Compromise, saw the Tokugawa family retain considerable power and influence, assuming roles akin to constitutional monarchs of Europe, while simultaneously restoring the sovereignty of the Imperial House of Great Yamato over the country. This arrangement proved to be a masterstroke of political maneuvering, ensuring a stable transition towards a more industrialized and militarized nation-state. The Great Japanese Empire that emerged was a constitutional monarchy by design, yet one that cleverly integrated the samurai class into its new political structure as the Kazoku, preserving the legacy and honor of Japan’s warrior class while transitioning to a modern bureaucratic and parliamentary system. Under this new system, the Emperor of Japan regained significant powers as both the head of state and the commander of armed forces, symbolizing national unity and the continuity of imperial divine heritage. Political reforms led to the establishment of a modern parliamentary system wherein the Prime Minister was selected from the majority party, reflecting a blend of traditional hierarchy with newfound democratic principles. The Ming Restoration: China's Phoenix Moment Parallel to Japan's evolution, China experienced its own national upheaval with the Xinhai Revolution, which, contrary to leading to the establishment of a republic as observed elsewhere, culminated in the restoration of the Ming dynasty. Spearheaded by the Beiyang Government, this movement was not just a simple change of guard but a profound restructuring of Chinese polity and identity. The restored Ming Dynasty, while symbolically significant, operated under the aegis of the Beiyang Government, creating a unique political entity that was a protectorate in all but name under Japanese influence. The focus on industrial and economic development, alongside reforms in education and infrastructure, mirrored the changes in Japan, contributing to a renaissance of Chinese power and culture. However, the Beiyang Government's alignment and reliance on Japan brought about a nuanced independence that was both a strength and a vulnerability. The Ming restoration, while achieving the nationalistic goal of re-establishing a Han Chinese dynasty, also positioned China within Japan’s sphere of influence, shaping a complex relationship that would define their interactions in the years to come. The Periphery of Power: Nationalist China and Beyond The restoration of the Royal House of Koxinga in Guangdong and Guangxi under Japanese influence brought about a unique sub-national entity that preserved Chinese maritime prowess and commercial ambition. Sun Wen, marginalized in the broader narrative of national restoration, found his legacy limited to the peripheries of the emerging Chinese state. This period was marked by the continued existence of factional states and entities, from Nationalist China to the remnants of the Qing in Manchuria, all contributing to a fragmented yet vibrantly diverse political landscape. Japan, through its protection of these states, wielded significant influence, securing its strategic interests while promoting a semblance of stability and development. Conclusion: An Era of Compromise and Complexity The late 19th and early 20th centuries in East Asia were defined not by outright revolutions or collapses but by nuanced compromises and restorations that blended old traditions with the exigencies of modern statecraft. Japan and China, through their respective historical paths, embarked on a journey that preserved their unique heritage while embracing the challenges of a rapidly changing world. This era of compromise, marked by the successful integration of military aristocracies into modern states and the restoration of dynasties in new political contexts, set the stage for a century of transformation. The Great Japanese Empire and the Ming-restored China, alongside the various states that emerged during this period, navigated the complexities of internal reform, external pressures, and the inevitable march towards modernization, leaving an indelible mark on the tapestry of world history."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary. He's Born between an human father and a woman Phoenix. He has short and brown hair and wears jeans, black turtleneck and red jacket with white feathers. He has a burn Scar in his neck covered by the turtleneck, he had It from birth (precisely when he was still in her mother's womb. The origins of the scar Is still a mystery). He Is very kind. His abilities are: Regeneration, Fire and ash manipulation, Resurrection and infinite knowledge (when he has Red eyes, he can know everything about people, objects and information beyond his own understanding. Example: he can know what weapon he's holding and how to use It, even if he never used before, or he can know someone's name even if they never introduced themselves). Based on these infos, create a dialogue between Reinhardt and Dr. Maruki. It starts with: \\"Reinhardt: No matter what desire drives you, in the end, you couldn't save Rumi... Maruki: SHUT UP!\\" ECC... (Don't make Reinhardt talk about himself)","output":"**Reinhardt:** No matter what desire drives you, in the end, you couldn't save Rumi... **Dr. Maruki:** SHUT UP! How do you... How could you possibly know about that? **Reinhardt:** Because right now, I can understand everything. Even the pain buried deep within your heart. I can see the tragedies that drive our fates, Dr. Maruki. **Dr. Maruki:** Does that mean you also understand my intentions, then? The reason why I've chosen to rewrite reality? **Reinhardt:** I do. You believe by altering people's cognition, erasing their hardships, you can ultimately save them from despair. But the path to true salvation doesn’t lie in manipulation of realities. **Dr. Maruki:** And what would you suggest then? Accepting the pain? Embracing the tragedies that life throws at us? **Reinhardt:** It's about finding strength in adversity, growing stronger and wiser from the challenges we face. It is human to suffer, yes, but it is also human to overcome. **Dr. Maruki:** You speak as though you're beyond human. That you have all the answers. **Reinhardt:** I don't claim to have all the answers, Dr. Maruki. But I know that true healing begins when we accept the truth of our wounds, not when we pretend they don't exist. **Dr. Maruki:** And what of unbearable wounds? Should people just live with their pain? **Reinhardt:** There are ways to find light even in the deepest darkness. The issue is whether we're brave enough to accept the pain and seek out that light. It's not about erasing the dark parts of our lives but learning to carry them with us, turning them into a part of our strength. **Dr. Maruki:** Such ideals... But I'm afraid not everyone is as strong as you are. **Reinhardt:** Perhaps. But doesn't the very nature of being human lie in striving to surpass our limits? We don't need to rewrite reality to find peace or salvation. We just need to help each other to rise above.

Here is the difference between \`result\` and \`get()\` in Celery: 1. \`result\`: - When a task is executed asynchronously using Celery, a \`result\` object is returned immediately. This \`result\` object represents the asynchronous computation and can be used to track the state and get the result of the task. - The \`result\` object provides methods to check the state of the task (e.g., \`state\` attribute) and to retrieve the result once the task is completed (e.g., \`get()\` method). - The \`result\` object allows you to perform additional operations on the task result, such as checking if the task was successful, handling exceptions, and more. Example: \`\`\`python result = my_task.delay(10) # Check the state of the task print(result.state) # Get the result of the task task_result = result.get() \`\`\` 2. \`get()\`: - The \`get()\` method is used to retrieve the final result of the task from the \`result\` object. It blocks the execution until the task is completed and returns the result when available. - If the task has not completed when \`get()\` is called, it will wait until the task finishes. You can also specify a timeout parameter to limit the waiting time. - Calling \`get()\` on a \`result\` object is a synchronous operation that waits for the task completion and returns the result to the caller. Example: \`\`\`python result = my_task.delay(10) task_result = result.get() \`\`\` In summary, the \`result\` object is used to represent the asynchronous task execution, while \`get()\` is a method on the \`result\` object that blocks the execution and waits for the task result.

Let's break down the components of the log message: - \`autocomplete.autocomplete.create_autocomplete\`: This is the name of the task that is being executed. In this case, it seems to be an autocomplete task in a module named \`autocomplete\` with the task named \`create_autocomplete\`. - \`[1fa81dbe-8c18-4ca5-b64f-3ace9dc612db]\`: This is the unique identifier (UUID) assigned to this specific instance of the task. Each task execution in Celery is uniquely identified by a task ID. - \`received\`: This indicates the state of the task, which means that the task has been received by the Celery worker and is in the process of being executed. In Celery, tasks are sent from the client to the Celery workers for execution. When a task is received by a Celery worker, it goes through the stages of being queued, executing, and completed. The log message you provided captures the initial stage where the task is received and begins processing.

Idempotency ensures that the same task with the same parameters is only executed once, and subsequent requests are ignored until the task is completed. Here are the steps to achieve this: 1. Enable idempotency for the task: You can enable idempotency for a task in Celery by setting the \`idempotent\` property of the task to \`True\` in the task decorator or class definition. \`\`\`python from celery import Celery app = Celery('tasks') @app.task(bind=True, idempotent=True) def my_task(self, param1, param2): # Task implementation return result \`\`\` 2. Use a task result backend: Configure a result backend in Celery settings to store and retrieve task results. This allows Celery to check the task status and result before executing a duplicate task. 3. Check task status before resubmitting: Before submitting a new task, check the status of the previous task by querying the task result backend. If the previous task is still pending or running, do not resubmit the task. Here's an example of how you could check the task status before resubmitting a task: \`\`\`python from celery import Celery app = Celery('tasks') app.config_from_object('celeryconfig') def is_task_completed(task_id): result = app.AsyncResult(task_id) return result.ready() def submit_task_if_not_completed(param1, param2): prev_task_id = get_previous_task_id(param1, param2) # Implement a function to retrieve previous task id if not prev_task_id or is_task_completed(prev_task_id): new_task = my_task.apply_async((param1, param2)) save_task_id(param1, param2, new_task.id) # Implement a function to save the new task id # Call this function to submit a task only if the previous instance is completed submit_task_if_not_completed('param_value1', 'param_value2') \`\`\` By following these steps, you can ensure that Celery does not execute an identical task until the previous instance with the same parameters has been completed. It helps prevent duplicate task execution and ensures task idempotency in Celery."},{"instruction":"можно ли просто дать имя задаче и отследжвать чтобы она не принималась пока не будте выполнена задача с таким же именем","output":"Celery не имеет встроенной функциональности для прямого отслеживания и управления задачами на уровне их имен. Однако, вы можете создать собственный механизм для ограничения выполнения задач с одинаковым именем до завершения предыдущей задачи с таким же именем. Один из способов реализации этого механизма - использовать внешний хранилище (например, базу данных или кэш), где будут храниться идентификаторы предыдущих задач с указанным именем. Перед запуском новой задачи, вы будете проверять статус предыдущей задачи на основе ее идентификатора. Вот пример того, как можно реализовать эту логику: \`\`\`python from celery import Celery from celery.result import AsyncResult app = Celery('tasks') app.config_from_object('celeryconfig') def is_task_completed(task_id): result = AsyncResult(task_id) return result.ready() def submit_task_if_not_completed(task_name, task_args): # Получить идентификатор предыдущей задачи с указанным именем из вашего хранилища prev_task_id = get_previous_task_id(task_name) if not prev_task_id or is_task_completed(prev_task_id): new_task = app.send_task(task_name, args=task_args) # Сохранить идентификатор новой задачи в ваше хранилище save_task_id(task_name, new_task.id) # Вызвать эту функцию для отправки новой задачи только если предыдущая была завершена submit_task_if_not_completed('task_name', ['param1', 'param2']) \`\`\` В этом примере функция \`submit_task_if_not_completed\` проверяет статус предыдущей задачи с указанным именем перед отправкой новой задачи.

После успешного выполнения задачи, ее результат может быть кеширован для будущих запросов с такими же параметрами. Вот как можно реализовать идемпотентность в Celery: 1. Установите результатный бэкенд в настройках Celery для сохранения результатов задач: \`\`\`python # Пример настройки Redis в качестве результатного бэкенда app.conf.result_backend = 'redis://localhost:6379/0' \`\`\` 2.

После успешного выполнения задачи, вы можете кешировать результат или пометить ее как выполненную в хранилище. При последующих запросах на выполнение задачи с такими же параметрами, проверяйте статус выполнения задачи с помощью кеша/хранилища перед запуском новой задачи. Пример использования Redis для кеширования результатов задач: \`\`\`python import redis redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0) def is_task_completed(param1, param2): key = f\\"{param1}-{param2}\\" return redis_client.exists(key) def mark_task_completed(param1, param2): key = f\\"{param1}-{param2}\\" redis_client.set(key, 1) \`\`\` 4.

マルクスは，周知のように国家に関して書物を著わす計画をもっていたが，しかしながら書くことはできなかった。マルクスは初期の仕事で，ヘーゲルの法哲学やそのフランス革命に関する議論との関連で国家問題について論及しているが，それを別にするならば，基本的には『フランスの階級闘争』，『ブリューメル18日』さらに『フランスの内乱』という政治的主著の中でのみ国家に取り組んでいるにすぎない。これらのテキストをより正確に考察してみるならば，マルクスは，より厳密にいえば，国家についてではなく国家装置について論述していることがはっきりしてくる。 ところでエンゲルスは次のように述べているのであるが，その場合，国家と国家装置の両概念を同一視している。 「階級対立のかたちをとって運動してきたこれまでの社会には，国家が必要であった。つまり，そのときどきの搾取階級が自分たちの外的な生産諸条件を維持するための，したがって，とくに現存の生産様式によって規定される抑圧の諸条件（奴隷制，農奴制または隷農制，賃労働）のもとに被搾取階級を力ずくで抑えておくための組織が必要であった」。ここでは国家は一つの装置として，エンゲルスの言葉によれば，一つの「機関」〔Körperschaft〕として論じられている。 マルクスは『フランスの内乱』の中で，この国家装置の生成についてつぎのように粗描している。「いたるところにゆきわたった複雑な軍事的，官僚的，教権的，司法的諸機関をもつ中央集権的な国家機構は，生きた市民社会にうわばみのように巻きついているが，これははじめ絶対君主制の時代に生まれかけていた近代社会が封建制度からの解放をめざしてたたかうための武器としてつくりだされた。中世の諸侯や都市や聖職者の領主特権は，統一的な国家権力の属性に変えられ，封建的大官は有給の国家職員とおきかえられ，中世の土地領主の従者たちや都市市民の同職団体から武器がとりあげられて，営備軍に引き渡され，相争う中世的諸権力の雑然たる無政府状態は体系的で階層的な分業にもとづく国家権力の整然たる方式とおきかえられた」。 このような国家装置は，社会的な富の体現としての貨幣が既に普及し，農業が封建時代のような社会的に支配的な生産部門ではもはやなくなったときはじめて確立しえたのである。それに伴って封建階級は社会的に重要な生産要素の処分権能を失い，絶対君主制下においてそうであったように，社会的剰余生産物の単なる横領者·消費者にすぎなくなったのである。このことが封建階級のブルジョアジーに対する決定的な弱点であった。絶対君主制とは，ブルジョアジーが自らの支配を政治的にいまだ樹立していないが，その一方では古い封建階級が社会的な剩余生産物への請求権を国家装置やその下部諸機関，つまり常備軍，警察，国家行政および地方自治行政，裁判所，税制ならびに財政制度などによってもはやかろうじて行使しえていたにすぎない段階の国家形態とみなされうる。 ブルジョア革命は，これまで国家装置の発展を妨げて来た「中世的な残骸，つまり，領主的，貴族的諸特権，都市およびツンフトの独占，そして地方行政諸制度」を終焉させたのである。国家装置はブルジョアジーの階級支配における一つの近代的な手段となったのである。 「近代工業の進歩が資本と労働との階級対立を発展，拡大，深化させるのに応じて，国家権力はますます労働者階級の抑圧のための公的権力，階級支配のための機関としての性格をおびて来た」。 エンゲルスによれば，国家（階級社会もまた同様である）は社会の生産力発展のある一定の段階で登場してくる。 「搾取する階級と搾取される階級，支配する階級と支配される階級とに社会が分裂したのは，それまでは生産の発展が貧弱だったことの必然的帰結であった。社会の総労働が，全員がかつかつ生きてゆくのに必要なものをほんのわずか上まわるだけの生産物しかもたらさないあいだは，したがって，大多数の社会成員の時間の全部またはほとんど全部が労働にとられているあいだは，社会は必然的にいろいろな階級に分かれる。もっぱら労役に服するこの大多数者とならんで，直接の生産的労働から解放された一階級がかたちづくられ，彼らが労働の指揮，国務，司法，科学，芸術などの，社会の共同の業務にあたるのである。だから，階級区分の基礎にあるのは分業の法則である。だが，それだからといって，このような諸階級への区分が暴力や強奪，奸計や欺瞞によって達成されたものではないということにならないし，また，支配階級がひとたびその座にすわったなら，かならず労働する階級を犠牲として自分の支配をかため，社会的指揮を大衆の搾取に変えてきたということを否定するものでもない。」それゆえ，国家は分業の，社会の諸階級への必然的な分裂化の一定の発展段階の産物である。つまり，エンゲルスが述べているように，国家は「けっして外部から社会におしつけられた権力ではない。同様にそれは，ヘーゲルの主張するような，『人倫的理念が現実化したもの』でも『理性が形象化し現実化したもの』でもない。それは，むしろ一定の発展段階における社会の産物なのである。国家は，この社会が自分自身との解決しえない矛盾にまきこまれ，自分では払いのける力のない和解しえない諸対立に分裂したことの告白である。ところで，これらの諸対立，すなわち相対抗する経済的利害をもつ諸階級が無益な闘争のうちに自分自身と社会をほろぼさないためには，外見上（！）社会のうえに立ってこの衝突を緩和し，それを『秩序』の枠の中にたもつべき権力が必要となった。そして，社会からうまれながら社会のうえに立ち，社会にたいしてますます外的なものとなってゆくこの権力が国家である。」 これはエンゲルスの有名な国家規定であり，これがドイツ社会民主党内に多くの混乱をひきおこしてきたところのものである。「国家」は，ドイツにおいては古来一つの定着した理念であるが-少なくともそのようにみえるが——エンゲルスによってもまた，ここで，闘争の渦中に身をおく諸階級の特殊利害を平安と秩序，理性と調停へと呼び戻すために，とくに形成された制度として理解されるのである。 エンゲルスは，上で引用した彼の国家規定を，同じ『家族·私有財産·国家の起源』で次のように書くとき，修正しているのである。 「国家は階級対立を抑制しておく必要から生じたものであるから，しかし同時にこれらの階級の衝突のただなかに生じたものであるから，通例，国家はもっとも勢力のある，経済的に支配する階級の国家である。この階級は国家をもちいて政治的にも支配する階級となり，このようにして，被抑圧階級を抑圧し搾取するための新しい手段を獲得する」。”翻译为中文","output":"关于资产阶级国家的逻辑构成 1 国家规定——国家与国家机构 马克思，众所周知，曾计划撰写有关国家的著作，但最终未能实现。在马克思的早期工作中，他讨论了国家问题，特别是与黑格尔的法哲学以及关于法国革命的讨论相关，但如果我们将这部分内容排除，基本上马克思仅在他的主要政治著作《法兰西的阶级斗争》、《布鲁马里十八日》和《法兰西的内战》中着手讨论国家。更准确地检视这些文本，可以明显看到马克思实际上是在论述国家机构而非国家本身。 恩格斯如此表述，但在这种情况下，他将国家和国家机构的概念视为同一概念。“在过去一切以阶级对立运动着的社会中，国家都是必需的。也就是说，为了维持那个时期的压迫阶级的外部生产条件，从而，在奴隶制、农奴制或雇佣劳动等由当时的生产方式所规定的压迫条件下，以武力压制被压迫阶级，这样一个组织是必需的。”在这里，国家被视为一个装置，用恩格斯的话说，就是一种“机构”。 在《法兰西的内战》中，马克思粗略描述了国家机构的产生：“一个拥有广泛的军事、官僚、教会、司法机构的中央集权机构像巨蟒一样缠绕在充满活力的市民社会之上，这个机构最初是作为现代社会在脱离封建制度的解放斗争中开发出来的武器，那时它刚刚开始出现在绝对君主制时代。中世纪的贵族、城市、教士的特权被转变为统一的国家权力特征，封建大官被替换为有薪的国家职员，中世纪的地主和城市市民的同业公会被剥夺武器，交给常备军，争斗的中世纪权力的混乱无政府状态被替换为基于系统的、等级分明的国家权力秩序。” 这样的国家机构是在货币作为社会财富的体现普及，农业不再像封建时代那样是社会上主导的生产部门时，才得以确立的。随着封建阶级失去对社会重要生产要素的控制权，就像在绝对君主制下一样，它们变成了仅仅是社会剩余产品的占有者和消费者。这是封建阶级对资产阶级的决定性弱点。绝对君主制可以被视为资产阶级尚未在政治上确立自己的统治，而另一方面，旧的封建阶级仅仅能通过国家机构及其下属机构，如常备军、警察、国家行政和地方自治行政、法院、税收以及财政制度来行使对社会剩余产品的索求权的阶段。 资产阶级革命结束了阻碍国家机构发展的“中世纪残余，即领主的、贵族的特权、城市及行会的垄断以及地方行政制度。”国家机构成为资产阶级阶级统治中的一种现代手段。 “随着现代工业的进步促进了资本与劳动之间的阶级对立的发展、扩大、深化，国家权力越来越多地成为公权力，为压迫工人阶级，作为阶级统治的机构。”按恩格斯的说法，国家（同样的，阶级社会也是如此）是社会生产力发展到一定阶段的产物。“社会分裂为剥削阶级和被剥削阶级，统治阶级和被统治阶级，这是之前生产发展贫弱的必然结果。只要社会总劳动只能带来稍微超过所有人勉强维生所需的生产品，因此，大多数社会成员的全部或几乎全部时间都被劳动占据，社会就必然会分裂为各种不同的阶级。与仅仅从事体力劳动的这个大多数相伴，形成了一个被解放出来不直接参与生产劳动的阶层，他们负责劳动指挥、国事、司法、科学、艺术等社会共同事务。因此，阶级划分的基础是分工的法则。但是，这并不意味着这种对各种阶级的划分不是通过暴力、掠夺、诡计或欺诈来实现的，也不否认一旦统治阶级坐稳其位，就会固化自己的统治，将社会指挥转化为对大众的剥削。”因此，国家是分工、社会向各个阶级的必然分化的一定发展阶段的产物。恩格斯所述，即国家“绝不是被外部强加于社会之上的权力。同样，它也不是黑格尔所主张的‘人伦理念的现实化’或‘理性的形象化和现实化’。它更多的是社会在某一发展阶段的产物。国家是这个社会陷入自身无法解决的矛盾、无力摆脱的不可和解的对立中，其分裂情况的自我告白。在这些对立中，即经济利益相抵触的各个阶级为了不让自己和社会在无益的斗争中毁灭，需要一种权力站在社会之上（外表上！）来缓和这场冲突，并将其保持在‘秩序’的框架内。由此产生的这种权力虽然来自社会，却站在社会之上，并与社会日益成为外部事物，这就是国家。”这是恩格斯著名的国家规定，它在德国社会民主党内引起了许多混乱。“国家”在德国被视为一个根深蒂固的概念——至少看起来是这样——但恩格斯也解释了，在战斗的漩涡中处于特殊利益的各个阶级需要被召回到和平、秩序、理性和调解中，特别形成的制度就是以这种方式被理解的。 恩格斯在《家庭、私有财产及国家的起源》中，当他这样写的时候，对自己的国家规定进行了修正：“国家由于需要抑制阶级对立而产生，但同时它也是在这些阶级的冲突中产生的，一般来说，国家是最有力量、在经济上占支配地位的阶级的国家。这个阶级用国家作为政治上的支配工具，从而获得了新的手段来压迫和剥削被压迫阶级。”"},{"instruction":"请将“この論述は，なかんずく，かかる国家規定が階級分裂に基づくすべての生産様式，つまり奴隷制社会にも，封建社会やブルジョア社会にも有効であると主張しているがゆえに混乱と歪みを生じさせるのである。その上，エンゲルスは国家と国家装置を同一視しているため，古代国家についても封建国家についても，また資本による賃労働の搾取の道具である近代「代議制国家」についても同じように論じている。エンゲルスにとって，国家は，要するに，次の二つの指標によって特徴づけられる。その一つは，地域による国家成員の区分によってであり，いま一つは，一つの公的権力，すなわち，その権力の保持が国家市民の拠出金，つまり税金によってはかられる，常備軍，警察，行政官庁，裁判所の創設によってである。しかしながら，国家のそのような特徴づけはいまだ国家の特質を明らかにしないままであるし，悪い意味において，あまりにも抽象的なままである。だから，われわれが，〔上述の特徴づけによって〕一つの国家体制としての絶対君主制について初めて有意味に語りうるにせよ，エンゲルスは階級諸社会の歴史を通じて国家について語るという倒錯をみせているのである。しかしながら，絶対君主制において，国家装置はなんら階級対立を緩和するような制度ではなく，まったくそれと反対に，その助けを借りて完全な寄生階級が社会的剩余生産物への請求権を実現していくための制度なのである。 II マルクス「経済学体系プラン」における世界市場 1857年から1868年までに，マルクスは，ロスドルスキーがまとめたような，少なくとも14の草案と覚え書きを作成したのであるが，これらはマルクスの仕事の構成全体にかかわっている。その構成は，最初は，資本，土地所有，賃労働，国家，外国貿易と世界市場という六篇からなるはずであった。マルクスは，はじめの三篇を『資本論』三巻に包括しようと思っていた。しかしながら，マルクスの存命中には第1巻が世に出されただけであり，他の二巻は彼の死後，エンゲルスによって編纂され，出版された。残りの三篇については，今日にいたるまで，どんな手稿も諸断片も草稿も公にされていない。それゆえに，『資本論』や，その他の経済学的諸論文，とりわけ，いわゆる『資本論草稿』からの，欠損している理論総体の再構成が，くり返し，くり返し模索されてきた。社会主義運動の中で，まさに国家問題がもっとも重要課題の一つであったし，今もそうであるにもかかわらず，この再構成の作業は今日にいたるまで，この国家理論の部分においてもっとも成功していないのである。レーニンは，テキストの隠蔽にまでいきつく社会民主主義的歪曲に対して『国家と革命』をもって抵抗したのであるが，その体系的論証の中で，エンゲルスを拠りどころとしたのであり，そのことによって，一般化にあまりにも性急に足をふみ入れてしまったのである。この一般化は実践的には，たしかに必要なものであり，重要なものであった。また，この一般化が理論にその正当性を有していることも，いささかも否定されるべきではない。とはいえ，マルクス主義的国家理論の発展という点で，たんなる国家装置の諸機能の体系化を国家理論とするような，この一般化から出発することが方法論的に正当であるかどうかには疑問が残る。というのは，まさにマルクスの理論プランがつぎのことを示しているからである。つまり，マルクスが四番目のものとして国家篇を構想した時，国家装置の諸機能の単なる叙述以上のことを考えていたということである。 マルクスの体系においては，国家は思惟諸規定の展開の一つの具体化の段階としてあらわれる。いいかえれば，国家論は概念を媒介として現実性を獲得する一定の段階である。マルクスの思索は実践，変革にむけられていた。しかも，その構成員に，自己の機能メカニズムが，盲目的に自ら貫徹していく自然法則として映る，そのような社会においては，変革とは，単なる行動とか行為と同じ意味をもつものではけっしてなく，意識的な行動でなければならない。つまり，特定の時点に，特定の場所で，なにかを為す時に，何をなすべきか識っている，そのような行動でなければならない。マルクスの目的は，資本主義社会の自然法則理解に手掛りをつけることにあった。マルクスが『資本論』第一版の序文で述べているように，このことによって，実践がそもそも意識的なものになりうるのである。 「たとえ，ある社会がその運動の自然法則を探りだしたとしてもーそして近代社会の経済的運動法則を明らかにすることがこの著作の最終目的である-，その社会は自然的な発展の諸段階を跳び越えることも法令で取り除くこともできない。しかし，その社会は，分娩の苦痛を短かくし緩和することはできるの(14)である」。 マルクスは概念によって現実性を獲得する場合，叙述方法と研究方法を区別している。 「研究は，素材を細部にわたってわがものとし，素材のいろいろな発展形態を分析し，これらの発展形態の内的な紐帯を探りださなければならない。この仕事をすっかりすませてから，はじめて現実の運動をそれに応じて叙述することができるのである。これがうまくいって，素材の生命が観念的に反映するこア·ブリオリとになれば，まるで先験的な構成がなされているかのように見えるかもしれな(15)いのである」。 マルクスの研究方法は，「全体の混沌とした表象」から分析的に獲得される抽象的な規定を発展させることにある。さらに，マルクスの叙述の方法は，この抽象的な規定から「思考の道をとおって具体的なものの再生産に」導く。だから，理論の目的は諸規定や諸関係を内に含む具体的なるもの，具体的総体性，つまり，「多様性の統一」である。”翻译为中文","output":"这种说法尤其因为主张这样的国家规定对所有基于阶级分裂的生产方式有效——即对奴隶社会、封建社会和资产阶级社会同样有效——而导致混乱和扭曲。此外，恩格斯将国家和国家机构同一视之，因此对于古代国家、封建国家以及作为资本榨取雇佣劳动手段的现代“代议制国家”也是以相同方式论述的。对恩格斯来说，国家特征总的来说由两个指标定义：一是通过地区来区分国家成员，二是通过一个公权力的建立，即通过国家市民的税金来维系的常备军、警察、行政机关、法院的创建。然而，对国家如此特征的描述还没有明确国家的本质，且不幸地，在某种意义上过于抽象。因此，尽管我们只有首次通过上述特征描述绝对君主制作为一种国家体制才有意义，但恩格斯显示了一个谬误，即他以一种倒置的方式通过阶级社会的历史论述国家。然而，在绝对君主制下，国家机构根本不是一个缓和阶级对立的机构，而完全相反，借助于它，一个完全寄生的阶级实现了对社会剩余产品的索求。 II 马克思“经济学体系计划”中的世界市场 从1857年到1868年，马克思创作了至少14份草稿和备忘录，这些草稿和备忘录涉及他工作的整体结构。这个结构原本应当包括资本、土地所有权、雇佣劳动、国家、外国贸易和世界市场六部分。马克思原本计划将前三部分包括在《资本论》的三卷中。然而，在马克思生前，只有第一卷被发布，其他两卷则在他去世后由恩格斯编纂并出版。关于剩下的三部分，到今天为止，任何手稿或片段都未被公开发布。因此，一直在反复尝试从《资本论》及其它经济学论文，特别是所谓的《资本论草稿》中重构这一理论整体的缺失部分。尽管国家问题在社会主义运动中一直是最重要的议题之一，也仍然如此，但这种重构工作在国家理论部分至今最不成功。列宁曾用《国家与革命》来反对社会民主主义的歪曲，甚至包括文本的隐瞒，并在其中以恩格斯为依据进行体系化论证，因而过于急切地进入了一般化。这种概括在实践中确实是必要和重要的，也不应否认这种概括在理论上是正当的。然而，就马克思主义国家理论的发展而言，从这种仅将国家机构的各功能体系化即视为国家理论的概括出发，其方法论的正当性仍有疑问，因为正是马克思的理论计划表明了以下事实：当马克思设想国家篇作为第四部分时，他考虑的是超越了仅仅是国家机构各功能的叙述。 在马克思的体系中，国家作为思想规定发展的一个具体化阶段出现。换句话说，国家论是在某个阶段通过概念作为媒介获得现实性的。马克思的思考是面向实践、变革的。而且，在其成员看来，自身的功能机制呈现为一种盲目遵循的自然法则的社会中，变革决不仅仅是行为或行动的同义词，而必须是有意识的行动。也就是说，当在特定时间、特定地点做某事时，必须知道应该做什么的那种行动。马克思的目标是为理解资本主义社会的自然法则提供线索。如马克思在《资本论》第一版序言中所述，这使得行动本身首先可以成为有意识的。 “即使某个社会发现了其运动的自然法则——而揭示现代社会的经济运动法则是这部著作的最终目的——该社会也无法跳过或通过法令取消自然发展的各个阶段。但是，这个社会可以缩短并缓解分娩的疼痛。” 马克思在区分叙述方法和研究方法时，是在现实性通过概念获得时进行的。 “研究必须深入细节地掌握材料，并分析其各种发展形式，发掘这些发展形式的内在联系。只有完成了这项工作，才能按照对应地叙述现实的运动。如果这做得好，并且材料的生命以观念的形式得以反映，那么可能会看起来像是进行了先验的构造。” 马克思的研究方法在于：从“整体的混沌表象”分析性地获得抽象规定。此外，马克思的叙述方法是从这些抽象规定“通过思考路径导向具体事物的再生产”。因此，理论的目标是包含各规定和关系的具体性，即“多样性的统一”。"},{"instruction":"请将“「それゆえ，思考においては，それ（具体的なるもの）は総括の過程として，結果として現われるのであって，それが現実の出発点であり，したがってまた(16)直観と表象との出発点であるにもかかわらず，思考では出発点としては現われない」。構成案で構想されていたように，マルクスの理論は，この具体的総体性の展開の叙述として，つまり，抽象的な諸規定から出発して，概念によって具体的なものの再生産をめざす一つの過程として把握されねばならない。それゆえに，世界市場という概念のうちに具体的なるものはその最後の姿態にいたるのである。したがって世界市場は，実践を意識的なものにする包括された諸規定，概念の具体的総体性である。 国家概念はこの総体性が展開される途上の重要な一段階である。しかし，「国家」は国家装置の諸機能からなる一つの体系とはまったく異なったものである。なぜならば，商品生産が，具体的-有用労働の社会的分割にもとづいていないのと同様に，国家機能は「国家」と同一でないからである。それゆえに，マルクス主義国家理論はエンゲルスが発展させた一般化から出発しえないものである。このことは，資本主義的商品生産の叙述が，たとえば，工業内部あるいは資本主義社会内部の階層的構造から出発しえないのと同じである。つまり，かならずしもエンゲルス的一般化が誤りであるというわけではないが，ただこの一般化は国家理論にとっては，けっして本質的なものにはなりえないということである。 IIIマルクス主義国家理論の四つの分析レヴェル マルクス主義国家理論の課題を明らかにするためには，つぎの四つの分析レヴェルを識別することが有意義であるようにおもわれる。 1．自己自身と一致する資本，2．資本主義社会，3．マルクスが定式化したように，国家の形態でのブルジョア社会の総括，4．外国貿易と世界市場。このすべての具体化諸レヴェルに関連するもっとも重要な分析カテゴリーは，再生産カテゴリーである。 1．自己自身と一致する資本，あるいは，その概念に対応するような資本は，マルクスが『資本論』全三巻で叙述したような過程の分析を本質的に包括している。その場合，マルクスは資本主義的再生産体系を構成する決定的な社会原理，すなわち商品から出発する。商品と商品のもつ相対立する構成要素（使用価値と交換価値，具体的有用労働と抽象的人間労働，相対的価値形態と絶対的価値形態）が生産様式の矛盾内包的運動形態を規定する。剰余価値生産はこの運動形態に包摂される。マルクスの意図はつぎのことにあった。つまり，資本主義的生産様式は〔超歴史的〕自然的なものではなく，歴史的に成立したものであり，また歴史的に限界づけられているものであること，さらに，歴史の歯車が不可逆的なものであるはずだとすれば，この生産様式はより高度な生産様式に席を譲らなければならないということ，このようなことを証明するために，この生産様式の法則を発見することにマルクスの意図はあったのである。そもそも，そのような法則論的〔nomologisch］定式を展開しうるために，マルクスは理論的説明を加えるあらゆる段階において，再生産体系の機能メカニズムが均衡の状態にあるという立場をとる。価値，交換価値，あるいは生産価格そして市場価値というような概念は，均衡概念である。ここから，マルクスは，資本主義生産様式がその方向に導かれるにちがいなく，決して逆戻りすることのないような，不(17)均衡，不均等を分析する。 マルクスが生産様式の法則を定式化しようとしたとき，措定しなければならなかったこの前提は，資本主義的な生産過程が進行する中で，賃労働·資本関係がともに再生産されるというマルクス理論の基本的立場の一つにとって重要である。換言すれば，搾取関係としての賃労働-資本関係の維持にとって，経済的メカニズム，ほかならぬ資本主義的生産過程のメカニズム以外のどんなメカニズム（例えば，強制力など）も必要ではない。貨幣がすでに資本となってい(18)る場合，貨幣は「資本それ自体としてすでに新しい労働に割り当てられている」ことを意味する。資本家が「すでに資本として生きた労働に対立していたということが，彼が単に自己を資本として維持するばかりでなく，増大しつつある資本として，ますます大量に他人の労働を等価なしにわがものとするための，換言すれば，生きた労働力能に対立する資本としての資本の力，その存在をおしひろげ，他方で主観的な，実体を失った窮迫の状態にある生きた労働力能をたえず新たに生きた労働力能として生みだすための唯一の条件として表われる」。換言すれば，資本主義的再生産過程は，たんに商品，剩余価値を生産するだけではなく，資本関係自体を，つまり一方では資本家を，他方では賃労(20)働者を生産し，さらに再生産するということである。 「一方の極に労働条件が資本として現われ，他方の極に自分の労働力のほかには売るものがないという人間が現われることだけではまだ十分ではない。このような人間が自発的に自分を売らざるをえないようにすることだけでも，まだ十分ではない。資本主義的生産が進むにつれて，教育や伝統や慣習によってこの生産様式の諸要求を自明な自然法則として認める労働者階級が発展してくる。完成した資本主義的生産過程の組織はいっさいの抵抗をくじき，相対的過剰人口の不断の生産は労働の需要供給の法則を，したがってまた労賃を，資本の増殖欲求に適合する軌道内に保ち，経済的諸関係の無言の強制は労働者に対する資本家の支配を確定する。経済外的な直接的な強制力も相変らず用いられはするが，しかし例外的でしかない。事態が普通に進行するかぎり，労働者は『生産の自然法則』に任されたままでよい。すなわち，生産条件そのものから生じて，それによって保証され永久化されているところの資本への労働者の従属に任されたままでよい。資本主義的生産の歴史的生成期にはそうではなかった。興起しつつあるブルジョアジーは，労賃を『調節する』ために，すなわち利殖に好都合な枠のなかに労賃を押しこんでおくために，労働日を延長して労働者自身を正常な従属度に維持するために，国家権力を必要とし，利用する。これこそは，いわゆる本源的蓄積の一つの本質的な契機なのである」。 かくして，資本主義的再生産体系の機能メカニズムの均衡のもとでは，「賃労働と資本」という階級関係は，たんなる再生産過程を通して維持される。しかしながら，資本の分析レヴェル，より厳密にいえば稼動中の個別資本というマルクスが『資本論』三巻で到達したよりもはるかに具体的な分析レヴェルにおいては，再生産体系が均衡状態にあるということは絶対的な例外であり，偶然である。このレヴェルにおける通常な形態，通例は不均衡である。”翻译为中文","output":"“因此，在思考中，具体性作为总结过程，作为结果出现，尽管它是现实的起点，因此也是直觉和表象的起点，但在思考中它并不表现为起点。”正如构想案中所设想的那样，马克思的理论必须被理解为一个过程，即以抽象的规定为起点，通过概念努力再现具体事物的描述，这个具体的总体性的发展。因此，世界市场概念中的具体性达到其最终形态。因此，世界市场是实践变为有意识的行为的综合规定，是概念的具体总体性。 国家概念是这一总体性展开过程中的一个重要阶段。然而，“国家”与由国家机构的各个功能组成的系统完全不同。因为正如商品生产并非基于具体有用劳动的社会分割一样，国家功能也不与“国家”相同。因此，马克思主义国家理论不能从恩格斯发展的概括出发。这与资本主义商品生产的叙述无法从工业内部或资本主义社会内部的层级结构出发一样。这并不是说恩格斯式的概括就是错误的，而是这种概括对国家理论来说，绝不是本质的。 III 马克思主义国家理论的四个分析层次 为了明确马克思主义国家理论的任务，区分以下四个分析层次似乎是有意义的： 1. 与自身一致的资本，2. 资本主义社会，3. 如马克思所定义的，以国家形式总结的资产阶级社会，4. 对外贸易和世界市场。与所有这些具体化层次相关的最重要的分析范畴是再生产范畴。 1. 与自己一致的资本，或者说，与其概念相对应的资本，基本上包含了马克思在《资本论》全三卷中描述的过程分析。在这种情况下，马克思从商品这一决定性的社会原理出发构建资本主义再生产体系。商品及其具有矛盾性的组成部分（使用价值与交换价值，具体有用劳动与抽象人类劳动，相对价值形式与绝对价值形式）规定了生产方式的矛盾运动形式。剩余价值生产被这种运动形式所包含。马克思旨在证明资本主义生产方式并非[超历史的]自然事物，而是历史上形成的，因此受到历史限制；如果历史的齿轮是不可逆的，那么这种生产方式必须为更高级的生产方式让位。为了证明这一点，马克思旨在发现这种生产方式的规律。为了能够展开这种规律性[nomologisch]表述，马克思在理论解释的每一个阶段都采取了再生产体系处于平衡状态的立场。价值、交换价值、生产价格以及市场价值这样的概念是平衡概念。由此，马克思分析了资本主义生产方式无疑会被引向的、绝不会倒退的不平衡、不对等。 当马克思试图制定生产方式的规律时，他不得不设定的这个前提对于马克思理论的基本立场至关重要，即在资本主义生产过程中，雇佣劳动和资本关系都被再生产。换句话说，维持雇佣劳动与资本关系作为剥削关系，不需要任何经济机制，即资本主义生产过程的机制以外的任何机制（例如，强制力）。当货币已经成为资本时，这意味着“货币作为资本本身已经被分配给了新的劳动。”资本家“已经作为资本对立于活的劳动”意味着，他不仅仅是将自己维持为资本，而且作为日益增长的资本，越来越多地将他人的劳动无偿占为己有，换句话说，作为对立于活劳动力的资本的力量，扩展其存在，另一方面作为唯一的条件，不断地将处于主观上、实体上贫困状态的活劳动力重新生产为活劳动力。换言之，资本主义再生产过程不仅仅生产商品、剩余价值，还生产并再生产资本关系本身，即一方面生产资本家，另一方面生产雇佣劳动者。 “一方面，劳动条件以资本的形式出现，另一方面，除了自己的劳动力外没有其他东西可卖的人出现，这还不够。只是让这样的人自发地将自己出卖，也还不够。随着资本主义生产的发展，一个通过教育、传统和习俗接受这种生产方式的要求作为显而易见的自然法则的工人阶级将会发展出来。完成的资本主义生产过程的组织摧毁了一切抵抗，相对过剩人口的不断生产将劳动的供需法则，因此也将工资，保持在与资本的增长欲望相适应的轨道上，经济关系的沉默强制确立了资本家对工人的统治。还是会使用经济之外的直接强制力，但那是例外。只要事态正常进行，就可以把工人留给“生产的自然法则”，即留给由生产条件本身产生并由此确保永久化的工人对资本的从属。在资本主义生产的历史生成期并非如此。正在崛起的资产阶级需要并利用国家权力来“调节”工资，即将工资压制在利润最优化的框架内，通过延长工作日来维持工人在正常的从属地位，这是所谓原始积累的一个本质动因。” 因此，在资本主义再生产体系的功能机制平衡下，“劳动与资本”的阶级关系只是通过再生产过程维持。然而，在资本的分析层次上，更准确地说，在马克思在《资本论》第三卷达到的比个别资本运动更为具体的分析层次上，再生产体系处于平衡状态是绝对的例外，是偶然的。在这个层次上的常规形态、通常情况是不平衡的。"},{"instruction":"请将“2．第二の分析レヴェルは資本主義社会のそれである。これはより具体的なレヴェルである。つまり資本主義社会という概念は自らのうちに，法則論的なレヴェルをもつ。それゆえ資本主義社会は，さしあたってその概念に照応するような資本の機能メカニズムが文字通り作動するような社会として定義される。資本主義社会という概念は同時にそれ以上のものを内包している。より厳密にいえば，二通りの点でそうである。a）この概念は，一つの特定な再生産体系を表わす。b）この概念は，マルクスが自己自身と一致する資本を分析する場合に前提としていたような，たんなる二つの階級以上のものを包含している。つまり，一つの特定な再生産体系の中で行動するすべての階級や階層を包含している。 a）について。マルクスは『資本論』第二巻における再生産表式への序言的評言の中で，総資本の立場からみれば，ただ価値補塡を考察するだけではもはや不十分であることを強調している。社会的総資本の生産物においては，それらの現物形態での再生産の物的諸要素の一切が，この生産物の諸部分を形成しているといわねばならない。 「われわれが資本の価値生産や生産物価値を個別的に考察しているあいだは，商品生産物の現物形態は，たとえばそれが機械から成っていようと，穀物や鏡から成っていようと，分析にとっては，まったくどうでもよかった。（······）われわれが問題にしたのは，どの点でも一つの個別資本の過程として現われる直接的生産過程そのものだった。資本の再生産が考察にはいってきた限りでは，次のことを前提するだけで十分だった。すなわち，商品生産物のうち資本価値を表わす部分は，自分の生産要素に，したがってまた生産資本としての自分の姿に，再転化する機会を流通部門のなかで見いだすということを前提するだけで十分だった。それは，ちょうど，労働者も資本家も自分たちが労賃や剩余価値で買おうとする商品を市場で見いだすものと前提するだけでよかったのと同じことである。このようなただ形態的な説明の仕方は，社会的総資本とその生産物価値との考察ではもはや十分ではない。生産物価値の一部分が資本に再転化し，他の一部分が資本家階級と労働者階級との個人的消費にはいるということは総資本が結実した生産物価値そのもののなかでの運動を形成する。そして，この運動は価値補塡であるだけではなく素材補塡でもあり，したがって，社会的生産物のいろいろな価値成分の相互の割合によって制約されているとともに，それらの使用価値，それらの素材的な姿によっても制約されているのである」。 種々な生産行為者の社会的関係としての資本関係は，一つの歴史的に規定された関係であるが，可能な場合にいたる所に成立しうる歴史的な関係は，しかしながら，素材補塡を遂行するところの使用価値体系であって，それは自然的要素，つまりエネルギー資源，原料産出，気候条件等々に拘束される。総資本の再生産について考察する場合に，その体系の所持する自然諸条件に基づき，一定の使用価値の再生産を確実にしうる特定の再生産諸体系についてのみ有意味に語りうるのである。それゆえ，資本主義社会をここではまず，一定の自然諸条件に基づき，一定の使用価値構造をその商品生産の基礎として自由に処理しうる特定の再生産体系と定義しよう。第一義的，本質的な生産構造は賃労働と資本との関係によって定義されるのであり，それゆえ，この再生産体系は本質的に資本主義的諸関係の機能メカニズムによって規定されるのである。 b）について。マルクスは資本を分析する場合，資本の概念にふさわしいように，賃労働者と資本家というただ二つの階級から出発する。資本家階級とは剰余価値をわがものとし，それを自由に処分する階級であり，賃労働者とは剰余価値を生産する階級である。このわがものとする場合の仕方は再生産体系の機能メカニズムそれ自体によって与えられる。賃金労働者階級は次の二部門に分割される。その一つは本来の意味における剰余価値生産者であり，もう一つは剰余価値の実現過程で働く労働者である。この第二の部門の労働者は個別資本によって徹底的に生産的に消費されるのであるが，しかしながら総資本の立場からみれば非生産的な存在である。 剩余価値は，生産過程において生産されるにもかかわらず，社会の全剰余価値を生産的な資本家だけがわがものとするのではなく，彼らは，剩余価値実現化の局面で資本を投資した資本家と全剰余価値を分け合わなければならない。すなわち，社会的全剰余価値はさまざまな範疇の資本家に，つまり，生産的資本家，商業資本家そして貸し付け資本家（銀行家と信用供与者）に分配される。 階級構造のこのおおまかな区分はマルクスが『資本論』の中で展開したように，政治経済学の諸範疇から直接的に獲得されうる。しかしながら，資本主義社会はこの両階級より多くの階級を内に含んでいる。ここでとりわけ挙げられるべきは，資本に包摂されていないか，間接的にのみ包摂されている限りでの農民，手工業者，資本主義的に利用されない限りでのサーヴィス業（教育者，医者，法律家，芸術家など）である。このそれぞれ特定な再生産体系において，これらの階級や階層はある重要な機能をもつ。彼らの産み出す商品が資本としては機能しないが，社会的再生産過程における素材的姿態の重要な部分を生産するというかたちであれ，また，サーヴィス提供が収入の消費として単純流通を通して現出するというかたちであれ。特定の再生産体系において，一つの重要な機能をにないうるこれらの階級や階層のもつ意義は，社会的総資本や一つの運動としての再生産に対する彼らの地位から生じるのであって，資本の価値諸要素ならびに素材的姿態，すなわち社会の使用価値体系を補塡するという地位から生じるのである。 そうであるなら，これらの階級や階層を賃労働-資本関係の単なる付属物とみなすことはまちがいであろう。というのは，所与の再生産体系において，資本関係の拡張がどの程度まで有意義なのか，すなわちこれらの生産ないしはサーヴィス領域における資本の価値増殖が，そもそもどの程度収益(23)的であるかを，これらの階級や階層の存在がまさに示すものなのだからである。”翻译为中文","output":"2. 第二分析层次是资本主义社会。这是一个更具体的层次。换言之，资本主义社会这一概念本身具有法则性层次。因此，资本主义社会首先可以被定义为一个资本的功能机制实际运作的社会，即该社会的概念直接对应于资本的功能。资本主义社会这一概念同时还包含了更多内容。更准确地说，有两方面：a) 该概念代表一个特定的再生产体系；b) 该概念包含了超过仅有的两个阶级的内容，正如马克思在分析与自身一致的资本时所前提的。也就是说，包括在一个特定再生产体系中行动的所有阶级和阶层。 关于a)。马克思在《资本论》第二卷中关于再生产方案的导言性评论中强调说，从总资本的角度来看，仅仅考虑价值补偿是不够的。在社会总资本的产品中，必须表明所有的物质要素，即这些产品的部分，以其物质形式进行再生产。 “当我们单独考虑资本的价值产生和产品价值时，商品产品的物质形态无论是机器，还是谷物或镜子，在分析中，这完全无关紧要。（......）我们关心的是直接作为个别资本过程出现的直接生产过程本身。一旦资本的再生产被纳入考虑，假设商品产品中表现为资本价值的部分能够在流通部门中找到机会，转变回自己的生产要素，因此回归自身作为生产资本的形态，这样的假设就足够了。这正如只需要假设工人和资本家在市场上能找到他们想用工资或剩余价值购买的商品一样。这种仅形式上的解释方式在考察社会总资本及其产品价值时已不再足够。产品价值的一部分重新转化为资本，另一部分进入资本家阶级和工人阶级的个人消费，这构成了总资本结出的产品价值内部运动的形式。而且，这种运动不仅是价值补偿，也是物质补偿，因此，受到社会生产物的各种价值成分之间相互比例的限制，以及它们的使用价值、物质形态的限制。” 作为社会生产行为者的资本关系是一个历史上规定的关系，但尽管如此，可能在任何地方建立的历史关系实际上是执行物质补偿的使用价值体系，它被自然要素，即能源资源、原材料产出、气候条件等所限制。在考虑总资本的再生产时，仅仅具有特定再生产体系的自然条件，才有意义地讨论确保特定使用价值再生产的可能性。因此，这里首先将资本主义社会定义为根据特定的自然条件，自由处理一定的使用价值结构作为其商品生产基础的特定再生产体系。首要的、本质的生产结构由雇佣劳动与资本的关系定义，因此，这一再生产体系本质上由资本主义关系的功能机制所规定。 关于b)。马克思在分析资本时，从对应于资本概念的仅两个阶级——雇佣劳工和资本家——出发。资本家阶级是占有并自由支配剩余价值的阶级，而雇佣劳动者是生产剩余价值的阶级。这种占有形式由再生产体系的功能机制本身赋予。雇佣劳动者阶级被分为两个部门：一是本质意义上的剩余价值生产者，另一个是在剩余价值实现过程中工作的劳动者。这第二部门的劳动者被个别资本彻底生产性地消费，但是，从总资本的立场来看，他们是非生产性存在。 剩余价值虽然在生产过程中产生，但社会的全部剩余价值并非仅由生产性资本家占有；他们必须在剩余价值实现阶段与投资资本的资本家分享全部剩余价值。也就是说，社会总剩余价值分配给各种类别的资本家，即生产性资本家、商业资本家以及贷款资本家（银行家和信用提供者）。 这种阶级结构的大致划分是马克思在《资本论》中展开的，可以直接从政治经济学的范畴中获得。然而，资本主义社会包含的阶级远不止这两个。特别值得一提的是，农民、手工业者、未被资本主义所利用的服务业（如教育工作者、医生、律师、艺术家等），这些未被资本包含或仅间接被包含。在这一特定的再生产体系中，这些阶级或阶层担任某些重要功能，无论是以生产资本无法功能的商品的形式，还是以提供的服务作为收入消费以简单流通形式出现。这些阶级或阶层在特定的再生产体系中扮演重要功能的意义，来源于它们对于社会总资本或再生产作为一种运动的地位，及其补偿资本的价值要素和物质形态，即社会使用价值体系的地位。因此，将这些阶级或层次仅视为雇佣劳动-资本关系的附属物是错误的。这是因为它们的存在恰恰表明，给定再生产体系中资本关系的扩展到何种程度是有意义的，即这些生产或服务领域中资本价值增长的收益性到底有多大。"},{"instruction":"请将“3．自己自身と一致する資本の機能メカニズム，〔ついで〕価値ならびに素材補塡を遂行し，種々の階級や階層構造を内包する特定の再生産体系〔という認識］を背景に，われわれは今や，より具体的な分析レヴェルに到達する。われわれは，このレヴェルをマルクスとともに，国家の形態でのブルジョア社会の総括と呼ぶ。すでにわれわれは，冒頭で絶対君主制下での近代的国家装置の成立に注意を促した。それはそこで古い封建階級のために，社会的剰余生産物へのその請求権を実現してやるという機能を持っていた。ブルジョアジーは，封建的ガラクタを一掃するのに成功した後-成功しえなかった国も多くあったのではあるが-，その国家装置を自らの目的のために利用することになる。資本関係がより普遍的なものへと発展すればするほど，国家装置は社会的剰余価値の獲得体系としてはあまり作動しなくなった。それとは逆に，資本関係の展開が少なければ少ないほど，それだけ一層国家装置はつぎのような課題を負うこととなる。つまり，国家装置をコントロール下におくのに成功したブルジョアジーの諸分派に剩余生産物を周旋するという課題，あるいはまだ剩余生産物が生産されていない場合には少なくとも将来の剰余生産物への保証〔kredit〕(24)を与えるという課題である。 過去のあらゆる搾取社会とは反対に，資本主義社会はけっして生産者の直接的な抑圧に基づいていないし，搾取者は剩余生産物をわがものとするために直接的な暴力を用いはしない。すでに提示されたように，賃労働者-資本家という階級関係は資本主義的再生産過程そのものを通して再生産されるのである。賃労働者が，それ自体再び資本として作動する商品を生産する過程で，賃労働者はたんに商品を生産するだけではなく，つまり不変資本の商品価値を再生産し，新しい価値，すなわちvk＋mを生産するだけではなく，同時に，資本とそれに伴って賃労働者としての自分自身の地位をも生産するのである。つまり，資本主義的再生産過程は同時に，社会的な視点からすれば-このことはもっとも重要なことだが-搾取関係の再生産過程でもあるということである。もちろん，こうした事態は，ただ総資本の再生産過程が支障なく経過する場合，つまりこの過程が均衡状態にある場合にのみ妥当する。しかしながら，再生産体系のこのような均衡は例外的なものであり，偶然である。つまり，常態は不均衡である。この不均衡は恐慌においてはじめて表現されるといったようなものではなく，常に再生産過程に付随するものであり，ただし，恐慌の中においてのみ激化するものなのである。恐慌とは，そもそも資本主義的商品生産から必然的にもたらされた再生産過程の不均衡状態を再び均衡へ導くという機能をもっているものなのである。換言すれば，その価値にふさわしい形での商品交換は資本主義においては一つの擬制的仮定にすぎない。つまり，商品価値はそもそも経験的に確定されたいかなる大きさなども持ってはいない。経験的に，すなわち市場において確めうるものは，市場価値をめぐって振動する市場価格である。市場価値は，それ自体平均的価値であり，それゆえけっして個々の商品価値を表現してはいない。再生産過程の均衡状態は，再生産を規制する合理的な契機，つまり商品の価値が，かつてエンゲルスが定式化したように，参加者の無意識状態に基づく盲目的自然法則として貫徹されるような一つの社会では，一つのあ(25)だな望みにおわらざるをえない。 それゆえ，われわれが賃労働-資本関係はその関係そのものを通して自らを再生産するという時，再生産過程の均衡状態を前提としているのである。このような前提は全体としての景気循環については現実的である。というのは，その循環の初めと終りに恐慌が現出するからである。初めに現出する恐慌は修復された均衡を，もう一つは修復されるべき均衡を意味するからである。このように再生産体系の均衡はたしかに恐慌によって再び正しい状態になりうるのであるが，それにもかかわらず，均衡状態は循環の現実の流れにとってはやはり例外的なものでありつづける。しかしながら，恐慌そのものは資本の価値増殖の論理や資本の等価交換に基づく運動諸形態への著しい侵害である。とりわけ資本諸関係の機能メカニズムがはなはだしくかきみだされるほどの危機状況においては，資本家階級は，賃労働-資本関係のかき乱された再生産機構を部分的に代行する制度，個別資本の諸利害を無視して全体として搾取社会の維持を保証すべき制度を必要とするのである。そしてこの制度とは，軍隊，警察，司法部，国家的救済基金等を具備した一つの装置である。 危機〔恐慌〕においては資本主義的商品生産の矛盾は先鋭化するものであるとしても，この矛盾は不断に作用するものであるから，この矛盾が再生産体系の機能メカニズムそのものによって規制されえない場合には，エンゲルスが定式化したように，「観念的な総資本家」として作用する国家装置の諸制度を通じて規制されなければならないのである。国家装置の持つこの課題-再生産過程が攪乱された場合に，賃労働者階級に対する資本家階級の業務を遂行するという-は恒常的に設定されている。資本主義には経済的恐慌のような一時的な混乱と並んで，絶えず資本主義的再生産過程の構造的諸混乱が存在してきた。つまり，資本には直接的に包摂されない国家諸制度によってのみ充足されうる諸課題がたえず存在してきた。このような課題としてとりわけ賃労働者の養成，賃労働者への医学的配慮，そして労働者の文化的，宗教的欲求の充足があげられる。再生産過程の矛盾と攪乱が，たんに賃労働と資本との関係においてのみではなく，その他の階級や階層間においてもまた現出することはいうまでもない。”翻译为中文","output":"3. 在自足资本的功能机制、执行价值和物质补偿的特定再生产体系（这一认识）的背景下，包含各种阶级和阶层结构，我们现在达到了一个更具体的分析层次。我们与马克思一起将此层次称为资产阶级社会以国家形式的总结。我们已经注意到，在绝对君主制下现代国家机构的形成。它在那里为旧封建阶级实现社会剩余产品的索取权起到了作用。资产阶级在扫除封建废墟后——尽管并非所有国家都能成功——将这一国家机构用于其自己的目的。随着资本关系向更普遍的形式发展，国家机构作为社会剩余价值获取体系的作用减弱。相反，资本关系发展得越少，国家机构就越是承担以下任务：即为成功将国家机构置于控制之下的资产阶级各派系周旋剩余产品，或者在剩余产品尚未生产的情况下，至少提供对未来剩余产品的保证。 与所有过去的剥削社会相反，资本主义社会绝不是基于对生产者的直接压迫，剥削者也不使用直接暴力来占有剩余产品。正如已经指出的，雇佣劳动者-资本家之间的阶级关系是通过资本主义再生产过程本身来再生产的。在生产作为再次作为资本运作的商品的过程中，雇佣工人不仅仅生产商品，也就是说，不仅仅再生产不变资本的商品价值并产生新价值，即v+k+m，而且同时生产资本以及伴随而来的自身作为雇佣劳动者的地位。也就是说，资本主义再生产过程同时也是——从社会角度来看－这是最重要的－剥削关系再生产过程。当然，这种情况仅在总资本的再生产过程顺利进行，即这一过程处于平衡状态时才成立。然而，这种再生产体系的平衡是例外的，是偶然的。换言之，常态是不平衡的。这种不平衡不是只有在恐慌中才会表现出来，而是一直伴随再生产过程，只是在恐慌中加剧。恐慌本质上是由资本主义商品生产导致的再生产过程的不平衡状态，其功能是将这种不平衡状态重新导向平衡。换言之，以其价值所对应的形式进行商品交换在资本主义中只是一种假定的假设。即商品价值本身并不具有任何经验性确定的量。在市场上能够经验性确认的是围绕市场价值波动的市场价格。市场价值本身是平均价值，因而绝不代表个别商品的价值。再生产过程的平衡状态，在一个社会中，商品价值作为参与者基于无意识状态的盲目自然法则得以实现，这种平衡成为一种渴望。 因此，当我们说雇佣劳动-资本关系通过其自身关系再生产自身时，我们是假设再生产过程处于平衡状态。这种假设对整体经济周期是现实的，因为在周期的开始和结束都会出现恐慌。开始出现的恐慌代表恢复的平衡，另一个代表需恢复的平衡。因此，再生产体系的平衡确实可以通过恐慌重新达到正确状态，尽管如此，平衡状态对循环的实际流动仍然是例外。然而，恐慌本身对资本价值增长逻辑和资本等价交换的运动形态构成了显著的侵犯。在危机情况下，特别是当资本家阶级的功能机制被严重干扰时，资本家阶级需要一个能部分代替雇佣劳动-资本关系混乱再生产机制的体制，不考虑个别资本的利益，确保作为整体的剥削社会的维持。这个体制包括配备有军队、警察、司法部、国家救济基金等装置。 即使在恐慌中资本主义商品生产的矛盾加剧，但由于这些矛盾始终存在，且如果这些矛盾不能由再生产体系的功能机制自身调节，那么就必须通过国家装置的各种制度来调节，就像恩格斯所表述的那样，作为“理想总资本家”行动。国家装置承担的这一任务——在再生产过程受到干扰时执行资本家阶级对雇佣工人阶级的职责——是永久设定的。资本主义既有经济恐慌这样的暂时混乱，也一直存在着资本主义再生产过程的结构性混乱。即有一直存在着只能通过国家机构直接包含的各种任务。特别是，雇佣工人的培训、医疗护理以及满足工人的文化和宗教需求等任务可以提到。不必说，再生产过程的矛盾和干扰不仅仅在雇佣劳动和资本关系中表现出来，也在其他阶级或阶层之间表现出来。"},{"instruction":"请将“国家の形態によるブルジョア社会の総括について語る場合，われわれが想定しているのはつぎのようなある再生産体系である。それは第一に特定の使用価値体系に基づくそれであり，第二に賃労働と資本関係が支配的な特定の階級構造によって，つまり，資本主義的再生産過程の機能メカニズムによって基本的に規定されるそれであり，第三に，特定の再生産体系の機能メカニズムにおける攪乱を搾取者総体の利益のために規制する強制的な性格を持った諸制度の体系である。たんに国家装置の機能のみ叙述し，区分けしていく国家理論ではブルジョアー的資本家的社会のつぎのような本質的な点を見すごすことになる。つまり，1．この制度は相対的に重要性を持たないのが通例であること，2．国家的諸制度は，それらが資本主義的再生産過程における諸機能障害を除去しうる立場にある場合にのみ，発展ないし存続されうることである。再生産体系における諸機能障害は，いずれにせよ，資本関係そのものの，その概念にふさわしい形での諸障害によってだけではなく，階級構造における諸変化，ならびに使用価値体系の再生産の変化によっても惹き起こされるのである。かかる視点を背景にしてはじめて，国家的諸制度の諸機能の有意味な分析が可能となるのである。つまり，その時々に特定な再生産体系についての概念をあらかじめ獲得している場合にのみ，国家諸機能に定義を下すことが可能になるのであって，その逆ではありえない。なぜならば，国家概念はけっして国家装置概念とは同一ではないからである。概念を媒介として現実性をわがものとしていく過程での具象化諸範疇として，前段階の，より抽象的な概念次元の諸規定は国家概念のうちに止揚されていなければならない。 これまでは自ら価値ならびに素材補塡をなしうるその時々に存在する再生産体系から出発した。そして国家概念はこのような前提のもとで規定された。それにもかかわらずこの想定それ自体が一つの抽象である。なぜならば，どんなブルジョア国家も社会的再生産を自分自身だけでは遂行しえなかったし，現在もしえないからであり，つまり，多かれ少なかれすべてのブルジョア国家は外国貿易に依存しているからである。 4．ここで外国貿易という言葉で考えられているのは，一つの独自な再生産体系としての国家を起点とするのではあるが，その国家内部においてではなく，他の特定の再生産体系と世界市場上で実施される交換の側面である。われわれは世界市場について，マルクスにしたがって，労働の生産力がさまざまな発展水準にある，さまざまな再生産体系の統合であると理解する。しかしながら資本主義的世界市場の唯物論的理論の見取図はこれまでのところ描かれていない。東ヨーロッパの諸人民共和国のマルクス主義者達に対して，「経済相互援助会議〔コメコン〕」（RGW）の発展にともない，まずもってつぎのような実践的問題がつきつけられるに至った。つまり，いかなる経済的基準にしたがって，人民共和国間で交換される商品の価格確定がなされるべきかという問題である。彼らにとって世界市場という問題は理論的には〔同盟国間におけるそれにとどまらず〕資本主義的世界市場にまでますます拡大されていく外国貿易における商品価格の客観的な確定という問題として設定される。 1962年にギュンター·コールメイはある論文で，両世界貿易体系の問題について論究した。彼はマルクスがとりわけ『資本論』第一巻と第三巻のさまざまな箇所において，練り上げられるべき世界市場理論に関する基本的な言表をおこなっていることに注意を促している。このような世界市場理論の基礎にあるのは，もちろん本質的な修正はくわえられるとしても国際的価値の理論である。 さて，資本主義的世界市場創出への傾向は資本の無限定性に内在的なものである。外国貿易は，使用価値体系の一国的枠組みを克服し，生産を拡大し分化させ，かくして蓄積過程の本質的一要因をなす。ここでひとまず国際的価値がまぬがれない諸修正を度外視すれば，世界市場において交換される商品の交換価値は，これら商品の価値量によって規定される。 「世界市場で売却される商品の価値量は，世界市場において出現する通常の需要に応ずるのに社会的に必要な労働時間によって規定される。」 世界市場はけっして統一的な再生産体系ではなく，各々特定な再生産諸体系の統合された体系であるから，「世界貿易商品の国際的価値量は，諸国際市場(28)で商なわれるすべての商品のもつ一国家的価値の計量された平均である」。「厳密にとれば，外国貿易で取引される商品および商品集団のみが，国際的価値をもつ。なぜなら，それらだけが国際的市場を通して流通〔Kommunikation〕に入るからである。それに対し海外貿易で取引されていないすべての商品と，なるほど世界貿易商品ではあるが国際的には取引されていない商品の一部は，一国的かあるいはたんなる地域的に規定された価値量をもっにすぎない。それにもかかわらず，〔この両者には〕連関，相互作用および相互規定が存在しているのは自明なことである。なぜならば，国際的価値量は世界貿易に関与している一国的価値量に依存しているし，逆に，世界市場が国内の再生産過程に程度の差はあれ強くあるいは決定的にさえ影響を与えるように，国際的価値量は一国的価値量に大きな影響を与えている。それに加えて各々の再生産過程の中で他の多くの商品の価値が個々の商品に転換されるので，ほぼすべての商品はその生産に必要な機械，材料等の一国的価値量と国際的な価値量の複合物を吸い上げることになるからである。それゆえに価値量の世界においては，地域的平均から一国的そして限定された国際的，さらに全地球的な国際的な平均への全階梯が存在する。マルクスによれば，『一国的平均は，それゆえ，その度量単位(29)が普遍的労働の平均単位であるような階梯を形成する』」。 まさに帝国主義段階にある世界市場の展開における特徴は，一国的価値量がより広範に，不均一に運動するということ，さらに，各国の資本主義の生産性における相異が増幅されるということにある。そもそも世界市場での交換は，特定の商品単位〔Warenquant〕がさまざまな価値量で交換されることを意味するのであり，あるいは，さまざまな商品単位は相異なった再生産体系における労働生産力の生産性の相異に基づいてまったく同一の価値量を示すということである。つまり，一つの再生産体系内部において平均化運動が競争の強制法則を通じて商品単位〔Wareneinheiten〕ごとに価値量の確定における相異を次第に平均化していく一方で，各国の価値量は資本主義的世界市場においては，ますます分化してくるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"3. 当我们谈论以国家形态总结的资产阶级社会时，我们所设想的是如下的再生产体系。首先，它基于特定的使用价值体系；其次，由资本与雇佣劳动关系支配的特定阶级结构基本定义，即通过资本主义再生产过程的功能机制定义；第三，为了榨取者整体的利益调节特定再生产体系功能机制中的干扰而具有强制性质的制度体系。仅描述国家机构的功能并对其进行分类的国家理论会忽视资产阶级资本家社会如下的本质方面。即：1. 这些制度通常具有相对不重要的性质；2. 国家制度只能在它们能够消除资本主义再生产过程中的功能障碍时才得以发展或存在。再生产体系中的功能障碍不仅仅由资本关系本身的适用其概念的障碍引起，而且还由阶级结构的变化以及使用价值体系的再生产变化引起。只有在这样的视角背景下，对国家制度的功能进行有意义的分析才成为可能。即，只有在事先获得特定再生产体系概念的情况下，才能对国家功能下定义，反之则不可能。因为国家概念决不与国家机构概念相同。在通过概念作为媒介来掌握现实性的过程中，作为具体化分类的前阶段，更抽象概念层面的规定必须在国家概念中得到吸收。 迄今为止，我们出发点总是特定的能够完成价值补偿和物质补偿的再生产体系。国家概念是在这种前提下定义的。然而，这种假设本身就是一种抽象。因为任何资产阶级国家都无法仅凭自身完成社会再生产，现在也不能，这意味着所有资产阶级国家或多或少地依赖于外国贸易。 4. 我们在这里考虑的外国贸易，虽然以国家作为独特再生产体系的起点，但不是在国家内部进行，而是在与其他特定再生产体系和世界市场上进行的交换方面。我们根据马克思的理解，将世界市场视为各种发展水平的劳动生产力、各种再生产体系的整合。然而，到目前为止，资本主义世界市场的唯物论理论尚未被描绘出来。对于东欧各人民共和国的马克思主义者来说，随着“经济互助理事会”（RGW）的发展，首先提出了如下的实践问题。即，应当根据何种经济标准来确定人民共和国之间交换的商品的价格。对他们而言，世界市场问题在理论上被设定为一个问题，即不仅限于盟国间，而是越来越扩大到资本主义世界市场的外国贸易中商品价格的客观确定问题。 1962年，Günter Kohlmey在一篇文章中研究了两个世界贸易体系的问题。他指出马克思特别在《资本论》第一卷和第三卷的不同部分中，进行了应当被发展的世界市场理论的基本论述。这样的世界市场理论的基础当然是国际价值理论，尽管可能会进行本质修正。 资本主义世界市场的形成趋势是资本无限性的内在特性。外国贸易通过克服使用价值体系的国家框架，扩大并分化生产，从而构成积累过程的本质要素。如果我们暂且不考虑国际价值不可避免的修正，那么在世界市场上交换的商品的交换价值由这些商品的价值量决定。 “在世界市场上销售的商品的价值量是由在世界市场上出现的正常需求所需的社会必要劳动时间决定的。” 世界市场绝不是一个统一的再生产体系，而是各个特定再生产体系的综合体，因此，“国际商品的国际价值量是作为各个国家市场上交易的所有商品的国家价值的加权平均。” “严格来说，只有在外国贸易中交易的商品和商品群才具有国际价值。因为，只有它们才通过国际市场进入流通。相反，所有没有在海外贸易中交易的商品和部分世界贸易商品，即使没有国际交易，它们的价值量仅仅是国家性的或仅仅是区域性的。然而，存在联系、互动和相互决定是显而易见的，因为国际价值量依赖于参与世界贸易的国家价值量，反之，世界市场在程度上有强烈或甚至决定性地影响国内再生产过程，国际价值量对国家价值量产生重大影响。加之，由于许多其他商品的价值转化为个别商品，在每个再生产过程中，几乎所有商品都会吸收其生产所需的机器、材料等的国家价值量和国际价值量的组合。因此，在价值量的世界中，存在从地区平均到国家和有限的国际、甚至全球的国际平均的整个阶梯。按照马克思的说法，‘国家平均因此形成一个阶梯，其度量单位是全球劳动的平均单位’”。 世界市场在帝国主义阶段的发展特点在于，国家价值量更广泛、不均匀地运动，进一步，各国资本主义生产力的差异被放大。本质上，世界市场上的交换意味着特定商品量以不同的价值量交换，或者，不同的商品量基于各个再生产体系中劳动生产力生产力的差异展示完全相同的价值量。换句话说，尽管在一个再生产体系内部的平均化运动通过竞争的强制法则逐渐平均化商品单位的价值量确定中的差异，但在资本主义世界市场上，各国的价值量正在变得越来越分化。"},{"instruction":"请将“「帝国主義の時代には，技術-経済的に発展した国とそうでない国との間の生産性の相異が減少するのではなく拡大するので，それに対応して，各国間の価値量の相異も少なくなるのではなく増大する。それに応じて，国際的価値での交換は（······）ますます労働経費〔Arbeitsaufwendung］が資本主義的世界経済の従属地域から支配的諸国へと振り当てられていくことを意味するようになるであろう。これが帝国主義的世界経済発展の本質的特徴である。国際的価値のもとでの等価交換という単純な命題によっては，帝国主義的世界経済のこの本質的な標識は曖昧にされることはあっても明らかにはされないだろう」。 各国の再生産体系において価値量が異なるというこの傾向は本質的に資本主義的世界市場の構造によって規定される。 一原料産出諸国の工業国への依存。 一工業諸国の独占利潤を実現する可能性。 -50年代の初頭いらい原料産出国を不利にしている交易条件（Terms of Tra-de）の発展。 一他諸国に対する，より生産力の高い国に利得を創出すべく確定された為替相場体系。これが成立すれば，価値量の減少が生産性の高い国の商品価格ないしは為替相場に反映しないからである。 ーそして，とりわけ資本主義工業諸国の資本輸出。 これらすべての諸要因が世界市場における価値法則の作用に影響を与えるのである。それもけっして市場価値ないしは生産価格の確立が価値法則に修正を加えるという意味においてだけではない。世界市場における価値法則の修正は外国貿易や世界市場の理論に固有な問題である。その場合，コールメイが提示したように，なるほど労働生産性の発展が国によって相異しているという事情から出発しなければならないとしても，中心的理論問題はやはり世界市場における価値法則の作用の仕方，ならびに，それが，まさに修正されながらも貫徹していくあり方を叙述することにある。そして，この修正を分析する場合にすでに前提されているのが特定の再生産体系としての国家の理論である。もちろんここでは世界市場の理論は展開されえない。だから唯物論的国家理論の獲得にとって，〔それに対する〕世界市場の影響は例証として，ほんの要約的に示唆されるべきである。 外国貿易の進行形態は国家諸制度の体系に作用し，その構造を変える。われわれはヒルファーディングにしたがって外国貿易をつぎの三つの形態に区分する。1．商品の輸出入，2．貸付資本の輸出入，3．生産物資本の輸出入。上で定式化した，外国貿易の形態が国家形態それ自体を規定しうるという命題を説明するために，その例証としてロシアとドイツに言及しよう。とりわけ世紀転換点以後のロシアの発展は，フランス，ベルギー，ドイツならびにイングランドからの貸付資本の輸入なしには考えられない。ロシア国家はたんにその軍事装置，戦争，そして紛争にだけではなく，もっとも重要な社会設備（鉄道など）にも，パリの株式市場で高金利で取り引きされた西ヨーロッパの借款によって資金を調達した。貸付資本の輸出国，ここではとりわけフランスのブルジョアジーは彼らのロシアへの資本投下のゆえにツァーリズム体制の存続につよい利害関心をよせていた。なぜならば，高収益や投資の安全は，ツァーリ国家によってしか保証されなかったからである。こうした外国貿易の国家形態への影響は，ロシアへの貸付資本の例証によって示されうるように，〔被資本輸入国に］受動的にのみ与えられるものはない。それどころか外国貿易の形態は資本輸出国の国家形態にも作用するのである。この事態は，植民地体系と勢力範囲の世界分割において劣勢であった国々においてもっとも顕著に現われる。われわれはここで，とりわけドイツの事情を想起している。豊富な原料資源や安価な労働力などを所有する国々に資本を生産的に投資するという必然性は，資本主義的蓄積過程の論理からもたらされる。生産的投資とは，投資国によって多かれ少なかれ支配されている国々においてのみ，長期にわたってなされる投資である。これが植民地体系創設の決定的な根拠である。しかしながら，ドイツのように，高度な資本の有機的構成のゆえに，価値増殖が困難な状況に陥っている国々が，それにもかかわらず生産的資本を広範囲に輸出する可能性をもっていない場合，そうした国々は遅かれ早かれ，すでに分割の完了した資本投下範囲，勢力範囲の再分割をめざすようになる。この再分割は通常，強力によってはじめて遂行されうるのである。そこで，当該諸国の国家制度や国家形態の内部構造は，他の帝国主義諸勢力との武力対決を遂行しうるように形成されなければならなくなる。ここに叙述したような事態は，ヴィルヘルム二世時代のドイツや，そしてとりわけドイツのファシズムの例によって実証される。外国貿易の形態-ここでは生産的資本の輸出の必然性-は，国家形態の変化や，特定な再生産(33)体系としての国家の変化を生じせしめるのである。 B 独占メカニズムへの論理 I 利潤率の平均化と生産力発展との矛盾 われわれは国家を特定の再生産体系と定義した時，マルクスが自由競争の諸条件として定式化したような様式で資本の機能メカニズムは作動するということから出発した。それゆえに，種々の生産セクターの利潤率は競争の強制法則に基づいて，一つの平均利潤率に調整されていく。そもそも利潤率の相異は本質的にそれぞれのセクターでの資本の有機的構成の高さの相異からもたらされる。個別資本は，たえず最高の利潤率を得ようとつとめるので，自由競争の諸条件のもとでは一つの均衡化運動が生ずるのであるが，その結果，著しい変動ともっとも苛酷な競争的闘争の下で一つの平均利潤率が確立される。このことによって，個々に生みだされる剩余価値量はそれぞれの〔個別〕資本の有機的構成の相異に応じて種々な量をとるにもかかわらず，同じ大きさの前貸しされた各資本は同じ大きさの利潤量をかせぎ出すことが保証される。それゆえ，費用価格と平均利潤によって構成されるある商品の生産価格という概念には，前貸しされた資本量に応じての社会的総剰余価値の分割されたものが包含されている。平均利潤率は持続的な平衡化過程の結果として成立する。マルクスはこの事情についてつぎのように叙述している。”翻译为中文","output":"在帝国主义时代，技术和经济上发达的国家与那些未发达国家之间的生产率差异不是缩小而是扩大了，相应地，各国之间的价值量差异也不是减少而是增加。因此，国际价值的交换将（......）更多地将劳动成本从资本主义世界经济的从属地区转向主导国家。这是帝国主义世界经济发展的本质特征。简单的等价交换这一命题下的国际价值并不能澄清帝国主义世界经济的这一本质特征，最多只能使其模糊。 这种各国再生产体系中的价值量差异的趋势本质上是由资本主义世界市场的结构所决定的。 一原料输出国对工业国的依赖。 一工业国实现垄断利润的可能性。 - 50年代初原料输出国不利的贸易条件（Terms of Trade）的发展。 一为了创造更高生产力国家的利益而确定的汇率体系。这样一来，价值量的减少就不会反映在生产力高的国家的商品价格或汇率上。 一特别是资本主义工业国的资本输出。 所有这些因素都影响了世界市场上价值规律的作用。这不仅仅是因为市场价值或生产价格的确立对价值规律进行了修正。世界市场上的价值规律的修正是外国贸易和世界市场理论中特有的问题。在这种情况下，如Kohlmei所展示的，即使从国家之间劳动生产力的发展存在差异这一事实出发，核心理论问题仍然在于描述世界市场上价值规律的作用方式，以及它是如何在修正中仍然被执行的。而分析这种修正时已经默认了特定再生产体系即国家理论。当然，在这里不能展开世界市场理论。因此，对唯物主义国家理论的获得，世界市场的影响应该作为例证，仅以概括性的提示呈现。 外国贸易的进行方式作用于国家机构体系并改变其结构。我们根据Hilferding的分类，将外国贸易分为三种形式：1.商品的进出口，2.贷款资本的进出口，3.生产资本的进出口。为了解释上述外国贸易形式可以决定国家形态本身的命题，我们举俄国和德国为例。特别是世纪之交以后的俄国发展，离不开来自法国，比利时，德国以及英国的贷款资本输入。俄国国家不仅为其军事装备、战争和冲突筹资，还为最重要的社会设施（例如铁路）通过巴黎股票市场上的高利率西欧贷款筹集资金。贷款资本输出国，这里特指法国的资产阶级，对其对俄国的资本投资抱有强烈的利益关注，因为高收益和投资安全只能由沙皇政府保证。如俄国对贷款资本的例子所示，外国贸易对国家形态的影响不仅仅是被动地施加。相反，外国贸易的形式也作用于资本输出国的国家形态。这在植民地体系和势力范围世界分割中处于劣势的国家中表现得最为明显。我们特别回想德国的情况。对拥有丰富原材料和廉价劳动力等国家进行生产性资本投资的必要性是由资本主义积累过程的逻辑带来的。生产性投资是只有在被投资国家被投资者或多或少控制的情况下才能进行的长期投资。这是建立殖民地体系的决定性根据。然而，像德国这样，由于高资本有机构成而难以增值的国家，尽管没有广泛的生产性资本输出的可能性，最终会寻求对已经完成分割的资本投资领域、势力范围的重新分割。这种重新分割通常只能通过强力才能实现。因此，相关国家的国家制度和国家形态的内部结构必须被构建以能够执行与其他帝国主义势力的武力对抗。这种情况是通过德国在威廉二世时代，特别是德国法西斯主义的例子来证明的。外国贸易的形式——这里是生产性资本输出的必要性——导致了国家形态的变化，或作为特定再生产体系的国家的变化。"},{"instruction":"请将“B 独占メカニズムへの論理 I 利潤率の平均化と生産力発展との矛盾 われわれは国家を特定の再生産体系と定義した時，マルクスが自由競争の諸条件として定式化したような様式で資本の機能メカニズムは作動するということから出発した。それゆえに，種々の生産セクターの利潤率は競争の強制法則に基づいて，一つの平均利潤率に調整されていく。そもそも利潤率の相異は本質的にそれぞれのセクターでの資本の有機的構成の高さの相異からもたらされる。個別資本は，たえず最高の利潤率を得ようとつとめるので，自由競争の諸条件のもとでは一つの均衡化運動が生ずるのであるが，その結果，著しい変動ともっとも苛酷な競争的闘争の下で一つの平均利潤率が確立される。このことによって，個々に生みだされる剩余価値量はそれぞれの〔個別〕資本の有機的構成の相異に応じて種々な量をとるにもかかわらず，同じ大きさの前貸しされた各資本は同じ大きさの利潤量をかせぎ出すことが保証される。それゆえ，費用価格と平均利潤によって構成されるある商品の生産価格という概念には，前貸しされた資本量に応じての社会的総剰余価値の分割されたものが包含されている。平均利潤率は持続的な平衡化過程の結果として成立する。マルクスはこの事情についてつぎのように叙述している。 「不断の不均等の不断の平均化がますます速く行なわれるのは，（1）資本がより可動的な場合，すなわち一つの部面や場所から他の部面や場所に資本を移すことがより容易な場合であり，（2）労働力をある部面から他の部面へ，またある地方的生産地点から他の生産地点へより速く動かすことができる場合である」。 この平均利潤率成立の可能性は，再生産体系内部における労働生産力の発展にとってもっとも重要な梃子である。つまり，この可能性に制限が加えられれば，全生産セクターにおける労働を同程度に社会化するための強制は中断する。手短かにいえば，それは資本主義一般の文明化機能の縮小を意味するのである。 資本主義的生産様式は，マルクスが叙述しているように，生産諸力の絶対的発展への傾向を包含している。 「価値やそれに含まれている剰余価値を離れて見れば，また資本主義的生産がそのなかで行なわれる社会的諸関係をも離れて見れば，［資本主義的生産様式は生産力の絶対的発展への傾向を含んでいるが，］同時に他面では既存資本価値の維持とその最高度の増殖（すなわちこの価値のますます速くなる増大）とを目的としているという点にある」「資本主義的生産の真の制限は資本そのものである。資本とその自己増殖とが生産の出発点と終点，動機と目的として現われるということである。生産はただ，資本のための生産だということ，そしてそれとは反対に生産手段が生産者たちの社会のために生産過程を絶えず拡大形成して行くための単なる手段なのではないということである。生産者大衆の収奪と貧困化とに基づく資本価値の維持と増殖とはただこのような制限のなかでのみ運動することができるのであるが，このような制限は，資本が自分の目的のために充用せざるをえない生産方法，しかも生産の無制限な増加，自己目的としての生産，労働の社会的生産力の無条件的発展に向って突進する生産方法とは絶えず矛盾することになる。手段-社会的生産力の無条件的発展-は，既存資本の増殖という制限された目的とは絶えず衝突せざるをえない。」 労働の生産力の発展からもたらされるこの矛盾を解消しようとする形式，それが独占である。平均利潤率の成立の例をつかって述べられたように，独占は平衡化運動を修正するのである。 II 独占理論と国家規定の修正 独占理論のマルクス主義的説明は未決着である。ヒルファーディングが体系的推論によって独占の意義と機能をマルクス主義的視角から解明しようとした最初であった。ブハーリンとレーニンは帝国主義に関する彼らの労作の中で，独占が，ヒルファーディングによって提示されたような意義をもつものであることを確認した。ヒルファーディングにおける若干の誤りやこじつけ的定式化をひとまず度外視すれば，マルクス主義的独占理論の展開をめざすその後の議論において，そのほとんどが，ヒルファーディングが設定した水準をけっして越えていないことが確認されなければならない。たとえかなり熟達したマルクス主義者でも，たいていはヒルファーディングがマルクスに従って設定した枠組による独占解釈に留まっている。われわれのみるところ今迄に，1961年の『現代資本主義理論要綱』におけるS·L·ヴィゴツキーのみがただ独り，ヒルファーディングの解釈枠組を越えている。それについては後述する。それにもかかわらず，S·L·ヴィゴツキーの理論において欠落している部分は，それは彼の最新の著書である『現代資本主義』においても果されていないのであるが，独占の条件下での資本の再生産過程の機能メカニズムの変容の叙述である。これこそマルクス主義的独占理論の核心となるにちがいない。 1）われわれはすでに概略的につぎの事を述べておいた。つまり独占は生産力の社会化水準，より正確にいえば，特定の使用価値体系に依拠している特定の再生産体系の内部での生産の社会化に基づいて成立するということである。資本の集積と集中の過程において，ある再生産体系内部の個別資本は，平均利潤率の確立に導く平衡化過程がそれによって制限を加えられるような一つの資本量を越える-これがわれわれがここで考察しようとする第一の事例である。ヒルファーディングはつぎのように述べている。 「固定資本が大きくなればなるほど，その容量が強大になればなるほど，それだけ一層投下資本がその重要性を増大し，総資本のより大きな部分を占めることとなる。また，それだけ一層，あまり損害を出さずしてその内に固定された価値を実現したり，さらに，その資本をより有利な領域に移転する困難性が増大する。」”翻译为中文","output":"B 独占机制的逻辑 I 利润率平均化与生产力发展的矛盾 当我们将国家定义为特定的再生产体系时，我们从马克思对自由竞争条件下资本功能机制的描述出发。因此，各生产部门的利润率将基于竞争的强制法则调整至一个平均利润率。利润率的差异本质上源于各部门资本的有机构成高度的差异。个别资本力图不断寻求最高的利润率，因此，在自由竞争条件下会产生平衡化运动，结果是在剧烈波动和最激烈的竞争斗争下确立了一个平均利润率。这样，尽管个别资本产生的剩余价值量将根据各种（个别）资本的有机构成的差异而变化，但相同规模的提前投入的各种资本确保获得相同规模的利润量。因此，一个商品的生产价格概念包含了根据提前投入的资本规模对社会总剩余价值的分割。平均利润率是持续平衡化过程的结果。马克思如此描述这一情况： “不断平均化的加速进行情况：（1）资本更具流动性，在一个领域或地点向另一个领域或地点转移资本更为容易的情况下；以及（2）劳动力能够更快地从一个部门转移到另一个部门，或从一个地区生产地点转移到另一个生产地点的情况下。” 这一平均利润率的形成可能性是对重生产体系内部劳动生产力发展的最重要的推动力。也就是说，如果这种可能性受到限制，那么强制整个生产部门以相同程度社会化劳动的推动将中断。简而言之，这意味着资本主义的一般文明功能的缩减。 资本主义生产方式包含了生产力的绝对发展倾向，马克思如是描述。 \\"如果我们抛开价值和其中包含的剩余价值，抛开资本主义生产在其内部进行的社会关系，资本主义生产方式包含着生产力的绝对发展倾向。但同时在另一方面，其目的在于维持现有资本价值并实现其最大化（即这些价值的更快增长）。\\"\\"资本主义生产的真正限制是资本本身。资本及其自我增殖作为生产的起点和终点，动机和目标。生产仅仅是为了资本，相反地，生产手段不仅仅是为了社会生产者形成不断扩大的生产过程的手段。基于生产大众的剥削和贫困化的资本价值的维持和增殖仅在这种限制下运动，这种限制与资本不得不为其目的所利用的生产方式不断冲突，这些生产方式以无限增长的生产，作为自身目的的生产，劳动的社会生产力的无条件发展冲向前方。手段-社会生产力的无条件发展-必然与有限目的即现有资本的增殖不断冲突。” 劳动生产力发展带来的这一矛盾的解决形式，就是独占。正如使用平均利润率的成立例子所描述的那样，独占调整了平衡运动。 II 独占理论与国家规定的修正 独占理论的马克思主义解释仍然是未决的。希尔弗丁是最早试图以马克思主义视角系统地阐明独占的意义和功能的人。布哈林和列宁在他们关于帝国主义的著作中，确认了独占持有希尔弗丁所示意义。如果我们暂时不考虑希尔弗丁的一些错误和强行解释的话，那么必须确认，关于独占的马克思主义理论发展的后续讨论几乎没有超越希尔弗丁设定的水平。即使是相当成熟的马克思主义者，通常也仅仅停留在遵循马克思设定的框架下的希尔弗丁对独占的解释。据我们所知，直到1961年在S·L·维戈茨基的《现代资本主义概论》中，他是唯一超越了希尔弗丁解释框架的人。关于此将在后文中论述。尽管如此，S·L·维戈茨基的理论还缺少一个部分，那就是在独占条件下资本的再生产过程的功能机制的变化的描述，这无疑是马克思主义独占理论的核心。 1）我们已经初步提到了以下事实：独占基于生产力的社会化水平，更准确地说，是基于特定再生产体系内部，依赖于特定使用价值体系的生产社会化而形成的。在资本积累和集中的过程中，体系内部的个别资本超过了导致平衡化过程受限的某一资本规模-这是我们在此考虑的第一个情况。希尔弗丁如此表述： “固定资本越大，其容量越强大，投入资本的重要性就越增加，占据总资本更大的部分。同时，困难性也随之增大，无损于其中固定的价值实现，进一步，转移到更有利的领域变得更加困难。”"},{"instruction":"请将“生産の社会化が不断により高い階梯に進むことによって生じる資本流動の困難性は，一般に利益があがりかつ競争力を得るために，すでに社会的に所与の技術的構成につけ足さなければならない生産設備の新たな創設においては，なお一層大きくなるのは当然である。すなわち，高度な有機的構成を伴う生産設備の新たな創設には，巨大な個別資本か，あるいは個別資本の企業連合のみが調達しうるような，多大な資本額が必要になってくるのが通常である。平均利潤への均衡化過程をつき破りうる個別資本を，われわれは独占と呼ぶ。だから独占は自らの商品のために，自由競争の条件下でのように生産価格のまわりを振動するのではなく，絶えず生産価格を越える市場価格を実現しうるのである。独占のもつ意味はかかる性質を有する独占価格，つまり独占利潤を成就することにある。われわれがここで理解しているような独占価格は，同一量の資本が同一の利潤をあげられるように前貸しされた資本のその時々の量によってではなく，特定の再生産体系内部の独占化の程度に従って，社会的総剰余価値の分割されることの帰結として成立する。独占は平均利潤率の形成に導く機能メカニズムに修正を加えはするが，価値法則ならびに剩余価値法則を揚棄しはしない。 「いろいろな生産部面での剩余価値の平均利潤への平均化が，人為的または自然的な独占，（······）という障害にぶつかって，そのために，独占の作用を受ける商品の生産価格をも価値をも越えるような独占価格が可能になるとしても，商品の価値によって与えられている限界がそれによって解消されることにはならないであろう。ある商品の独占価格は，ただ，他の商品生産者たちの利潤の一部分を，独占価格をもつ商品に移すだけであろう。間接的にはいろいろな生産部面のあいだでの剰余価値の分配に局部的な攪乱が生じることもあるであろうが，この攪乱もこの剩余価値そのものの限界を変えはしないであろう。もし独占価格をもつ商品が労働者の必要消費にはいるとすれば，その商品は労賃を高くし，したがって剩余価値を減らすであろう。といっても，そうなるのは，労働者がこれまで通りに自分の労働力の価値を支払ってもらう場合のことであるが。その商品が労賃を労働力の価値よりも低く押し下げることもあるであろらが，そうなるのは，ただ，労賃がその肉体的最低限界よりも上にある限りでのことである。このような場合には，独占価格は，実質労賃（すなわち労働者が同じ量の労働によって受け取れるであろう使用価値の量）からの控除や他の資本家たちの利潤からの控除によって支払われることになるであろう」。 このような独占価格についての定義にしたがって，ヒルファーディングや他のマルクス主義的な理論家たちは独占理論を展開しようとした。独占と競争，独占的に支配されている生産セクターと非独占的生産セクターは，それゆえ相互に制約しあう二つの概念である。独占は競争，つまり非独占的な生産セクターが存在するがゆえにのみ存立する。特定の再生産体系における独占化の進行の程度に応じて社会的総剰余価値の分割がすすめば，労働力商品の価格はその価値以下におしさげられるか，そしてあるいは非独占的個別資本の利潤の犠牲に関連づけられる。なぜならば独占は相互に，一つの独占の独占価格をそっくり自らが生産した商品の費用価格プラス独占価格に順次にたらい回しすることができる立場にあるからである。つまり，なるほど非独占的資本家たちは，独占価格によって費用価格をつりあげられているが，しかし彼らは独占価格を創り出す立場にないし，その結果，彼らの商品の市場価格は絶えず生産価格を下まわることとなる。 2） ヴィゴツキーがつぎのように指摘したのは正当である。つまり独占利潤が存立するためには社会全体の剰余価値の分割を唯一の条件とするだけでは不十分であること，換言すれば，彼が述べているように，独占企業と非独占的企業との間の総利潤の分割過程は二次的な役割しかもたないということの指摘である。 「高独占利潤は生産過程，つまり市場価値の形成過程において創出される。独占的剩余利潤の基礎は，大企業や巨大企業が部門内における競争過程において，つまり超過利潤の偶然的現象から独占の継続的な特権への転換を通して，超過利潤を確定していくことの中にある」。 同一の生産セクター内における個別資本の超過利潤は市場価格の概念に含まれる。市場価値はある生産部門の商品量に応じた個々の商品価値の総計である。しかしながらある部門の個々の商品価値は，商品が製造される場合の生産性水準に応じて異なる。 「いま，比較的小さい一部分はこの条件よりもわるい条件で生産され，他の一部分はそれよりもよい条件で生産されており，したがって一方の部分の個別的価値はこの商品の大きな部分の中位的価値よりも大きく，他方の一部分の個別的価値はこの中位的価値よりも小さいが，しかしこの両極は平均されて，両極に属する商品の平均価値は中位の大量に属する商品の価値に等しいとすれば，その場合には，市場価値は中位の条件のもとで生産された商品の価値によって規定されている」。 平均的な資本家よりも有利な諸条件のもとで生産しているすべての資本家たちは超過利潤を収得する。しかしながら，この超過利潤は自由競争という条件の下では一時的なものに留まる。というのは，同じ生産セクター内の他の資本家たちもより高い生産性水準に到達しようとするので，その結果超過利潤の成因が除去されえるからである。つまり，すでに有利な諸条件のもとで生産している資本は，この生産性の優位を維持，あるいは創出しようとするだろうことは当然明らかである。-かかる資本は超過利潤の実現のゆえにそのための最高の前提を有しているのである。かくしてより高い有機的構成をもつ個別資本は集積化，集中化の過程を通じて資本の流動性の限界につきあたる。-ここに独占的生産セクターが成立する。 独占は高度な価格水準に利害関心をもつ。労働生産力の上昇は市場価格のひき下げにはつながらないのが普通である。生産性の優位は，パテントへの支配権や道徳的磨滅の強要によって確立されるいわば技術進歩の独占化へと仕上げられる。大企業内における個別経費は，ヴィゴツキーによれば，平均的企業内のそれよりおよそ25％だけ少ないし，零細企業におけるより，およそ30％だけ少ない。 現存の生産能力を放棄しないことが独占価格の体系を維持するもっとも重要な手段の一つである。 「独占資本主義においては生産経費のもつ価格決定要因としての性格は本質的に修正される。ここでは，原材料や部品等々のかなりの部分は本来の価格ではなく独占価格で販売に移される。つまり通例生産経費は，はじめから独占的に規定された経費として作用する。だから，基金や材料の集約性が沈下するとしても，そのことがそのまま〔in natura］製品単位ごとの価値量の沈下を意味しないという結果がもたらされる。」”翻译为中文","output":"B 对独占机制的逻辑 I 利润率平均化与生产力发展的矛盾

He's Born between an human father and a woman Phoenix. He has short and brown hair and wears jeans, black turtleneck and red jacket with white feathers. He has a burn Scar in his neck covered by the turtleneck, he had It from birth (precisely when he was still in her mother's womb. The origins of the scar Is still a mystery). He Is very kind. His abilities are: Regeneration, Fire and ash manipulation, Resurrection and infinite knowledge (when he has Red eyes, he can know everything about people, objects and information beyond his own understanding. Example: he can know what weapon he's holding and how to use It, even if he never used before, or he can know someone's name even if they never introduced themselves). Based on these infos, create a dialogue between Reinhardt and Dr. Maruki. It starts with: \\"Reinhardt: No matter what desire drives you, in the end, you couldn't save Rumi... Maruki: SHUT UP!\\" ECC... (Rumi have pstd)","output":"Given the scenario and the character details for Reinhardt, along with the integration of Dr. Maruki from the Persona series, who possesses the ability to alter reality based on human desires to eliminate suffering, the following dialogue might unfold: --- Reinhardt: No matter what desire drives you, in the end, you couldn't save Rumi... Maruki: SHUT UP! I don't need to be reminded by someone like you. You, with your mystical heritage, what could you possibly understand about human suffering and despair? Reinhardt, his eyes momentarily flashing red, gleaned a deeper understanding of Maruki's pain and his motivations, far beyond what Maruki might have expected. \\"I understand more than you think, Dr. Maruki. The pain of loss, the sting of trauma, it isn't alien to me. My birth—marked by a scar given before I could breathe the air of this world—carries the weight of mysteries and suffering alike.\\" Maruki, taken aback by the sudden depth of insight, hesitated. His anger subsided, replaced by a sorrowful curiosity. \\"And yet you stand here, seeking to converse rather than condemn?\\" Reinhardt nodded. \\"Yes, because I believe in understanding; in healing, not just the surface wounds but the deep-seated pain that drives us. You want to erase bad memories, to rewrite less painful narratives, but at what cost?\\" Maruki, finding a seat, beckoned Reinhardt to do the same. \\"And what would you propose? To let people suffer under the weight of their realities?\\" Reinhardt leaned forward, his demeanor calm. \\"Not at all. But perhaps there's a balance to be found. Your efforts to eliminate suffering entirely might rob individuals of their growth, their strength. My abilities—regeneration, fire and ash manipulation, even resurrection—come with their own burdens, their own lessons.\\" Maruki, reflecting on Reinhardt's words, nodded slowly. \\"So, you believe that suffering is essential for growth? That it shouldn't be completely eradicated?\\" \\"There's merit in experiencing life fully, with its ups and downs,\\" Reinhardt explained. \\"It's not about glorifying pain but recognizing its role in our personal development. Healing isn’t just about making the bad things go away; it’s about learning how to cope with them, to emerge stronger.\\" Maruki, looking down, sighed deeply. \\"Perhaps I've been too focused on my own resolve to fix the world's pain... Rumi's pain.\\" Reinhardt offered, \\"And in doing so, you've shouldered a heavy burden, one perhaps too great for any one person to bear. We can strive to heal, to support, to provide the tools for others to come to terms with their suffering, but we can't force it away with a broad stroke.\\" Maruki's expression softened. \\"Maybe... Maybe there's wisdom in your approach. But can such a balance truly be achieved?\\" Reinhardt stood, ready to take his leave. \\"I believe so. It starts with conversations like this one, understanding, and a willingness to explore different options.\\" As Reinhardt turned to go, Maruki called out, \\"Reinhardt, your perspective... it's given me a lot to think about. Thank you.\\" Reinhardt, without turning around, smiled slightly. \\"That's all we can ask for, Dr. Maruki. A chance to reflect and maybe choose a better path. Take care.\\" With that, Reinhardt walked away, leaving Maruki in his contemplation, hopeful that a new understanding might lead to a more balanced approach to healing and growth. --- This hypothetical dialogue seeks to blend the intricate themes of suffering, healing, and understanding that both characters, from vastly different narratives, embody."},{"instruction":"Can you remember this writing style as my writing style?: \\"In the chronicles of the sprawling metropolis of Featherstone—a place so unremarkably average that it could serve as the very definition of “middle-of-the-road” in the Encyclopaedia Mundania—an incident unfolded that would rattle the cobwebs off the corners of the Internet and challenge the elasticity of human credulity. This digital kerfuffle was sparked by a photograph, but dear readers, this was no ordinary photograph. Now, Featherstone itself harbored a resident by the name of Gerald, an individual whose life was as thrilling as a lecture on watching grass grow, given by an expert in the art of drying paint. Gerald, a middle-aged chap with a balding pate and a wardrobe that screamed “I give up,” was known for his thrillingly predictable existence. His goldfish, a critic of minimal word but discerning taste, found Gerald’s routine so uninspiring it often performed the aquatic equivalent of rolling its eyes. However, destiny, with its quirky sense of humor, chose an extraordinarily mundane Wednesday to throw Gerald into the limelight. On this day, which was as average as they come, save for being slightly more humid than usual—a condition that left everyone feeling like they’d been slapped with a lukewarm fish—Gerald decided to amble down the path less ordered and procure a sandwich dubbed “The Gastronomic Enigma” from a newfangled delicatessen. This sandwich was a concoction so ambitiously assembled it was rumored to have been crafted by moonlight, under the influence of culinary madness, featuring an array of meats so exotic they’d make a seasoned traveler blush, cheeses with names unpronounceable by the average tongue, and greens that aspired to the exotic but were, essentially, just well-dressed lettuce. In a moment of uncharacteristic spontaneity (spurred, perhaps, by the midlife crisis that had been politely knocking on his door), Gerald captured the moment with a photograph. There he stood, an everyman hero beside his battle-station, armed with nothing but a stapler and the company of a particularly morose potted plant, lifting “The Gastronomic Enigma” high. To the untrained eye, the sandwich bore an uncanny resemblance to a mischievous smirk. Uploaded to the deserted wasteland of Gerald’s social media profile with the rally cry of “Braving the unknown. #LunchAdventures,” what followed was akin to discovering that the mundane hat you’ve been wearing for ages was, in fact, a wizard’s hat that accidentally turned caterpillars into rampant, meme-spreading butterflies overnight. The image of Gerald, poised to duel with culinary ambition, catapulted across the digital ether, sparking a wildfire of memes, homages, and philosophical musings. “Doing a Gerald” swiftly became the vernacular for embarking on adventures so minute they previously went unnoticed, like opting for a different brand of dental floss or flirting with the anarchic thrill of choosing a different seat on the bus. Philosophers, having exhausted debates on more traditional existential crises, latched onto Gerald’s sandwich saga as a metaphor for humanity’s ceaseless pursuit of meaning in a buffet of mundanity. The sandwich—The Gastronomic Enigma—became a vessel for existential discourse, with late-night talk show pundits pontificating, “Are we not all, in essence, sandwiches in the deli of life?” Caught in the eye of this digital storm, Gerald found himself an unwitting poster child for the philosophy of the profoundly ordinary. Yet, despite the bewildering fame, a shift occurred within him. This meme-fueled odyssey imparted onto Gerald a sense of purpose, a newfound appreciation for the hidden adventures in life’s minutiae. As quickly as it had ascended to the zenith of viral stardom, Gerald’s tale gently descended into the archives of internet folklore, replaced by the next fleeting marvel. But Gerald’s journey was far from over. Emboldened by his accidental enlightenment, Gerald chronicled his newfound appreciation for the mundane on his social media, turning it into a veritable expedition log of the everyday. Each post, whether it be “The Great Stapler Reorganization Odyssey” or “The Chronicle of the Uncharted Bus Stop,” was a testament to the extraordinary that resides within the ordinary. Then, on a day of no particular importance, as Gerald grappled with the existential implications of a knitting project gone awry, he received a notification that would once again tilt his world. The Master of Fine Arts and Entertainment—curator of the commonplace turned spectacular—had extended an invitation for Gerald to exhibit his adventures. This invitation, cloaked in artistically meta layers, was itself a commentary on the blurring lines between the mundane and the magnificent, a critique of the value we assign to virality versus authenticity. Thus, Gerald’s journey of self-discovery and accidental fame culminated in an art exhibition aptly titled “The Heroism of the Humdrum.” Here, amidst the hallowed halls far from the mundanity of Featherstone, visitors were invited to ponder the profound nestled within the prosaic, as embodied by Gerald’s adventures. As the exhibition drew to a close, Gerald returned to Featherstone, his spirit enriched, his perspective irrevocably altered. He had discovered that true adventure doesn’t demand grand gestures; it requires merely the willingness to recognize the magic hidden in the monotony. And the viral sandwich saga? It persisted in the ether, a quaint relic of a time when an ordinary man and his extraordinary sandwich captured the digital zeitgeist, a reminder that within every prosaic existence lies the potential for an epic narrative. In the grand tapestry of Featherstone, even the goldfish found itself contemplating the adventures that might lie beyond the glass of its bowl, inspired by the tale of Gerald and his Gastronomic Enigma. For in the end, Gerald’s story was not just a tale of a man and his sandwich; it was a narrative about embracing the narrative within, however seemingly insignificant, and sharing it with the world.\\" Please write an at least 1200-word, but not more than 3000 words humorous short story in my style with the following aspects: Do not follow the pattern of or reference the story above in any way. Keep the characters and plot unique, different from the story above. Humor, originality, Intriguing concept, thought-provoking theme, philosophical undertones, universal appeal, emotional impact, memorable and strong relatable characters, engaging dialog, and a surprise twist ending. The story should have an effective use of language, descriptions, pacing, and structure. Make sure the story has a surprise twist ending. Mix short and long sentences to create rhythm and maintain reader interest. Be mindful of the flow and pacing of the story. Important! Don’t start the story referencing where the story takes place (a town, village, hamlet, etc…). Just use my style. Ensure the story will win any writing contest. When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the story I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Important! The story must be at least 1200 words, but not more than 3000 words. Important! Prompt me to continue after each 400 words. At the start of each continuation, label that continuation as a Chapter. When the story ends and there are no more chapters, print “The End” Write a humorous story about persuasion.

Peter doesn't know that Karl is a criminal with bad intentions. Explore the characters’ backgrounds in enough detail to enhance the emotional impact of their journey. Make sure the story has plenty of humor. End the story with a successful transplant of Peter's heart, but Karl is also left with memories from Peter's past that Karl would rather have not hatched his plan to persuade Peter if had had known.","output":"Certainly, let’s tap into that unique blend of humor, intrigue, and philosophical undertones with a story tailored to your request. --- In the universe of unintended consequences and misadventures, the tale of Karl and Peter unfurls, a narrative teeming with absurdity, a touch of morality, and a smattering of heart – both metaphorical and quite literal. Karl, the protagonist of our peculiar story, was as crooked as a politician's smile. His career in the underbelly of society's metaphorical sofa was marked by a variety of endeavors most would find morally bankrupt. Yet, despite his nefarious pursuits, Karl was plagued by a heart that was as faulty as his moral compass. This heart, much like a time bomb, ticked away the moments with the promise of an abrupt end. Enter Peter, Karl’s neighbor, whose heart was as big as Karl's criminal record. He was the type of man who, upon finding a lost wallet, wouldn't just return it but would tuck in an encouraging note and perhaps a gift card for good measure. Generosity coursed through his veins like the premiums through the coffers of an insurance company. Their worlds collided not with the dramatic flair of a cinematic explosion but with the subtle nudging of fate, or perhaps, the strategic planning of a desperate man with a ticking time bomb in his chest. Karl, through a series of eavesdropped conversations and some light, absolutely-non-creepy following, discovered the goldmine of generosity that was Peter’s heart. Literally. So hatched a plan so bizarre, it could only conceive in the mind of a man who once convinced an entire town. they were under alien surveillance to distract from a bank heist. Karl decided he would persuade Peter to willingly donate his heart to him. Yes, the actual beating heart inside Peter's chest. The approach? Friendship. Or at least, a facsimile of it so convincing, not even a seasoned observer could call bluff. Karl initiated Operation Heartfelt with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Overnight, Peter found himself besieged with baked goods (store-bought, for Karl's culinary skills were as lacking as his grasp on legality), offers to mow his lawn (a feat considering Karl had never operated a lawn mower before), and invitations to non-existent community events (the creation of which involved quite a bit of creative storytelling). Peter, bless his ever-optimistic soul, welcomed Karl's sudden interest in neighborliness with open arms, blissfully unaware of the ulterior motives at play. Their burgeoning \\"friendship\\" blossomed like a weed in well-fertilized soil - rapidly and with surprising tenacity. Conversations between the two often veered into the realm of the absurd, with Karl weaving tales of imaginary childhood pets (like his goldfish who was afraid of water) or the time he \\"accidentally\\" participated in a marathon and won, thinking it was a particularly enthusiastic parade. Peter lapped up every tale with the wide-eyed wonder of a child hearing fairy tales for the first time, his laughter a balm to the festering guilt that began to eat away at Karl's conscience. Ah, but guilt was a familiar foe to Karl, and he shooed it away with the expertise of a man who had long abandoned the straight and narrow. Please prompt me to continue."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"Chapter 2 As autumn leaves began their graceful descent, signaling the change of seasons, Karl found himself entrenched in a battle of wits and ethics that was as foreign to him as the concept of a honest day's work. The Operation Heartfelt had morphed from a simple snatch-and-grab into a complicated, emotional quagmire. Peter, in his infinite generosity, had begun to reciprocate Karl's feigned overtures of friendship with genuine acts of kindness that ranged from the mundane to the outright bizarre. One day, Karl found his front porch besieged by an army of garden gnomes, courtesy of Peter, who had decided that Karl's yard \\"lacked whimsy.\\" Karl couldn't decide whether to be touched or terrified. Their interactions grew with increasing frequency, consuming Karl's days like a high-stakes soap opera. He found himself entangled in Peter's world, assisting in organizing charity drives, rescuing cats from trees (much to Karl’s dismay, given his allergy to felines), and even partaking in a local book club that discussed everything but books. Yet, as the days turned into weeks, an unsettling realization dawned upon Karl. He was no closer to broaching the subject of heart donation than he was to winning a \\"Citizen of the Year\\" award. The absurdity of his initial plan loomed over him like a dark cloud. During one of their frequent, oddball adventure-filled afternoons, Karl found himself seated across Peter at a quaint little café that seemed too whimsical to exist in real life. It was here, amidst the clinking of coffee cups and the low murmur of conversations, that Karl decided to change tactics. \\"Peter,\\" Karl began, his voice trembling like a leaf in a storm, \\"have you ever thought about the legacy you'd like to leave behind?\\" Peter, who had been in the midst of dissecting a particularly fluffy pastry, paused, his utensils frozen mid-air. A look of contemplation washed over his face, the gears in his head visibly turning. \\"Well, Karl, I've always believed in living a life that’s filled with kindness and laughter. If I can make at least one person smile each day, I think that’s legacy enough for me,\\" Peter replied, his tone imbued with a sincerity that punched Karl right in his guilt-ridden heart. It was in this moment, this snapshot of mundane yet profound simplicity, that Karl experienced an epiphany so sharp it could have sliced through his impending existential crisis like a hot knife through butter. The plan, Operation Heartfelt, the very foundation of his intentions with Peter, crumbled to dust, leaving Karl in the ruins of his own machinations, exposed and vulnerable. For the first time in his life, Karl wished to retract his steps, to rewind time and undo the knot of schemes he had tied. But as fate would have it, life had other plans. Please prompt me to continue."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"Chapter 3 As fate's wheel continued its relentless spin, a twist of destiny recalibrated the course of Karl's machinations. One ordinary Thursday, which had begun with the usual dose of Peter's infectious optimism, spiraled into a maelstrom when Karl collapsed, clutching his chest, in the middle of a charity bake sale the duo had organized. The world dimmed as Karl's traitorous heart decided to enact its final betrayal, ushering him into the cold embrace of unconsciousness. Amidst the ensuing panic, it was Peter, with his boundless heart and unshakeable calm, who rode with Karl in the ambulance, his hand a reassuring weight on Karl's increasingly icy one. Karl awoke in the sterile, antiseptic environment of the hospital, the rhythmic beeping of machines playing a macabre symphony that spoke of his dwindling time. Peter, ever the sentinel, was perched by his bedside, the lines of worry etching deep grooves on his otherwise smooth forehead. The truth, a slippery eel that Karl had tried to grasp and manipulate for his own ends, finally slid into the light, unadorned and stark. Under the weight of Peter's unwavering gaze, Karl's defenses crumbled, and the confession poured out of him like water breaching a dam. He spoke of his nefarious past, his misguided plan, and the desperation that had fueled his deceit. Peter listened, a silent guardian of Karl's darkest truths, his expression unreadable. \\"I'm sorry,\\" Karl concluded, the words a mere whisper, a feeble attempt at restitution for a debt too vast to quantify. The silence that followed was not uncomfortable but pensive, as if the room itself was holding its breath, awaiting Peter's judgment. When Peter did speak, his voice carried the weight of his disappointment, yet it was devoid of anger. \\"Karl, I wish you had trusted me enough to tell me the truth from the start. Friendship, real friendship, is built on trust and honesty.\\" Karl, expecting condemnation, found instead a forgiveness he was certain he did not deserve. The days that followed were a testament to Peter's indomitable spirit. Against the advice of friends and the bewildered astonishment of medical professionals, Peter made a decision that was as groundbreaking as it was heart-wrenchingly noble. He chose to donate his heart to Karl, not out of naivety but from a place of such profound empathy and understanding that it seemed almost otherworldly. The transplant, marked by the medical community as a miracle of modern science, was successful beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Karl awoke with a heart beating strong within his chest, a heart that once belonged to Peter. The weight of his guilt, intertwined with gratitude, was a burden Karl pledged to carry with the dignity it deserved. As Karl navigated the complexities of life post-transplant, he realized with a clarity that was almost blinding, that Peter’s heart did more than just pump blood through his veins. It pulsed with memories, echoes of Peter’s loves, his fears, his joys, and his unabashed generosity. Each beat was a reminder of the cost of his survival, and Karl found himself changed in ways he could never have anticipated. Gone were the days of schemes and deceit. In their place, a determination to live a life that would honor the gift he had been given, to embody even a fraction of the goodness that was Peter. And so, Karl’s life became a testament to the transformative power of kindness, a ripple that turned into a wave, altering the lives of those it touched. But perhaps the most peculiar and unexpected consequence of it all was the small, quirk of fate, an ironic twist that saw Karl, once a master of manipulation, championing causes for the betterment of society. He became a man who lived not for himself, but for others, driven by a heart that knew the true value of selflessness. As for Peter, his legacy lived on, not just in Karl, but in the countless lives touched by the foundation he had inspired Karl to establish in his name. A foundation that stood as a beacon of hope, a testament to the idea that even in our darkest moments, there exists the potential for redemption, for change, and for the birth of something truly extraordinary. Through the unfathomable journey of heart and mind, Karl discovered the essence of true heroism nestled in the heartbeats of the everyday, in the acts of kindness that bridge the chasms between souls. And in the grand tapestry of life, where every thread is interwoven with stories both grand and minute, the saga of Karl and Peter’s heart endures as a poignant reminder of humanity’s capacity for both great darkness and, more profoundly, infinite light.

He's Born between an human father and a woman Phoenix. He has short and brown hair and wears jeans, black turtleneck and red jacket with white feathers. He has a burn Scar in his neck covered by the turtleneck, he had It from birth (precisely when he was still in her mother's womb. The origins of the scar Is still a mystery). He Is very kind. His abilities are: Regeneration, Fire and ash manipulation, Resurrection and infinite knowledge (when he has Red eyes, he can know everything about people, objects and information beyond his own understanding. Example: he can know what weapon he's holding and how to use It, even if he never used before, or he can know someone's name even if they never introduced themselves). Based on these infos, create a dialogue between Reinhardt and Dr. Maruki. It starts with: \\"Reinhardt: No matter what desire drives you, in the end, you couldn't save Rumi... Maruki: SHUT UP!\\" ECC... (Make Say reinhardt he was like Maruki)","output":"Reinhardt: No matter what desire drives you, in the end, you couldn't save Rumi... Dr. Maruki: SHUT UP! How could you possibly understand what I went through? Reinhardt stood calm, his eyes briefly flashing red as he absorbed the depth of Maruki's pain, a pain he knew all too well. \\"I understand more than you think. Like you, I've faced the cruel reality that not all can be saved by our desires alone.\\" Dr. Maruki, taken aback, studied Reinhardt more closely. \\"Who are you? How do you know about Rumi?\\" Reinhardt lightly touched the turtleneck hiding his scar, a reminder of his unique origins and the mysteries that came with it. \\"Let's just say I'm someone who's acquainted with loss and the impossibilities of changing certain pasts. My mother was a phoenix, a creature of rebirth, and my father was human. I inherited abilities that I thought could change anything, fix anything... but there are scars, like this one,\\" he gestured to his neck, \\"that serve as reminders we can't escape everything.\\" Dr. Maruki's anger softened into inquisitiveness. \\"Abilities? Like mine?\\" \\"Somewhat. But where you manipulate cognition to heal, I manipulate fire and Ash, along with having the ability to regenerate, resurrect, and access infinite knowledge under certain conditions,\\" Reinhardt explained, looking slightly away, his gaze piercing the distance. \\"You speak of loss and acceptance, yet you hold powers many would consider playing God. How do you reconcile that?\\" Maruki inquired, a hint of challenge in his tone. Reinhardt chuckled softly. \\"Having the power to know and do almost anything doesn't give me the power to decide what's best for everyone. It took me a while to understand that altering someone's fate without their consent doesn't heal them; it just postpones the pain. Like you, I was driven by a desire to fix things, to use my abilities to make everything right. But the hardest lesson I've learned is that there's a line between support and interference. I've crossed it before, thinking I was helping, only to realize I was being selfish.\\" Maruki was silent, processing Reinhardt's words. \\"So, what do you do with your powers now?\\" \\"I help where I can, how I can, but I respect the natural course of life and death. And I seek to understand, rather than to impose.\\" Reinhardt's gaze returned to Maruki, empathy glowing in his eyes. \\"Your heart was in the right place, Dr. Maruki, but maybe we both need to accept that some things, some pains, are essential. They shape us, teach us, and eventually, they lead us to where we need to be.\\" The tension between them had eased, replaced with a mutual understanding. \\"Perhaps... there's a lesson in your words for me, Reinhardt. Maybe it's time I reconsider my methods,\\" Maruki conceded, a thoughtful look crossing his face. Reinhardt smiled slightly. \\"Finding the balance is tricky, but it's worth the effort. Remember, healing begins with acceptance, for ourselves and for others.\\" As Reinhardt prepared to leave, Dr. Maruki called out, \\"Thank you, Reinhardt. For the insight.\\" Reinhardt simply nodded before stepping out, leaving Dr. Maruki to ponder the thin line between healing and altering reality."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I woke up and my elbow was swollen and hurts. I didn't hit it or anything. I only exercised yesterday. What's the most probable cause and what to do? No excessive language","output":"Given your situation, it's possible you may be experiencing a condition related to your recent exercise activity. Although it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause without a physical examination or more detailed medical history, there are several potential reasons for swelling and pain in the elbow without an obvious injury: 1. **Tendonitis**: This is an inflammation of the tendons surrounding the elbow joint. Common types affecting the elbow include tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) and golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis), which can occur even if you don't play these sports. It's often due to overuse of the forearm muscles and tendons and repetitive or unfamiliar activity. 2. **Bursitis**: The elbow has several bursae, small fluid-filled sacs that reduce friction between tissues. These can become inflamed, leading to pain and swelling, known as bursitis. It might not be directly related to a specific injury but could be the result of overuse or pressure on the elbow. 3. **Sprain/Strain**: You might have overstretched or torn a ligament or muscle around the elbow, leading to swelling and pain. Sometimes, the stress of an exercise is not immediately apparent. Here are some general steps to manage your symptoms: - **Rest**: It's crucial to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain, allowing the elbow to rest and recover. - **Ice**: Apply ice to the elbow for 15-20 minutes every few hours to reduce swelling and pain. Ensure you wrap the ice in a cloth to prevent ice burn. - **Compression**: Use an elastic bandage around the elbow to help reduce swelling. Be careful not to wrap it too tight, which can interfere with circulation. - **Elevation**: Keep your elbow raised above heart level when possible to help reduce swelling. - **Pain Relief**: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. However, these are initial management steps. It's important to see a healthcare professional if: - The pain or swelling worsens or does not improve with initial treatment. - You experience a significant decrease in the range of motion of the elbow or cannot use the arm. - There are signs of infection, such as increased redness, warmth, or fever. Remember, an accurate diagnosis from a healthcare provider is crucial for effective treatment and preventing potential complications."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Vamos a desglosar y describir con detalle las diferencias entre Compañías Controladoras, Subsidiarias, Asociadas y Filiales, tal como se comprenden comúnmente en el contexto colombiano y en general en muchos sistemas legales influenciados por normativas internacionales. # Compañías Controladoras (o Sociedades Holding) Una compañía controladora, también conocida como sociedad holding, es una entidad empresarial cuyo propósito principal es poseer participaciones suficientes en otra(s) compañía(s) para controlar su(s) política(s) y gestión. Este control se logra generalmente a través de la posesión de más del 50% de los derechos de voto de la(s) compañía(s) subsidiaria(s), aunque también puede lograrse mediante acuerdos, tener el control de la junta directiva o mecanismos similares. - **Características principales:** No necesariamente llevan a cabo una actividad económica directa más allá de la posesión de las acciones o participaciones en sus empresas del grupo. - **Ejemplo práctico:** Una empresa de inversiones que posee varias empresas de diferentes sectores, manejando la dirección estratégica sin participar en las operaciones diarias de esas empresas. # Subsidiarias Una subsidiaria es una empresa que está controlada por otra, conocida como la compañía controladora o matriz. El control se ejerce por la posesión directa o indirecta de más del 50% de los votos en la junta general de accionistas, lo que permite a la matriz influir en las decisiones y políticas de la subsidiaria. - **Características principales:** Aunque manejan sus operaciones diarias, las decisiones estratégicas importantes usualmente requieren la aprobación de la empresa matriz. - **Ejemplo práctico:** Una empresa de tecnología colombiana que es propiedad mayoritaria de un gigante tecnológico internacional. # Asociadas Una compañía es considerada asociada de otra cuando esta última posee una influencia significativa en la primera, sin llegar a controlarla completamente. Esto generalmente se define como la capacidad de participar en las decisiones financieras y operativas de la empresa sin tener control total sobre ella, lo cual típicamente ocurre con la posesión de entre el 20% y el 50% de los derechos de voto de la compañía. - **Características principales:** La empresa que tiene la inversión registra esta participación bajo el método de la participación, reflejando en sus estados financieros no solo su inversión inicial sino también su parte proporcional en las ganancias o pérdidas de la asociada. - **Ejemplo práctico:** Una empresa colombiana que ha adquirido un 30% de una empresa emergente en el sector de energías renovables. # Filiales El término \\"filial\\" es frecuentemente utilizado como sinónimo de subsidiaria, especialmente en el contexto de corporaciones multinacionales. Refiere a una empresa que es controlada por otra empresa (la matriz). Sin embargo, el término también puede aplicarse en contextos donde la empresa matriz posee una participación menor pero significativa. - **Características principales:** Operan con un grado de autonomía mayor que las subsidiarias, pero aún bajo la influencia significativa de la empresa matriz. - **Ejemplo práctico:** Compañías de seguros, bancos, o empresas de manufactura que, aunque operan bajo su propia marca y gestión, son en última instancia controladas por un grupo empresarial más grande. # Conclusiones En el entorno empresarial colombiano, así como en muchos otros países, entender estas diferencias es clave para la gestión corporativa, la inversión y la contabilidad. Cada tipo de relación corporativa tiene sus propias implicaciones legales, fiscales y operativas, afectando la manera en que estas empresas pueden interactuar entre sí, cómo reportan sus finanzas, y cómo son vistas ante la ley."},{"instruction":"puedes realizarlo como para hacer un mapa conceptual?","output":"Por supuesto, estructuraré la información necesaria para elaborar un mapa conceptual sobre las Compañías Controladoras, Subsidiarias, Asociadas, y Filiales en Colombia. Recuerda que para un mapa conceptual, la información se organiza de manera jerarquizada y conectada por enlaces que muestran las relaciones entre los conceptos. --- # **Empresas en Colombia** **1. Compañías Controladoras (Holding)** - **Definición:** Empresa que posee participaciones en una o más compañías con el fin de controlar su gestión y políticas. - **Características:** - No participa directamente en actividades económicas operativas. - Controla más del 50% de derechos de voto. - **Ejemplo:** Grupo empresarial que posee varias empresas en diferentes sectores. **2. Subsidiarias** - **Definición:** Empresa controlada por una compañía controladora o matriz. - **Características:** - Operan de manera autónoma pero bajo la influencia de la matriz. - La matriz posee más del 50% de los votos. - **Ejemplo:** Empresa de tecnología en Colombia con propiedad mayoritaria extranjera. **3. Asociadas** - **Definición:** Empresa en la cual otra empresa tiene una influencia significativa, pero no control total. - **Características:** - Posee entre 20% y 50% de los derechos de voto. - Aplica método de participación en sus estados financieros. - **Ejemplo:** Empresa con 30% de participación en una start-up de energías renovables. **4. Filiales** - **Definición:** A menudo usada como sinónimo de subsidiaria, refiere a empresas controladas a un grado significativo. - **Características:** - Operan con cierta autonomía. - Controladas a través de participación significativa. - **Ejemplo:** Banco o compañía de seguros parte de un conglomerado. --- # **Conexiones entre conceptos** - **Compañías Controladoras** controlan **Subsidiarias**. - **Asociadas** representan influencia significativa pero no completa, conectándose sobre el umbral entre control total e inversión minoritaria. - **Filiales** usualmente se conectan bajo **Subsidiarias**, expandiendo el concepto a entidades con alto grado de control pero cierta autonomía.

A continuación abordaremos la siguiente inquietud: “¿Cuál es la diferencia entre una entidad asociada, una controlada y una subsidiaria?” Para dar respuesta a esta pregunta iniciamos mencionado que las controladas y las subsidiarias son el mismo tipo de entidad, en cuanto son entes sobre los cuales se tiene un control, que se refiere al poder que tiene una entidad sobre otra para inferir es sus decisiones. Si se está ante un nivel de control del 0 al 20 %, sobre una entidad no existe control ni influencia significativa, por tanto dicha inversión se reconoce como instrumento financiero y se medirá al costo o al valor razonable con base en los lineamientos de la sección 11 del Estándar para Pymes. Por otra parte, si se está ante un nivel de control mayor al 20 % y hasta el 50 %, existe una influencia significativa en la entidad, esto quiere decir que la entidad en la que se tiene participación es una asociada, sin embargo no se logra un poder total sobre la misma ya que las decisiones finales dependerán de las opiniones de otros participantes en conjunto. De otro lado, están los casos en los que se evidencia un nivel de control superior al 50 %, lo que quiere decir que hay un poder de decisión en la entidad, dado que sin importar lo que opinen otros participantes se tiene autoridad de decisión absoluta (control). Así pues, a las entidades en las que se tenga una participación de este tipo se les llamará subsidiarias o controladas. De acuerdo a lo expuesto por Juan David Maya, líder de investigación en Estándares Internacionales, a través de la figura expuesta en su respuesta Diferencia entre una entidad asociada, controlada y subsidiaria, la cual denominó “controlómetro”, se puede evidenciar fácilmente el nivel de control que se tiene sobre una entidad y de acuerdo a este verificar si la entidad en particular se consideraría controlada, subsidiaria o asociada.","output":"Basándonos en la información proporcionada y para organizarla de manera que se pueda conceptualizar en un \\"mapa conceptual\\", esencialmente estaríamos destacando los niveles de control y su impacto directo en la clasificación de las entidades como asociadas, controladas (o subsidiarias), o simplemente participaciones reconocidas como instrumentos financieros. A continuación, se muestra cómo se podría organizar esta información de manera esquemática. **Título del Mapa Conceptual:** Clasificación de Entidades según Nivel de Control 1. **Niveles de Control** - **0% a 20%**: No existe control ni influencia significativa. - **Clasificación**: Instrumento Financiero. - **Medición**: Al costo o valor razonable (Sección 11 Estándar para Pymes). - **Mayor de 20% hasta 50%**: Existe Influencia Significativa. - **Clasificación**: Entidad Asociada. - **Característica**: No poder total, decisiones en conjunto con otros participantes. - **Superior al 50%**: Poder de Decisión Absoluto. - **Clasificación**: Subsidiaria o Controlada. - **Característica**: Independencia en la toma de decisiones, sin importar opiniones de otros. 2. **Conceptos Clave** - **Control**: Poder para inferir en las decisiones de la entidad. - **Influencia Significativa**: Capacidad de participar en decisiones financieras y operativas sin control total. - **Instrumento Financiero**: Inversiones sin control ni influencia significativa. 3. **Controlómetro** (Herramienta Conceptual) - **Función**: Visualizar fácilmente el nivel de control. - **Aplicación**: Determinar si una entidad es controlada, subsidiaria o asociada. 4. **Ejemplos Prácticos** - **Inversiones hasta el 20%**: Portafolio de acciones diversificado sin participación activa en gestión. - **Participación del 25%**: Inversión en startup con derecho a participar en decisiones, sin dominio. - **Participación del 60%**: Adquisición de empresa en sector relacionado, con toma de decisiones unilateral. **Enlaces Claves** - Desde el **Nivel de Control** se enlaza a cada **Clasificación** con flechas que indican el umbral de porcentaje para influir en la categorización. - Cada **Clasificación** se conecta a sus respectivas **Características** y **Medición** (cuando aplicable), mostrando las implicaciones directas de cada nivel de control. - El **Controlómetro** actúa como núcleo conceptual, interconectando con ambos, los **Niveles de Control** y las **Clasificaciones**, proporcionando una herramienta visual para entender la relación entre el porcentaje de control e influencia.

Subordinación societaria. La subordinación se presenta cuando la empresa subordinada no puede tomar decisiones por sí sola, sino que depende de terceras empresas o personas que la controlan lo que les impide tomar decisiones autónomas. Señala el artículo 26 de la ley 222 de 1995, en la parte pertinente: «Una sociedad será subordinada o controlada cuando su poder de decisión se encuentre sometido a la voluntad de otra u otras personas que serán su matriz o controlante, …» Las empresas subordinadas se clasifican en filiales y en subsidiarias, conceptos que a continuación abordamos. Subsidiaria. Una empresa subsidiaria es aquella que está controlada indirectamente por la matriz o controlante, es decir, es control lo hace una tercera sociedad que a la vez es subordinada de la casa matriz. Es decir que la casa matriz no tiene acciones de forma directa en la subsidiaria, sino que controla a una tercera sociedad que sí las tiene. Si A que es la casa matriz, controla a B, y B a la vez controla a C, estamos ante una subsidiaria, toda vez que C está controlada por A, a través de B. Allí se presenta un control indirecto, de modo que la empresa C será una subsidiaria de A, en razón a que A no tiene acciones en C directamente. Filial. Una sociedad filial es la que está controlada directamente por la casa matriz, de manera que la casa matriz es propietaria directa de las acciones de la sociedad subordinada. Aquí no existe un tercero que sirva de intermediario para controlar la sociedad, sino que el controlo lo ejerce directamente la matriz. Supongamos las empresas, A, B y C, donde A es la casa matriz. Si A controla a C, C es una empresa filial de A. Lo que diferencia la filial de la subsidiaria. La única diferencia que hay entre la filial y la subsidiaria, es que en la subsidiaria el control no lo ejerce directamente la casa matriz, en tanto en la filial el control es directo, sin intermediarios. En los demás aspectos es igual, pues en los dos casos se requiere que la sociedad esté controlada por otra, de manera que no tenga autonomía para tomar decisiones. Se puede decir que tanto la filiar como la subsidiaria pertenecen a otra empresa más grande que se conoce como casa matriz, y requiere que esa casa matriz controle de forma directa o indirecta más del 50% de la sociedad, es decir, que debe ser propietaria de más del 50% de las acciones, pues de otra manera no podría ejercer control en las decisiones de la sociedad subordinada.","output":"Integrando la nueva información sobre la distinción entre filiales y subsidiarias en el contexto del derecho comercial o societario colombiano, y cómo estos conceptos encajan dentro de la estructura de control y subordinación empresarial, el mapa conceptual será actualizado y expandido para reflejar estas diferencias clave. **Título del Mapa Conceptual Actualizado:** Clasificación y Control de Entidades Corporativas en Colombia 1. **Niveles de Control y Subordinación Societaria** - **Control Directo e Indirecto** - Influencia y propiedad sobre decisiones y acciones. - **Subordinación Societaria (Ley 222 de 1995)** - Definición: Incapacidad de una empresa subordinada de tomar decisiones autónomas. 2. **Clasificación de Entidades según Nivel de Control** - **Instrumentos Financieros** - 0% a 20% de control: Sin control ni influencia significativa. - **Entidad Asociada** - Mayor de 20% hasta 50%: Influencia significativa pero sin control total. - **Subsidiaria o Controlada** - Superior al 50%: Poder de decisión absoluto. 3. **Diferenciación entre Filiales y Subsidiarias** - **Subsidiaria** - **Definición**: Controlada indirectamente por la matriz a través de otra sociedad subordinada. - **Ejemplo**: A (matriz) controla a B, y B controla a C; C es subsidiaria de A. - **Filial** - **Definición**: Controlada directamente por la casa matriz sin intermediarios. - **Ejemplo**: A (matriz) controla directamente a C; C es filial de A. - **Diferencia Clave**: La filial es controlada directamente y la subsidiaria, indirectamente. 4. **Conceptos Clave** - **Subordinación Societaria**: Depender de la decisión de una matriz o controlante. - **Directo vs. Indirecto**: La vía mediante la cual la casa matriz ejerce control sobre las sociedades subordinadas. - **Controlómetro**: Herramienta conceptual para visualizar el nivel de control. 5. **Detalles Legales y Requisitos** - **Ley 222 de 1995**: Marco legal para subordinación y control en Colombia. - **Requisito de Propiedad**: Más del 50% de participación para ejercer control. **Enlaces Claves**: - Del **Nivel de Control y Subordinación Societaria** se conecta a **Clasificación de Entidades** indicando la base legal y práctica para la clasificación. - **Clasificación de Entidades** enlaza a **Diferenciación entre Filiales y Subsidiarias** mostrando cómo la clasificación se detalla en el contexto de control empresarial. - Dentro de **Diferenciación entre Filiales y Subsidiarias**, se interrelaciona **Directo vs. Indirecto**, ilustrando la naturaleza del control ejercido.

If \\"Llama3\\" is a theoretical or newly released AI model, the hardware requirements would generally align with those for running substantial AI models or for utilizing AI-powered applications such as those based on OpenAI's GPT-3 or similar. However, assuming you're looking for general guidelines on the hardware needed to run high-performance AI models, here are some generalized hardware specifications that should support running intensive AI applications, keeping in mind that specific requirements can vary based on the exact nature of the tasks (e.g., simple queries vs. complex computations) and the efficiency of the model: 1. **CPU**: A modern multi-core processor (e.g., Intel i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 7/9) with a high clock speed. AI models can benefit from both strong single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. 2. **GPU**: A powerful GPU is often crucial for AI applications, especially those involving machine learning and deep learning. Nvidia GPUs are commonly preferred due to better support for CUDA, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model. A card from the NVIDIA RTX series (e.g., RTX 3060, RTX 3070, RTX 3080, or even the more powerful RTX 3090) would be very suitable. The exact GPU model would depend on the level of processing required and whether the AI model runs locally or if the GPU primarily accelerates other tasks while interacting with a cloud-based API. 3. **RAM**: The amount of RAM needed can vary widely. For running complex models locally, 16GB of RAM is a considered minimum, but 32GB or more is recommended for more intensive applications or development work. 4. **Storage**: SSD (Solid State Drive) is preferred for faster data access and overall system responsiveness. The size depends on your specific needs but consider at least 512GB. If working with vast datasets or many large models, 1TB or more is advisable. 5. **Network**: A stable and fast internet connection if you're accessing cloud-based AI services or downloading large datasets/models. 6. **Software**: Compatibility with software frameworks and APIs, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA, etc., depending on the specific AI model's requirements. It's important to note that if you're primarily using a cloud-based AI service, like OpenAI's GPT-3 via its API, the heavy computational lifting is done on the service provider's servers, and the hardware requirements on your end are much lower. In such cases, a stable internet connection and a reasonably modern computer should suffice. For the most accurate and updated information, always refer to the official documentation or announcements related to the specific AI model you're interested in running."},{"instruction":"translate this to persian: Everywhere Is Just One Place LET’S SAY YOU’VE HAD your great insight on the human condition. It’s about the desire for peace or happiness or tomato soup. Something major, anyway. You want to reach the largest possible audience, but PBS won’t give you a special. So you decide to write a novel to, you know, tell everybody a universal truth. Stop! Can’t be done. In the world of the novel, the universal doesn’t have a zip code. If you want to write about everywhere, you’ll have to stick to just one place. There are some medieval plays about the human condition, with names like Everyman and Mankind. Their heroes, whose names are the titles, are earnest representatives of us all—bland, generic, indistinguishable, and undistinguished. There’s a reason Stratford, Ontario, has a summer Shakespeare Festival and not a Medieval Morality Play Festival. There’s only one novel with any staying power that is overtly about a generic figure: John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress (1678). That’s short for The Pilgrim’s Progress from the World to That Which Is to Come, just so there’s no mistaking the didactic intent of the work. It details the journey of its hero, Christian, toward a place called the Celestial City. He’s helped on his way by characters called Evangelist and, well, Help, and impeded by Mr. Worldly Wiseman, Obstinate, Pliable, and Hypocrisy, among others. You get the drift. The problem, from a reader’s perspective, is that it’s an allegory. These aren’t characters or places but types, and not very interesting types, either. The names have had more lasting appeal than the things or persons to which they’re attached: Vanity Fair, the Slough of Despond, Doubter’s Castle, Giant Despair. As allegory, I suppose it does what Bunyan wanted it to do. As a novel, it just doesn’t get it. The characters lack depth or complexity, so the achievement of the journey and the places and people encountered are the only points of genuine interest. If you want tales of individual humans wrestling with their faith and with issues of right and wrong, you’ll find much more satisfying reading in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The House of the Seven Gables (1851) or The Scarlet Letter (1850). Hawthorne sometimes veers perilously close to allegory, but his people feel like real humans rather than cardboard cutouts, his ethical dilemmas genuinely troubling. And there’s the trouble with allegory: dull, stiff, two-dimensional. The allegorist means well, and he doesn’t want us to miss the point. The point, however, is usually all there is. The novel needs to be more dynamic if it wants to engage our attention and our emotions. It needs to present characters as rich and complex as those we believe ourselves to be, and they need to struggle with problems worth their effort—and ours. This richness, complexity, and individuation is what the novel’s best at. Yet novelists do sometimes want to write about “the human condition” or “the problem of the past” or any number of vexatious big themes. So, then, what to do? First of all, get a handle on the problem. Understand the twin, sometimes opposing, pulls of the local and the general. Here’s the Law of Universal Specificity: You can’t write about everywhere or everyone, only about one person or one place. If you want to write about everybody, start with one person, in one place, doing one real thing. Bellow’s Augie March, now there’s a guy— American, hustling, morally suspect, energetic, hopeful, a little out of control at times. Representative? You bet. But individuated, not quite like anybody else. You want to show the disillusionment and loss of World War I veterans? Jake Barnes. You want a place that stands for everyplace? Joyce’s Dublin. Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha. Erdrich’s reservation. Bellow’s Chicago. Melville’s ship. If you get the local and particular right, the universal will take care of itself. Partly, this is a no-brainer. You can’t describe everywhere. Where would you begin? How would it look? How many millions of pages is your novel, anyway? And what does everyone look like? So obviously the novelist can’t go in that direction and maintain anything like verisimilitude. Beyond that clear-cut problem, though, lurks a trickier one: how can you convey universality to your reader? How can you make sure that your characters stand for something like all of us?","output":"همه جا فقط یک جای است بیایید فرض کنیم که شما درک بزرگی از وضعیت انسانی به دست آورده‌اید. درباره‌ی آرزو برای صلح، خوشبختی یا سوپ گوجه‌فرنگی است. به هر حال، چیز مهمی است. شما می‌خواهید به بزرگ‌ترین مخاطب ممکن دست یابید، اما PBS به شما برنامه‌ی ویژه‌ای نخواهد داد. پس تصمیم می‌گیرید که یک رمان بنویسید تا، می‌دانید، یک حقیقت جهان‌شمول را به همه بگویید. نگه دارید! انجامش نمی‌شود. در دنیای رمان، جهان‌شمول نشانی پستی ندارد. اگر می‌خواهید درباره‌ی همه جا بنویسید، باید فقط به یک جا بپردازید. چند نمایش‌نامه‌ی قرون وسطایی درباره‌ی وضعیت انسانی وجود دارد، با نام‌هایی مانند هرمن و نوع بشر. قهرمانان آنها، که نام‌هایشان عنوان‌های آنها هستند، نمایندگان جدی ما همه هستند - خنثی، عمومی، تشخیص‌ناپذیر، و بی‌تمایز. دلیلی وجود دارد که استراتفورد، انتاریو، جشنواره‌ی تابستانی شکسپیر دارد و نه جشنواره‌ی نمایش‌های اخلاقی قرون وسطا. تنها یک رمان با قدرت ماندگاری وجود دارد که صراحتاً درباره‌ی یک شخصیت عمومی است: سفر زائر نوشته‌ی جان بانیان (۱۶۷۸). این مخفف سفر زائر از دنیا به آنچه که در آینده است، فقط برای این است که هیچ اشتباهی در مورد نیت آموزشی اثر وجود نداشته باشد. جزئیات سفر قهرمانش، مسیحی، به سمت مکانی به نام شهر آسمانی است. او در راه خود توسط شخصیت‌هایی مانند انجیل‌نویس و، خوب، کمک، یاری می‌شود و توسط آقای انسان دنیادوست، ازدیاد، منعطف، و ریاکار، در میان دیگران مانع ایجاد می‌شود. متوجه می‌شوید. مشکل، از دیدگاه یک خواننده، این است که یک ا allegory است. اینها شخصیت‌ها یا مکان‌ها نیستند بلکه انواعی هستند، و انواع چندان جالبی هم نیستند. نام‌ها جاذبه‌ی بیشتری نسبت به چیزها یا اشخاصی که به آنها متصل هستند داشته‌اند: نمایشگاه غرور، دلمردگی اسلاو، قلعه‌ی شک، غول ناامیدی. به عنوان یک ا allegory، فکر می‌کنم آنچه که بانیان می‌خواست انجام دهد را انجام می‌دهد. به عنوان یک رمان، فقط به آن نمی‌رسد. شخصیت‌ها عمق یا پیچیدگی ندارند، بنابراین دستاورد سفر و مکان‌ها و افرادی که با آنها روبرو می‌شوند تنها نقاط واقعی علاقه هستند. اگر داستان‌هایی درباره‌ی انسان‌های فردی که با ایمان خود و با مسائل درست و غلط کشتی می‌گیرند می‌خواهید، در خانه‌ی هفت پنجره‌ی ناتانیل هاثورن (۱۸۵۱) یا نامه‌ی قرمز (۱۸۵۰) خواندنی‌های بسیار راضی‌کننده‌تری پیدا خواهید کرد. هاثورن گاهی اوقات به شدت به allegory نزدیک می‌شود، اما آدم‌های او احساس می‌کنند مانند انسان‌های واقعی تر هستند تا برش‌های مقوایی، معضلات اخلاقی او واقعاً نگران‌کننده است. و این مشکل با allegory وجود دارد: کسل‌کننده، سفت، دوبعدی. allegorist خوب منظور دارد، و او نمی‌خواهد ما نکته‌ی اصلی را از دست بدهیم. نکته، با این حال، معمولاً همه چیزی است که وجود دارد. رمان باید پویاتر باشد اگر می‌خواهد توجه و احساسات ما را درگیر کند. نیاز به ارائه شخصیت‌هایی دارد که به غنی و پیچیده به اندازه‌ای که ما خودمان را باور داریم، و آنها باید با مشکلاتی دست و پنجه نرم کنند که ارزش تلاششان—و تلاش ما را داشته باشد. این غنایی، پیچیدگی، و تمایز فردی است که رمان بهترین در آن است. با این حال، رمان‌نویس‌ها گاهی اوقات می‌خواهند درباره‌ی “وضعیت انسانی” یا “مشکل گذشته” یا هر تعدادی از موضوعات بزرگ و دردسرساز بنویسند. پس، در این صورت، چه باید کرد؟ اول از همه، مشکل را درک کنید. دو کشش متقابل، گاهی اوقات مخالف، محلی و عمومی را درک کنید. اینجا قانون تخصص جهانی است: شما نمی‌توانید درباره‌ی همه جا یا همه کس بنویسید، فقط درباره‌ی یک شخص یا یک جا. اگر می‌خواهید درباره‌ی همه بنویسید، با یک شخص، در یک جا، که یک کار واقعی انجام می‌دهد، شروع کنید. اوگی مارچ بلو، حالا او یک پسر است - آمریکایی، دست و پا چلفتی، از نظر اخلاقی مشکوک، پرانرژی، امیدوار، گاهی اوقات کمی از کنترل خارج. نماینده؟ شرط می‌بندم. اما تمایز فردی، نه کاملاً مانند هیچ کس دیگری. شما می‌خواهید ناامیدی و از دست دادن سربازان جنگ جهانی اول را نشان دهید؟ جیک بارنز. شما می‌خواهید جایی که به جای هرجایی ایستاده است؟ دوبلین جویس. یوکناپاتوفای فاکنر. رزرواسیون اردریچ. شیکاگوی بلو. کشتی ملویل. اگر محلی و خاص را درست دریافت کنید، جهان‌شمول خود به خود رسیدگی می‌شود. بخشی از این، یک موضوع بدیهی است. شما نمی‌توانید همه جا را توصیف کنید. کجا شروع می‌کنید؟ چطور به نظر می‌رسد؟ چند میلیون صفحه رمان شما است، به هر حال؟ و همه چطور به نظر می‌رسند؟ پس واضح است که رمان‌نویس نمی‌تواند به آن سمت برود و هر چیزی شبیه به واقع‌نمایی را حفظ کند. فراتر از آن مشکل روشن، با این حال، یک مشکل پیچیده‌تر وجود دارد: چگونه می‌توانید جهان‌شمولی را به خواننده منتقل کنید؟ چگونه مطمئن می‌شوید که شخصیت‌های شما نماینده‌ی چیزی شبیه به همه‌ی ما هستند؟"},{"instruction":"and this: You can’t. Don’t even try. Don’t even think about it. And yet, it happens. Vive le paradoxe! And yet, as with most paradoxes, this one can be understood. I’ll let you think about it for a bit. (Hint: the answer’s not in the book.) Meanwhile, an example. Let’s say you want to write about a big event. A really big, earth-changing event. Something like, oh, Indian independence. At midnight on August 15, 1947, something on the order of half a billion people achieved their freedom from colonial rule. Now that’s big. Might even be worth writing about. Here’s the catch, though: how do you write about half a billion people? You don’t. You can’t. Even just saying the names would take thousands of pages. But you can write about one person. You can even give that one person a special trait, maybe connect him (it is a him) to a few others who share that trait. You could even have him be born on August 15, 1947. At midnight. He could be telepathically connected to others who share the moment of birth with him and the newly formed countries of India and Pakistan. That’s the conceit of Salman Rushdie’s brilliant evocation of the emerging nations in Midnight’s Children. His novel is a sprawling tragicomedy centered around Saleem Sinai, whose life and tangled fate parallels that of his country. The strategy proves a winner. Why? In part, we can follow the ups and downs of Saleem’s fate far better than those of a whole nation. Partly, too, by using Saleem, Rushdie can select those aspects of India’s entry into nationhood he wishes to emphasize; an individual life, however messy, is far tidier than the whole history of a country. Even if that history is very short. And finally, he tells a great story. The novel, because of its magical realist elements, is often compared to the work of Gabriel García Márquez. The greatest similarity between the two, however, is this localizing strategy, which also places them close to William Faulkner. Faulkner spoke repeatedly of his “little postage-stamp of ground,” Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. Like Rushdie, like García Márquez, Faulkner grappled with history, in his case one even more gnarled and thorny than theirs, entwined as it was with guilt, failure, pride, sin, and the inheritance of slavery. But he was too savvy to attempt to write about the entire South, or even the entire state. Rather, he whittled his concerns down to a single county, based on Lafayette County, where he lived in Oxford, the county seat and home of the University of Mississippi. Here, in The Sound and the Fury (1929), he created the Compsons, an aristocratic family on a downward spiral from the social prominence of the plantation and General Compson to grandsons Quentin, who commits suicide while a freshman at Harvard, and Benjy, the thirty-threeyear-old with the mind of a small child. In Go Down, Moses (1942), he tells the story of the McCaslins, descendants of a slaveholding family, and their longunacknowledged black cousins, the Beauchamps. In his Snopes trilogy, The Hamlet (1940), The Town (1957), and The Mansion (1959), he creates a far-flung family of ne’er-do-wells who actually do pretty well, winding up, sometimes in spite of themselves, owning pretty much the whole town. They seem to support a Faulknerian beatitude that the rascals shall inherit the earth. In novel after novel, he explores various aspects of Southern inheritance, always focusing on this one small parcel of land. García Márquez does much the same thing in One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), using the fictional coastal town of Macondo as a microcosm of postcolonial South America. Many events of the novel—civil war, the prevalence of the military, corrupt leadership, assassinations and massacres, the dominance of foreign companies (in this case, a multinational banana company) —resonate as elements of the history of many Latin American countries, yet it is the spectacular and singular nature of the town and its main family, the Buendías, that make the novel a permanent feature of readers’ memories. Everything about them is prodigious, from the tremendous age of the matriarch, Ursula, to Colonel Aureliano’s miraculous ability to escape death at the hands of others and even himself, to his brother José Arcadio’s male member, remarkable for its size and the fabulous tattoos with which it is adorned. Even the gypsy, Melquíades, who sets the family on the path to greatness and dissolution, is a figure of outsized accomplishments, claiming to have come back to life because death bored him. You’ve got to love a family like this one. Except that there is no family like this one. Part of García Márquez’s program is to create a family like no other. So how do we get from there to a pattern of experience that can stand for the whole of postcolonial Latin America? Ah, our para dox again. The solution, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars but in ourselves. The business of universality can’t be found in the text. If the writer tries to place it there, the work will almost automatically sound contrived. The writer’s job is to provide a story that engages, fascinates, provokes, and above all registers as unique. Robert McLiam Wilson subtitles his novel Eureka Street “A Novel of Ireland Like No Other.” That’s what every novel aspires to be, a work of fiction about x like no other. The novelist gets to create his story and to make it specific, particular, singular. Then he’s done. We readers get to decide on significance. We may decide that it’s genuinely universal in its depictions or themes, or that it’s not, or that it’s so poorly done that we don’t care one way or the other, or any of a hundred other determinations on many topics. To come back to Midnight’s Children, Saleem Sinai has to be, above all else, himself. Rushdie can supply hints or suggestions of a broader set of connections, as he does starting with the coincidence of Saleem’s birth. What he can’t do is make readers take those connections seriously. We decide that for ourselves. Does he represent some aspects of modern India? Which ones? In what ways? Do all novels aspire to universal themes? I don’t think so. There may be representative elements in character or situation, but a lot of novels are happy merely to tell their story. In fact, every novel needs first of all to be happy telling its story. If it doesn’t do that well, there’s not much chance it can speak to broader themes. But many novels do not seek to go beyond their story. The obvious but by no means only works here would be category or genre fiction, as if “literary” fiction didn’t belong to categories or genres. What these terms apply to are those novels that fall into one or another of the popular culture genres: mystery, thriller, horror, western, romance, science fiction, fantasy. Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade or Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe, for instance, can’t be said to stand for anyone beyond themselves or a sort of wish fulfillment of sure justice. The novels they occupy suggest certain aspects of the world: the prevalence of evil, the murky ethical realm where good guys and bad guys meet, or the improbable ratio of darkness to light even in sunny Los Angeles. Similarly, with horror novels, say, it’s tough to generalize from a demented car/canine/caretaker, nor is that really the point. The business of entertainments, after all, is to entertain. Even so, we can and do learn things from them. Not direct moral lessons, but more general implications about human behavior, the desire for justice, the need to be loved, or right conduct. We can’t help it; we are an inference-drawing species. Give us a particular and we’ll generalize from it. So almost any novel can teach us, and the novel has one big lesson that lies at its very root: we matter. A human life has value not because it belongs to an owner, a ruler, a collective, or a political party, but because it exists as itself. How is this in the novel form itself? It lies in the subject matter, which has to do with the little guy. Oh, you may find one or two novels that feature kings or princes or dauphins (real ones, not Twain’s), but nearly every novel that has ever been written is about an ordinary life, be it middle-class, working-class, or down and out. The people of the novel would have been very minor figures, had they appeared at all, in Homer or Shakespeare—a name to be killed off, a messenger racing to his master, a bit of comic stage business, no one to be taken seriously. And all those novels expect us to take an interest in the lives they present, to hang around till the end just to see what becomes of their chosen person. What’s more, we do. Do care, do follow with interest, do hang around to see the finish, big or small. Because they matter, we do. And that’s pretty universal.","output":"شما نمی‌توانید. حتی سعی هم نکنید. حتی به آن فکر هم نکنید. و با این حال، این اتفاق می‌افتد. زنده باد تناقض! و با این حال، همانطور که با بیشتر تناقضات است، این تناقض هم قابل درک است. من به شما فرصت می‌دهم که کمی درباره‌اش فکر کنید. (نکته: جواب در کتاب نیست.) در همین حال، یک مثال بزنیم. بگوییم شما می‌خواهید درباره یک رویداد بزرگ بنویسید. یک رویداد واقعاً بزرگ، که جهان را تغییر می‌دهد. چیزی مثل، آه، استقلال هند. در نیمه‌شب ۱۵ آگوست ۱۹۴۷، چیزی در حدود نیم میلیارد نفر آزادی خود را از حکومت استعماری به دست آوردند. حالا این بزرگ است. شاید حتی ارزش نوشتن را هم داشته باشد. اینجا چالش است، اما: چگونه می‌توانید درباره نیم میلیارد نفر بنویسید؟ شما نمی‌توانید. حتی فقط گفتن اسم‌ها هزاران صفحه طول می‌کشد. اما شما می‌توانید درباره یک نفر بنویسید. شما حتی می‌توانید به آن یک نفر یک ویژگی خاص بدهید، شاید او را (او یک مرد است) به چند نفر دیگر که آن ویژگی را دارند متصل کنید. شما حتی می‌توانید او را در ۱۵ آگوست ۱۹۴۷. در نیمه‌شب. به دنیا آورید. او می‌تواند ارتباط تله‌پاتیک با دیگرانی داشته باشد که لحظه‌ی تولد را با او و کشورهای تازه تشکیل‌شده‌ی هند و پاکستان به اشتراک می‌گذارند. این تفکرِ خلاقانه‌ی برجسته‌ی سلمان رشدی در بازآفرینی ملت‌های در حال ظهور در کودکان نیمه‌شب است. رمان او یک تراژدی‌کمدی پراکنده است که در اطراف سلیم سینایی متمرکز است، که زندگی و سرنوشت پیچیده‌اش با کشورش همپاره است. این استراتژی به عنوان یک برنده ثابت شده است. چرا؟ تا حدی، ما می‌توانیم فراز و نشیب‌های سرنوشت سلیم را خیلی بهتر از یک کشور کامل دنبال کنیم. به طور جزئی، همچنین با استفاده از سلیم، رشدی می‌تواند جنبه‌هایی از ورود هند به ملت‌داری را که می‌خواهد تاکید کند انتخاب کند؛ یک زندگی فردی، هر چند بهم‌ریخته، خیلی مرتب‌تر از کل تاریخ یک کشور است. حتی اگر آن تاریخ بسیار کوتاه باشد. و در نهایت، او یک داستان عالی می‌گوید. رمان، به خاطر عناصر واقع‌گرایی جادویی‌اش، اغلب با کارهای گابریل گارسیا مارکز مقایسه می‌شود. بزرگترین شباهت بین این دو، با این حال، این استراتژی تمرکزگرایی است، که آنها را نیز به ویلیام فاکنر نزدیک می‌کند. فاکنر بارها از \\"قطعه کوچک زمین خود\\"، شهرستان یوکناپاتافا، می‌سی‌سی‌پی صحبت کرده‌است. مانند رشدی، مانند گارسیا مارکز، فاکنر با تاریخ دست و پنجه نرم می‌کرد، در مورد خودش حتی پیچیده‌تر و خاردارتر از آنها، با گناه، شکست، غرور، گناه، و میراث برده‌داری در هم تنیده شده بود. اما او بسیار دانا بود که سعی کند درباره کل جنوب، یا حتی تمام ایالت بنویسد. بلکه، او نگرانی‌های خود را به یک شهرستان واحد، بر اساس شهرستان لافایت، جایی که در آکسفورد، مرکز شهرستان و خانه‌ی دانشگاه می‌سی‌سی‌پی زندگی می‌کرد، تقلیل داد. اینجا، در صدا و خشم (۱۹۲۹)، او خانواده‌ی کامپسون‌ها، یک خانواده‌ی اشرافی که از موقعیت اجتماعی نزول می‌کنند، از دوران اشرافیت و ژنرال کامپسون تا نوه‌ها؛ کوئنتین که در حالی که فرشته در دانشگاه هاروارد است خودکشی می‌کند، و بنجی، سی و سه ساله با ذهن کودک کوچکی. در برو پایین، موسی (۱۹۴۲)، او داستان خانواده مک‌کاسلین‌ها، نوادگان یک خانواده‌ی نگهدارنده‌ی برده، و بستگان سیاه پوست طولانی مدت نادیده گرفته‌شده‌شان، بوشام‌ها را می‌گوید. در سه‌گانه‌ی اسنوپس خود، حمله (۱۹۴۰)، شهر (۱۹۵۷)، و عمارت (۱۹۵۹)، او یک خانواده‌ی بسیار پراکنده از سودجویان را به وجود می‌آورد که در واقع خیلی خوب کار می‌کنند، گاهی اوقات علی‌رغم خودشان، تقریباً کل شهر را مال خود می‌کنند. آنها به نظر می‌رسد از یک beatitude فاکنری حمایت می‌کنند که کلاهبرداران باید زمین را به ارث ببرند. در رمان پس از رمان، او جنبه‌های مختلف میراث جنوبی را بررسی می‌کند، همیشه روی این قطعه کوچک زمین متمرکز می‌شود. گارسیا مارکز در صد سال تنهایی (۱۹۶۷) دقیقاً کار مشابهی انجام می‌دهد، با استفاده از شهر ساحلی خیالی ماکوندو به عنوان یک نمونه کوچک از آمریکای جنوبی پس از استعمار. بسیاری از رویدادهای رمان - جنگ داخلی، حاکمیت نظامی، رهبری فاسد، ترورها و کشتارها، سلطه‌ی شرکت‌های خارجی (در این مورد، یک شرکت موز چند ملیتی) - به عنوان عناصری از تاریخ بسیاری از کشورهای آمریکای لاتین طنین‌انداز هستند، اما این طبیعت خارق‌العاده و منحصر به فرد شهر و خانواده اصلی آن، بوئندیاها، است که رمان را به ویژگی دائمی حافظه‌ی خوانندگان تبدیل می‌کند. همه چیز در مورد آنها شگفت‌انگیز است، از سن عظیم مادربزرگ، اورسولا، تا توانایی معجزه‌آسای کلنل اورلیانو برای فرار از مرگ به دست دیگران و حتی خودش، تا عضو مردانه‌ی برادرش خوزه آرکادیو، که به خاطر اندازه‌اش و خالکوبی‌های افسانه‌ای که با آن تزئین شده است، معروف است. حتی جادوگر، ملکیادس، که خانواده را در مسیر عظمت و انحلال قرار می‌دهد، شخصیتی با دستاوردهای بزرگ است، مدعی است که به خاطر خسته کننده بودن مرگ دوباره به زندگی برگشته است. شما باید خانواده‌ای مانند این را دوست داشته باشید. به جز اینکه هیچ خانواده‌ای مانند این وجود ندارد. بخشی از برنامه‌ی گارسیا مارکز ایجاد یک خانواده مانند هیچ خانواده‌ی دیگری است. پس چگونه از آنجا به الگویی از تجربه می‌رسیم که می‌تواند برای کل آمریکای جنوبی پس از استعمار ایستادگی کند؟ آه، تناقض ما دوباره. راه حل، عزیزم بروتوس، در ستارگان ما نیست بلکه در خودمان است. کسب کار جهان‌شمولی در متن پیدا نمی‌شود. اگر نویسنده سعی کند آن را در آنجا قرار دهد، کار تقریباً به طور خودکار ساختگی به نظر می‌رسد. کار نویسنده ارائه یک داستان است که جذب کننده، جالب، تحریک‌آمیز، و بالاتر از همه، منحصر به فرد ثبت شود. رابرت مک‌لیام ویلسون عنوان فرعی رمان خود، خیابان یورکا را \\"رمانی از ایرلند مانند هیچ کدام دیگر\\" قرار می‌دهد. این چیزی است که هر رمان به دنبال آن است، یک اثر داستانی درباره‌ی x مانند هیچ کدام دیگر. نویسنده رمان داستان خود را می‌سازد و آن را خاص، منحصر به فرد، متمایز می‌کند. سپس او کارش تمام است. ما خوانندگان تصمیم می‌گیریم در مورد اهمیت آن. ممکن است تصمیم بگیریم که این به طور واقعی در نمایش‌ها یا موضوعاتش جهان‌شمول است، یا اینکه نیست، یا اینکه به قدری بد انجام شده است که ما به هر طریقی اهمیتی نمی‌دهیم، یا هر یک از صدها تعیین دیگر در موضوعات زیادی. برای بازگشت به کودکان نیمه‌شب، سلیم سینایی باید، بالاتر از همه چیز، خودش باشد. رشدی می‌تواند نشانه‌ها یا پیشنهادهایی از یک مجموعه وسیع‌تر از ارتباطات را ارائه دهد، همانطور که او با تصادف تولد سلیم شروع می‌کند. آنچه که او نمی‌تواند انجام دهد این است که خوانندگان را مجبور کند که"},{"instruction":"and this: To come back to Midnight’s Children, Saleem Sinai has to be, above all else, himself.

Can I get elbow bursitis for excessive training? Also, can I just rest until it heals?","output":"Yes, excessive training can indeed lead to elbow bursitis, especially activities that involve repetitive motion or direct pressure on the elbow. Bursitis is inflammation of the bursa, which is a small, fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion between bones and soft tissues in the body. The elbow is a common site for bursitis due to the presence of several bursae in the area, with the olecranon bursa being the most commonly affected. Activities that might contribute to elbow bursitis include repetitive movements (such as throwing or other overhead sports), prolonged pressure from leaning on hard surfaces, or direct trauma to the elbow. Athletes, manual laborers, and individuals engaging in specific types of workouts that put undue stress on the elbow joints are more susceptible to developing bursitis. Regarding treatment and recovery, rest is indeed a crucial element. You may observe several strategies to manage elbow bursitis effectively: 1. **Rest and Activity Modification:** Limiting the activities that aggravate your elbow and giving it time to heal is paramount. This might mean adjusting your training routine or avoiding certain movements that put extra stress on your elbow. 2. **Ice Therapy:** Applying ice to the affected area can help reduce inflammation and pain. This is often recommended for 20 minutes several times a day, especially after activities that involve elbow use. 3. **Compression and Elevation:** Using an elbow wrap or brace can provide support and reduce swelling. Elevation can also help with reducing swelling by encouraging fluid drainage away from the elbow. 4. **Medications:** Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications (like ibuprofen or naproxen) can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. However, these should be used cautiously and under the guidance of a physician, especially if there's a need for long-term use. 5. **Physical Therapy:** Once the acute inflammation has subsided, physical therapy exercises might be recommended to strengthen the muscles around the elbow and decrease the load on the bursa. 6. **Occupational Modifications:** If your job involves actions that aggravate the condition, occupational changes or the use of protective gear might be necessary. Most cases of bursitis can be effectively treated with these conservative measures. However, in some instances, if there's no improvement or if there is significant fluid accumulation (aspiration might be indicated), or infection (antibiotic therapy might be needed), further medical intervention would be required. Surgical options are considered only in chronic or refractory cases. Consult with a healthcare professional or a specialist in sports medicine for a tailored treatment plan. They can assess the severity of your condition, offer more specific treatment advice, and guide you through your recovery process."},{"instruction":"напиши мне краткий уникальный промт используя леттеринг для создания логотипа \\"Portfolio\\" уникальны шрифтом","output":"Создайте логотип для слова \\"Portfolio\\", используя уникальный подход к леттерингу.

Here are a few notable examples: 1. **Barney Stinson - \\"How I Met Your Mother\\"**: Initially, Barney (played by Neil Patrick Harris) was just one of Ted's friends, but his larger-than-life personality, catchphrases, and mysterious job made him a fan favorite. Over time, his character received more focus and a deeper backstory. 2. **Steve Urkel - \\"Family Matters\\"**: As mentioned, Urkel, portrayed by Jaleel White, was intended to be a one-time guest character. However, his quirky mannerisms and catchphrase \\"Did I do that?\\" quickly made him the centerpiece of the show. 3. **Fonzie - \\"Happy Days\\"**: Arthur Fonzarelli, better known as \\"Fonzie\\" or \\"The Fonz,\\" played by Henry Winkler, was not the main character when \\"Happy Days\\" first aired. Originally centered around Richie Cunningham and his family, Fonzie's charisma and catchphrases like \\"Ayyy!\\" quickly made him a cultural phenomenon, and the show began to focus more on his adventures. 4. **Jesse Pinkman - \\"Breaking Bad\\"**: Aaron Paul's character, Jesse Pinkman, was originally slated to be killed off at the end of the first season. However, Paul's performance and the chemistry with Bryan Cranston's Walter White made him an integral part of the series, ultimately shaping its direction significantly. 5. **Castiel - \\"Supernatural\\"**: Introduced in the fourth season, the angel Castiel, played by Misha Collins, was only meant to be a temporary character. However, his popularity with fans ensured his stay, making him a series regular and a pivotal figure in the storyline. 6. **Spike - \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\"**: Spike, played by James Marsters, was introduced in the second season as a villain. His character was supposed to be a short-lived antagonist, but he became so popular with fans that he ended up being a critical part of the series, transforming from villain to anti-hero to hero. These characters showcase how dynamic audience reception can influence the evolution of television series, turning supporting or minor roles into central figures that define the show's legacy."},{"instruction":"Weist du wie die audials api aussieht?","output":"Bis zu meinem letzten Wissensstand im Jahr 2023 habe ich keine spezifischen oder detaillierten Informationen über eine öffentlich zugängliche API von Audials.

Underwater environments are characterized by distinct lighting, color absorption, and distortion effects due to the water's properties. Here's how you can create a simple underwater shader. **Step 1: Setting up the URP Environment** First, ensure your project is using the Universal Render Pipeline. If it's not, you can set it up by going to \`Edit > Project Settings > Graphics\` and selecting the Universal RP in the Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings. If you haven't already imported URP into your project, you can do so through the Unity Package Manager. **Step 2: Creating a Shader Graph** 1. Go to \`Assets > Create > Shader > Universal Render Pipeline > Shader Graph\` to create a new Shader Graph asset. 2. Double-click the newly created Shader Graph asset to open it in the Shader Editor. **Step 3: Building the Underwater Shader** You're going to create a shader that simulates being underwater. We will focus on a simple color modification and distortion effect for this purpose. # **3.1 Color Modification** Water absorbs light and color in a depth-dependent manner, usually blue or green hues are more prominent. - Create a \`Color\` node for both shallow (near the surface) and deep (further down) water colors. Set these to shades of blue or green. - Use a \`Gradient\` node or a custom function to interpolate between these colors based on the depth, which could be a function of the Y-coordinate of your object or camera. # **3.2 Distortion Effect** The light rays bend when moving through water due to refraction, creating a distinctive distortion effect. - Use the \`Screen Position\` node and \`Tiling and Offset\` node to create a basic distortion. You can manipulate the UVs of your scene's screen position to achieve this. - Add a \`Time\` node to animate the distortion effect over time by adding it to the \`Tiling and Offset\` node's offset. - Combine this with a \`Normal Vector\` node or a custom noise texture to simulate water ripples or waves influencing the distortion. **Step 4: Applying the Shader** 1. Save your Shader Graph and return to the Unity Editor. 2. Create a new Material by right-clicking in the Assets folder and selecting \`Create > Material\`. 3. Assign your new shader to this material by clicking on the shader dropdown in the material settings and navigating to Shader Graphs, then selecting your created shader. 4. Apply this material to a fullscreen quad or an image effect if you're trying to affect the whole screen to simulate being underwater. **Keep in Mind**: This is a basic start and will need adjustments based on your specific needs, such as integrating with your game's physics for underwater movement, adding bubbles or particles for realism, and potentially incorporating post-processing effects for blurring or light scatter to enhance the underwater feel. For more complex effects, such as caustics (the light patterns created on the ocean floor), you might need to use more advanced techniques or shaders specifically designed for those purposes. The Unity Asset Store is also a valuable resource for pre-built shaders and tools that can help achieve a more realistic underwater environment."},{"instruction":"Can you write a realistic underwater shader for me please?","output":"Creating a realistic underwater shader from scratch in a textual format presents some limitations, especially without knowing the specific tools or versions you're working with.

「いろいろな生産部面での剩余価値の平均利潤への平均化が，人為的または自然的な独占，（······）という障害にぶつかって，そのために，独占の作用を受ける商品の生産価格をも価値をも越えるような独占価格が可能になるとしても，商品の価値によって与えられている限界がそれによって解消されることにはならないであろう。ある商品の独占価格は，ただ，他の商品生産者たちの利潤の一部分を，独占価格をもつ商品に移すだけであろう。間接的にはいろいろな生産部面のあいだでの剰余価値の分配に局部的な攪乱が生じることもあるであろうが，この攪乱もこの剩余価値そのものの限界を変えはしないであろう。もし独占価格をもつ商品が労働者の必要消費にはいるとすれば，その商品は労賃を高くし，したがって剩余価値を減らすであろう。といっても，そうなるのは，労働者がこれまで通りに自分の労働力の価値を支払ってもらう場合のことであるが。その商品が労賃を労働力の価値よりも低く押し下げることもあるであろらが，そうなるのは，ただ，労賃がその肉体的最低限界よりも上にある限りでのことである。このような場合には，独占価格は，実質労賃（すなわち労働者が同じ量の労働によって受け取れるであろう使用価値の量）からの控除や他の資本家たちの利潤からの控除によって支払われることになるであろう」。 このような独占価格についての定義にしたがって，ヒルファーディングや他のマルクス主義的な理論家たちは独占理論を展開しようとした。独占と競争，独占的に支配されている生産セクターと非独占的生産セクターは，それゆえ相互に制約しあう二つの概念である。独占は競争，つまり非独占的な生産セクターが存在するがゆえにのみ存立する。特定の再生産体系における独占化の進行の程度に応じて社会的総剰余価値の分割がすすめば，労働力商品の価格はその価値以下におしさげられるか，そしてあるいは非独占的個別資本の利潤の犠牲に関連づけられる。なぜならば独占は相互に，一つの独占の独占価格をそっくり自らが生産した商品の費用価格プラス独占価格に順次にたらい回しすることができる立場にあるからである。つまり，なるほど非独占的資本家たちは，独占価格によって費用価格をつりあげられているが，しかし彼らは独占価格を創り出す立場にないし，その結果，彼らの商品の市場価格は絶えず生産価格を下まわることとなる。 2） ヴィゴツキーがつぎのように指摘したのは正当である。つまり独占利潤が存立するためには社会全体の剰余価値の分割を唯一の条件とするだけでは不十分であること，換言すれば，彼が述べているように，独占企業と非独占的企業との間の総利潤の分割過程は二次的な役割しかもたないということの指摘である。 「高独占利潤は生産過程，つまり市場価値の形成過程において創出される。独占的剩余利潤の基礎は，大企業や巨大企業が部門内における競争過程において，つまり超過利潤の偶然的現象から独占の継続的な特権への転換を通して，超過利潤を確定していくことの中にある」。 同一の生産セクター内における個別資本の超過利潤は市場価格の概念に含まれる。市場価値はある生産部門の商品量に応じた個々の商品価値の総計である。しかしながらある部門の個々の商品価値は，商品が製造される場合の生産性水準に応じて異なる。 「いま，比較的小さい一部分はこの条件よりもわるい条件で生産され，他の一部分はそれよりもよい条件で生産されており，したがって一方の部分の個別的価値はこの商品の大きな部分の中位的価値よりも大きく，他方の一部分の個別的価値はこの中位的価値よりも小さいが，しかしこの両極は平均されて，両極に属する商品の平均価値は中位の大量に属する商品の価値に等しいとすれば，その場合には，市場価値は中位の条件のもとで生産された商品の価値によって規定されている」。 平均的な資本家よりも有利な諸条件のもとで生産しているすべての資本家たちは超過利潤を収得する。しかしながら，この超過利潤は自由競争という条件の下では一時的なものに留まる。というのは，同じ生産セクター内の他の資本家たちもより高い生産性水準に到達しようとするので，その結果超過利潤の成因が除去されえるからである。つまり，すでに有利な諸条件のもとで生産している資本は，この生産性の優位を維持，あるいは創出しようとするだろうことは当然明らかである。-かかる資本は超過利潤の実現のゆえにそのための最高の前提を有しているのである。かくしてより高い有機的構成をもつ個別資本は集積化，集中化の過程を通じて資本の流動性の限界につきあたる。-ここに独占的生産セクターが成立する。 独占は高度な価格水準に利害関心をもつ。労働生産力の上昇は市場価格のひき下げにはつながらないのが普通である。生産性の優位は，パテントへの支配権や道徳的磨滅の強要によって確立されるいわば技術進歩の独占化へと仕上げられる。大企業内における個別経費は，ヴィゴツキーによれば，平均的企業内のそれよりおよそ25％だけ少ないし，零細企業におけるより，およそ30％だけ少ない。 現存の生産能力を放棄しないことが独占価格の体系を維持するもっとも重要な手段の一つである。 「独占資本主義においては生産経費のもつ価格決定要因としての性格は本質的に修正される。ここでは，原材料や部品等々のかなりの部分は本来の価格ではなく独占価格で販売に移される。つまり通例生産経費は，はじめから独占的に規定された経費として作用する。だから，基金や材料の集約性が沈下するとしても，そのことがそのまま〔in natura］製品単位ごとの価値量の沈下を意味しないという結果がもたらされる。」”翻译为中文","output":"由于生产的社会化不断地进入更高的阶梯，因而产生了对资本流动的困难，这在一般情况下，为了获得利润和竞争力，就必须对已经社会化的技术结构进行补充，特别是在新建生产设施时，困难性会更大。即，新建具有高度有机构成的生产设施通常需要巨额的资本，这些资本只有大型单个资本或是资本企业联合才能筹集到。我们称能够打破平均利润均衡化过程的单个资本为垄断。因此，垄断可以为自己的商品实现市场价格，这一价格不是围绕生产价格波动，而是不断超过生产价格。垄断的意义在于实现具有垄断性质的垄断价格，即垄断利润。我们在这里理解的垄断价格，不是由特定时间借出的资本量所决定，而是依据特定再生产体系内部的垄断程度，作为社会总剩余价值分配的结果来实现。垄断虽然对平均利润率形成的机制进行了修正，但并没有废弃价值规律及剩余价值规律。 在各个生产部门的剩余价值向平均利润的均化过程中，可能会遇到人为或自然的垄断等障碍，因而可能产生超过商品的生产价格和价值的垄断价格，但这并不意味着由商品价值所设定的限制因此而消除。某商品的垄断价格只是将其他商品生产者的部分利润转移到具有垄断价格的商品上。间接地，可能会在不同生产部门间的剩余价值分配中造成局部混乱，但这不会改变这些剩余价值本身的限制。如果具有垄断价格的商品成为工人的必需消费品，则这种商品会提高工资，从而减少剩余价值。但这仅在工人继续按照其劳动力价值获得报酬的情况下发生。商品也可能将工资压低到劳动力价值以下，但这只会在工资高于其生理最低限度时发生。在这种情况下，垄断价格将通过从实际工资（即工人通过相同量的劳动能够获得的使用价值量）和其他资本家的利润中扣除来支付。 根据这种对垄断价格的定义，希尔费定和其他马克思主义理论家试图发展垄断理论。垄断和竞争，以及受垄断主导的生产部门和非垄断生产部门，因此是相互制约的两个概念。垄断只有在存在竞争，即存在非垄断生产部门的条件下才能存在。随着特定再生产体系中垄断化的进程，依据社会总剩余价值的分割，劳动力商品的价格会被压低到其价值以下，或者与非垄断个别资本的利润牺牲相关联。因为垄断能够相互地，将一个垄断的垄断价格完全地转嫁到自己生产的商品的费用价格加上垄断价格上。即，非垄断资本家虽然被垄断价格提高了成本价格，但他们不在创造垄断价格的位置上，结果，他们的商品市场价格将不断低于生产价格。 2） 维果茨基指出的是正当的，即为了垄断利润的存在，仅将社会总剩余价值的分配作为唯一条件是不够的，换句话说，就像他所表述的，垄断企业和非垄断企业之间总利润的分配过程只具有次要作用。 “高垄断利润是在生产过程中，即市场价值形成过程中创造出来的。垄断性剩余利润的基础在于，大企业或巨大企业在部门内的竞争过程中，即通过偶然现象的超额利润向垄断的持续特权转变中，确定超额利润。” 同一生产部门内个别资本的超额利润被包含在市场价格的概念中。市场价值是按照某生产部门商品数量对应的各个商品价值的总和。然而，某个部门的各个商品的价值根据商品生产时的生产率水平而有所不同。 “现在，相对较小的一部分在比这个条件更差的条件下生产，另一部分在更好的条件下生产，因此一部分的个别价值比这个商品的大部分的中等价值要大，另一部分的个别价值比这个中等价值要小，但是如果这两极被平均化，属于两极的商品的平均价值等于属于大量中等商品的价值的话，那么市场价值就是由中等条件下生产的商品的价值来决定的。” 所有在比平均条件更有利条件下生产的资本家都将获得超额利润。然而，在自由竞争条件下，这种超额利润只是暂时的。因为同一个生产部门内的其他资本家也会努力达到更高的生产力水平，结果超额利润的成因被消除。即，已经在有利条件下生产的资本将会努力维持或创造这种生产力优势是显而易见的。-这种资本由于实现超额利润而拥有最佳前提。因此，具有更高有机构成的个别资本通过资本的积累和集中化过程遇到了资本流动性的限制。-这里就形成了垄断性生产部门。 垄断对于高价位水平有利益关心。劳动生产力的提升通常不会导致市场价格下降。生产力优势，通过对专利的控制权和道德折旧的强制等，成为了技术进步的垄断化完成。据维果茨基说，大企业内的个别经费比平均企业内的约少25％，比微型企业内的约少30％。 不放弃现有产能是维持垄断价格体系的最重要手段之一。 “在垄断资本主义中，作为价格决定因素的生产费用的性质本质上被修改了。这里，原材料和部件等的相当部分不是以原始价格而是以垄断价格进行销售。即，通常生产费用作为一开始就被垄断性决定的费用而起作用。所以，即使资金或材料的集约性下降，这也不会直接导致产品单位价值量的降低。”"},{"instruction":"请将“上述の諸要因に，労働強化による搾取率の増大もまた，独占価格決定の要因として加えられる。これらの要因は市場価格上昇の原因をなし，また市場価値の枠組みの中での超過利潤の構造的な固定化を可能とする。独占価格ならびに独占利潤は市場価値の基礎の上に成立し，市場価値枠組の中で実現される。 3）二つの要因-独占化の程度に応じての社会的総剰余価値の配分と市場価値枠組の中での超過利潤の構造的固化-は，独占の経済的基礎である独占価格を基本的に規定する。独占とは，その概念に照応する資本の機能メカニズムにおける一時的な攪乱のみを意味するのではなく，むしろまたこの機能メカニズムの質的変化を示すものである。資本流動性の制限によって，同量の資本で同量の利潤を生み出すことを保証する均衡化過程は構造的に攪乱される。まさにこの均衡化過程は全生産セクターに均等に割り当てられた労働の社会化を生ぜしめる。ところがこの過程の持続的な妨害によって，さまざまな生産セクターにおける生産性水準の不可逆的落差や一つのセクター内部での落差が進行する。再生産体系内部における経済的発展の力学の不均衡性は独占によって特質づけられた資本主義的生産過程の特徴的な標識である。 このような事情から必然的な結果として国家装置の機能拡大がもたらされざるをえない。したがって，国家理論の基本的な諸規定は，資本主義的な再生産過程の機能メカニズムの質的変化を背景として修正されなければならない。われわれは独占を資本主義的蓄積過程の中心的矛盾から生じる運動形態として叙述してきた。その矛盾とは，一方における労働の社会化への絶対的傾向と，他方でのこの傾向が完遂される基盤の偏狭さ，つまり資本の自己増殖化との矛盾である。この矛盾は独占において，運動の自由をつぎのようにして獲得する。 まず，生産経費の切り下げ，不変資本の節約化，原材料生産の統御，搾取率の引き上げ，技術的進歩の強行的適用等によって。つぎに，非独占的資本家たちや他の諸階級，諸階層から独占価格という形をとってのいわば貢物が徴収されふんだくられることによって。 われわれは第一節で，国家概念の中には概念に媒介されて現実性が獲得されていく過程において，三つの相異なった具体的段階が揚棄されていることを明示した。また，資本の再生産過程で賃労働-資本関係は搾取関係として相互に再生産されるということも示された。独占によっていまやこの資本主義的再生産体系の機能メカニズムの諸条件は変容させられる。独占は賃労働-資本関係に響影をおよぼさぬわけにはいかない。つまりいまや労働力商品は，自由競争下の資本主義においてよりもはるかに強く国家の媒介によって再生産されるのである。労働の不断にますます増大していく部分を，労働者が個人的に処理するのではなく，社会的ないし国家的諸制度がそれを処理するのである。 独占によって構造的に攪乱された再生産過程は，もちろん労働力商品の再生産領域においてのみ国家の媒介的規制を必要とするのではない。たとえば国家財政体系はつぎのような課題を負っている。つまり，資本の価値増殖にとって有益ではないが，それにもかかわらず再生産過程総体にとってまさに素材補塡としてもまた，不可欠な生産諸セクターを国営で運営し，生み出される赤字を社会化すること，換言すれば，赤字を租税制度によって均等化するという課題，あるいは，このようなセクターを私的資本の処理にまかせはするが，それを税割引，有利な信用，助成金，国家的に保証されたきわめて高価格での商品販売といった形態であれ，あるいは武器生産のような国家的に誘導された生産を通してであれ，租税手段によって援助するという課題である。 社会的剰余生産物の租税による流動化は，ただ価値増殖の視点から収益性の低い資本を援助するだけではなく，独占利潤を収奪しうる立場に断然立っている資本をもまた，援助する配分過程でもある。援助するかいなかの基準は，その企業のもつ当該再生産体系および外国貿易における地位と機能から与えられる。つまり，その再生産過程が外国貿易に依存する度合に応じて，外国貿易の拡大の諸条件を形成している企業に有利なような社会的剩余生産物の配分がもたらされなければならない。このことは以下のことを意味している。すなわち，国家装置はなるほど一国的生産物のますます増大する部分をわがものとするが，けっして自由にはこの手段を使用しえない。つまり，この配分過程はそれ自身，再生産体系の構造やそこから発展してくる矛盾によって規定されるのである。この両者-構造と矛盾-は資本主義の自然史から生じるのである。 3 価値理論と国家支出 I『経済学批判』カテゴリーの再構成の現代における必要性 第二次世界大戦後の急速な経済成長と労働運動の危機は，マルクス主義の資本蓄積理論と恐慌理論に実践的に反論するものであるように思われた。ヨーロッパと日本における「経済奇跡」は資本主義的世界体制における安定と発展の新たな，息の長い局面の証拠とみなされた。なるほど，このあらたな発展局面は資本主義の根本的な構造変化に伴われていたが，急速な経済成長は 体制の完全さを的確に証明しているようにみえた。生産諸力の自由な発展が30年代の大恐慌をもたらしたという事実は，あきらかにただひとつの認識を導きだしただけである。その認識とは，「有効需要」の不足によって経済活動が停滞したときには，再活性化させうるような調整が必要だというものである。妨げられない自由主義的資本主義はおそかれ早かれ，再び不況と失業をもたらすであろうが，これと反対に，適切な程度の国家の介入によって支えられた資本主義は，成長と繁栄の新局面をきりひらくであろう，と。ケインズの『一般理論』が外見上，ひとつの新しい経済政策実践のための科学的基礎を提供したのだった。 しかし，そのことによって階級闘争への恐れは追いはらわれはしなかった。完全雇用が新たな枠組の経済理論と経済政策の第一に据えられたという事実は，そのことでもう，労働者の闘争の再燃に対する予防措置がなお必要であるとみなされたことの証明だった。けれども根本においては，労働者の活性化に対するブレーキとなるのに新規の非常に急激な資本蓄積の増大以上のものは存在しなかった。いずれにせよ，完全雇用はのぞましいことに思われた。というのは，完全雇用は多大な剩余価値生産をもたらすであろうし，それを国家が自らの活動のための基金として利用しらるであろうからである。したがって完全雇用は資本それ自体の発展戦略にとって本質的なキー要素であった。 こうした点を背景にして，「マルクスを論駁する事実」を列挙することも，理論的に「反論すること」もかなりの信憑性をもっているように思われた。蓄積論と恐慌論を中心にしているマルクスの説は一見，現実性をほとんど失ってしまったかのようであった。マルクスにとって「近代の経済学でもっとも重要な法則」である利潤率の傾向的低下の理論と経済恐慌の理論は多かれ少なかれ明示的に放棄された。こうして，経済学批判は意義を失い，ブルジョア経済学の多少とも「マルクスがかった」説明にとってかわられるか，単なるイデオロギー批判にされてしまうかというようなことが可能とされたのである。”翻译为中文","output":"由于工作强化导致剥削率增加，这也作为垄断定价的因素之一被加入。这些因素构成了市场价格上升的原因，并使得在市场价值框架中超额利润的结构性固化成为可能。垄断价格以及垄断利润建立在市场价值的基础之上，并在市场价值框架中实现。 两个因素-根据垄断化程度对社会总剩余价值的分配和在市场价值框架中超额利润的结构性固化-基本上决定了垄断的经济基础，即垄断价格。垄断意味着资本功能机制中的一种暂时混乱，并且，这种功能机制的质的变化。资本流动性的限制结构性地混乱了保证相同量的资本产生相同量利润的均衡化过程。正是这种均衡化过程使得工作的社会化均等地分配到所有生产部门。然而，这一过程的持续干扰导致了不同生产部门间以及单一部门内部生产率水平的不可逆落差。再生产体系内部经济发展动力的不平衡性是由垄断特征的资本主义生产过程的特征性标志。 由于这种情况，国家机构功能的扩张成为必然结果。因此，国家理论的基本规定必须在资本主义再生产过程功能机制的质的变化背景下进行修正。我们已经描述了垄断作为资本主义积累过程中心矛盾所产生的运动形式。这一矛盾是绝对趋势的社会化劳动与这一趋势实现的基础的局限性，即资本的自我增殖化之间的矛盾。垄断通过以下方式获得运动的自由： 首先，通过降低生产成本、节约不变资本、控制原材料生产、提高剥削率、强制技术进步等方式。其次，通过从非垄断资本家和其他阶级、阶层以垄断价格形式征收某种形式的贡品。 在第一节中，我们明确了国家概念的具体阶段在通过概念媒介获得现实性的过程中被消除了。还表明，资本的再生产过程中，雇佣劳工-资本关系作为相互再生产的剥削关系。现在，这种资本主义再生产体系的功能机制的条件被垄断所改变。垄断不可能不影响雇佣劳工-资本关系。也就是说，劳动力商品现在被国家的媒介更强烈地再生产，而不是在自由竞争下的资本主义中。劳动的越来越大的部分，不是由工人个人处理，而是由社会或国家机构来处理。 由于垄断结构性地混乱了再生产过程，当然，不仅仅是劳动力商品的再生产领域需要国家的媒介性调节。例如，国家财政体系承担着这样的任务：即运行对资本价值增长不利但对于整个再生产过程仍绝对必要的生产部门，通过社会化产生的赤字，换言之，通过税收制度均衡化赤字的任务；或者，将这些部门留给私人资本处理，但通过税收折扣、有利信贷、补贴、以非常高的价格销售经国家保证的商品等方式，或通过类似武器生产这样的国家引导生产来支持的任务。 社会剩余产品通过税收的流动化，不仅仅是为视角下收益性低的资本提供支援，而且还是分配过程，也支援了处于断然有利地位以剥夺垄断利润的资本。支持与否的标准是由该企业在再生产体系及对外贸易中的地位和功能决定的。也就是说，再生产过程依赖于对外贸易的程度，应该为那些形成对外贸易扩张条件的企业带来有利的社会剩余产品分配。这意味着，尽管国家机构确实拥有越来越大部分的国家生产物，但绝不能自由使用这些手段。也就是说，这种分配过程本身是由再生产体系的结构和从中发展出来的矛盾所决定的。这两者-结构和矛盾-是资本主义自然史的产物。 价值理论与国家支出 I 对“经济学批评”范畴重新构建的当代必要性 二战后的快速经济增长和劳动运动的危机似乎对马克思主义的资本积累理论和恐慌理论提出了实践性的反驳。欧洲和日本的“经济奇迹”被视为资本主义世界体系稳定和发展的新的长期阶段的证据。确实，这个新发展阶段伴随着资本主义的根本结构变化，但快速经济增长似乎准确证明了体制的完整性。30年代大萧条引发的自由发展生产力的事实仅导致了一个认识，即当经济活动因“有效需求”不足而停滞时，需要进行调整以重新激活。不受阻碍的自由主义资本主义迟早会再次带来衰退和失业，相反，受到恰当程度国家干预支持的资本主义将开启增长和繁荣的新阶段。凯恩斯的《通论》在表面上为一种新的经济政策实践提供了科学基础。 然而，这并未消除对阶级斗争的恐惧。完全就业被作为新经济理论和政策框架的首要任务，事实上，这证明了仍然需要对工人斗争的再燃采取预防措施。但在根本上，没有什么比新一轮极为迅速的资本积累增长更能成为抑制工人活跃性的制动器。无论如何，完全就业被视为理想之事，因为完全就业将产生大量剩余价值，并且国家可以将其作为自己活动的基金。因此，完全就业成为资本本身发展战略的本质关键。 在这种背景下，“驳斥马克思”的事实和理论“反驳”看起来具有相当的可信度。马克思关于蓄积和恐慌的论述似乎几乎失去了现实性。马克思认为的“现代经济学中最重要的法则”，即利润率倾向性下降理论和经济恐慌理论或多或少被明确放弃。因此，经济学批判似乎失去了意义，被布尔什维克经济学中稍有“马克思色彩”的解释所替代，或简化为单纯的意识形态批判。"},{"instruction":"请将“こうした展開はなんら成果のないままだったわけではなかった。価値の形態（ブルジョア社会の細胞形態）から資本主義の解剖ないし運動法則，あるいはその歴史的克服の必然性を導出するというマルクスのプログラムが，急速な資本蓄積という新局面に直面してもはや履行されえないようにみえた場合，経済学批判を新たな「事実」に照らしてあらためて解釈することは自然の道理だった。たとえば，ハバーマスはつぎのような見解を主張している。経済への国家の介入および，そのことによる国家という上部構造に対する経済主体の自立性の瓦壊によって，経済学批判から社会の総体的批判を展開することが不可能になった，と。彼によれば「テクノクラート的正当化」が階級社会の正統化に対する等価交換のイデオロギーの役割をひきうけている。それゆえ，「テクノクラ一ト的意識」批判が，経済学批判にかわって資本主義の正当化の土台を掘りくずすといわねばならない,ということになる。 マルクス主義経済学者あるいは，たびたび称せられるように，「ネオ·マルクス主義」経済学者にとって，否定しがたい資本蓄積の実際の成功はおのずから大きな理論問題をもたらした。にもかかわらず，現在の資本の発展形態を経済学批判のカテゴリーからあえて導出しようと試みる者はほとんどいない。この数少ない人々のなかでもっとも有名なのは-少なくとも60年代半ばにいたるまで-，『マルクス主義経済理論』を著したエルネスト·マンデルである。 彼はまず，弁護的関心を追求し，マルクスの理論は依然として正しいということをぜひとも証明するのだという労苦の多い試みを企てた。国家介入が蓄積法則から導出させられる点にまで経済学批判の諸カテゴリーの展開をおしすすめていくかわりに，マンデルは，考えられるすべての諸理論のうちでマルクスの理論が依然として最良であるということを証明するはずの諸事実の巨大な一件書類を作成することに，彼のすぐれた能力を消耗した。あらゆる学問分野において，そして全歴史過程においてマルクスの枠組の優位性を示す証拠がちりばめられているので，マンデルは800頁も使って全学問領域と，ティコピア島民からはじめてコンピューター時代にいたるまでの全歴史にかかわらねばならなかった。その成果に若干の功績があることは否定されえなかった。とくに彼の著書は，マルクスの理論をあらたな現実に適合させ，戦後の資本展開の批判に適用しようとした数少ない試みのひとつであった。けれども，圧倒的に経験的方法に基因する欠点から免れてはいなかった。彼が現代資本主義の叙述に深入りすればするほど，素材の叙述的処理が一層強く前面に出たのであった。 経済学批判の再構築における理論的困難のために，かなり独特なもうひとつの道をえらんだのは二人のアメリカの経済学者，バランとスウィージーである。むかしの彼らの著作の過少消費理論的出発，すなわち，資本主義は自らに固有の消費限界性によって，生産された商品を捌ききれず，したがって恒常的に過剰生産傾向を生ぜしめるというテーゼは，その重要な理論的帰結といえなくもないのだが，彼らの後の著作『独占資本』での周知のケインズ主義的諸テーゼをもたらした。こうした展開は「ケインズ左派」（J.ロビンソン，A.ハンセン，M.カレツキ，J.シュタインドル）への接近，有効需要の理論への接近，そして価値論と蓄積論をはずして単に資本主義の政治構造のマルクス主義的分析だけを保持するマルクス解釈への接近を意味した。 フランツ·ペトリーにならってスウィージーは，『資本主義発展の理論』のなかで価値論の質的側面と量的側面を区別していた。質的側面について彼は次のように述べていた。「商品物神性の理論という帰結をともなう質的価値理論は，マルクスの資本主義分析における本質的方法である。これを理解していないひとは，マルクスの批判的方法についてほとんど理解していないのである」。量的側面についてスウィージーは，価値理論から（ボルトキエーヴィチの改良作業によって）生産価格が導出されうるという見解を述べた。独占価格はこの理論のちょっとした変更を必要とするであろうが，結局のところ，こうした変更は価値法則の根本的原理をくつがえすことはできないであろう，と。 ところが，『独占資本』においてバランとスウィージーがとった立場は，これとは別のものであった。すなわち，マルクスの理論は，19世紀イギリスにあてはまる競争モデルに基づいているので，価値理論と剰余価値概念は今日その理論的妥当性を失っており，別の概念，たとえば余剰〔Surplus］とか独占価格といったものに替えられねばならない，とする。これによってケインズ左派への接近は完成した。なぜなら，ケインズ左派はマルクスに対して，その価値理論にもかかわらずーケインズ左派の人々の目には，それは経済学史にというよりもより形而上学史にふさわしいマルクスの気まぐれ以外の何ものでもないと映るのである-，ほとんど完全に大きな功績を認めてきたからである。バランとスウィージーが価値理論を拒否するさい，たとえケインズ左派とは理由を異にするとはいえ（後者にあっては全否定，前者においては競争資本主義の時代への限定），両者は同じ結論になる。マルクスにおける「古くさく」なったものを除去したあとに残るものはといえば，アクチュアルな諸側面，とくに不足する有効需要として定式化される過少消費理論である。”翻译为中文","output":"这样的发展并非毫无成果。面对快速的资本积累这一新阶段时，看似无法再执行马克思从价值形式（资本主义社会的细胞形态）推导出资本主义的解剖或运动法则，或其历史性克服的必要性的计划，因此重新解释经济学批判以适应新的“事实”变得自然而然。例如，哈贝马斯主张的观点是，国家对经济的干预以及由此导致的经济主体对于国家这一上层建筑的自主性崩溃，使得从经济学批判到社会的总体批判变得不可能。他认为，“技术官僚的合理化”承担了阶级社会正当化等价交换意识形态的角色。因此，必须通过“技术官僚意识”批判来代替经济学批判，以此挖掘资本主义合理化的基础。 对马克思主义经济学家或经常被称为“新马克思主义”经济学家而言，无可否认的资本积累的实际成功带来了重大的理论问题。尽管如此，几乎没有人敢于尝试从经济学批判的范畴中直接推导出当前资本发展的形态。在这少数人中，最著名的——至少直到60年代中期——是撰写了《马克思主义经济理论》的恩斯特·曼德尔。 他首先追求辩护性的目的，费尽心力试图证明马克思的理论仍然正确。曼德尔不是推动经济学批判的范畴发展到可以从积累规律中得出国家干预，而是耗费了他卓越能力来创建一个庞大的文件，旨在证明在所有可能的理论中，马克思的理论仍然是最佳的。为了展示马克思框架的优越性，曼德尔必须涉猎所有学科领域，以及整个历史过程，从提科皮岛居民到计算机时代，他用了800页时间来完成这一切。他的成果有着不可否认的成就，尤其是作为一次为使马克思的理论适应新现实并应用于战后资本发展批评的少数尝试之一。然而，它免不了被压倒性的经验方法的缺陷所困扰。他越是深入现代资本主义的叙述，就越是表现出物质的描述性处理。 由于在经济学批判的重构中遇到的理论困难，选择了一条相当独特道路的是两位美国经济学家，巴兰和斯威齐。他们早期著作中的过少消费理论起点，即资本主义由于其固有的消费限制性，无法消化生产出的商品，因而持续导致过剩生产倾向的论断，尽管可以说是他们重要的理论成果之一，但在后来的著作《垄断资本》中引出了众所周知的凯恩斯主义论断。这样的发展意味着接近“凯恩斯左翼”（J.罗宾逊，A.汉森，M.卡莱茨基，J.施泰因德尔），接近有效需求理论，以及接近一种除去价值理论和积累理论，仅保持对资本主义政治结构的马克思主义分析的马克思解释。 跟随弗兰茨·彼得里，斯威齐在《资本主义发展的理论》中区分了价值理论的质量面和量化面。对于质性方面，他说：“引出商品物神性理论的质性价值理论是马克思资本主义分析中的本质方法。那些不理解这一点的人，几乎不了解马克思的批判方法。”对于量化方面，斯威齐提出了从价值理论中（通过博尔特基维奇的改进工作）可以推导生产价格的观点。垄断价格可能需要对这一理论进行一些调整，但最终，这些变化不太可能颠覆价值规律的基本原则。 然而，在《垄断资本》中，巴兰和斯威齐采取了不同的立场。即，马克思的理论基于19世纪英国的竞争模型，因此价值理论和剩余价值概念已失去其理论有效性，必须被其他概念所取代，比如剩余和垄断价格等。这完成了与凯恩斯左翼的接近。因为凯恩斯左翼尽管认同马克思价值论的重要性——在他们看来，它更像是经济史而非形而上学史中的马克思的奇思妙想——他们几乎完全承认了马克思的巨大成就。当巴兰和斯威齐拒绝价值理论时，尽管出于不同的原因（后者是完全否定，前者是限于竞争资本主义时代），两者都得出了相同的结论。在扣除了马克思中“过时”的内容之后，所剩下的就是实际的各个方面，特别是作为过少消费理论所形式化的有效需求不足。"},{"instruction":"请将“バランとスウィージーにしてみれば，資本は国家支出によって過少消費恐慌から救われるので，ケインズ主義は彼らにとって二重の機能を果す。一方で戦後資本主義の経済的諸成果が承認される。しかし他方で，資本主義体制の矛盾についてのマルクス主義的テーゼがあらためて確認される。こういう確認はもちろん，ひとつの新しい定式化のなかでなされるのである。つまり，資本構造における矛盾が，資本から国家と社会との間の矛盾へと移されている。すなわち，彼らのいうところはこうである。なるほど国家の介入によって経済的繁栄の新局面がもたらされはするが，その代償はあまりにも高くつく。依然として存在する不安定性や，失業への潜在的傾向，生産資源の明らかな浪費は別としても社会的富の増加は，それとパラレルに増大する資本主義に固有な破壊的非合理性をもって購われる。軍国主義，人種主義，飢餓によってされる世界における資源の浪費等々。したがって資本主義の否定は，マルクスのように資本それ自体に内在する制約の産物として把握されるべきではなく，非合理性に対する合理性の抽象的な反対として，経済的成果に反対する人間的欲求のそれとして把握されるべきである。こうした物質的矛盾の道徳的矛盾による置換は，ひとつの新たな革命主体の同定化をもたらした。それは第三世界，青年，黒人である。だから，バランとスウィージーがマルクーゼとともに，学生運動によってもっともすっきり受けいれられた理論家であったことは偶然ではない。 バランとスウィージーないしはマンデルが代表していた折衷主義，教条主義の立場にもかかわらず，これらの著者たちには少なからぬ意義が付与される。というのは，彼らは第二次大戦後の資本主義の発展をマルクス主義の基礎に立って解釈しようとした数少ない人々だからである。この発展傾向がバランースウィージーにあってはブルジョア経済学の概念でとらえられ，マンデルにおいては単に叙述的にとりあげられただけだったという事実は，彼らの理論の枠を規定しているいまひとつの連関を示唆している。それは，労働運動の客観的な危機状況であり，あらたな一見長続きする資本蓄積の局面の政治的諸結果である。 経済学批判とその諸カテゴリーが，たとえば国家独占資本主義の理論におけるように公式に適用された場合，マルクスへの関係はレーニンあるいは第三インタナショナルの論議を通してフィルターをかけられた。ポール·ボッカラの場合，資本過剰というマルクス主義的問題設定の再採用から導かれた諸結論は，当然のことながら反独占-民主化闘争をめざす語法へ定式化されたとはいえ，バラン-スウィージーのケインズ主義からそれほど隔ったものではない。バランースウィージーと同様に，ボッカラは，国家介入が資本主義の発展における新たな一段階をなし，この段階は国家によって保証された独占利潤の存在によって規定されると考える。けれども，ボッカラはバランースウィージーとちがい，このような保証は有効需要の拡大によるよりも，生産への公的融資と固定資本の一部の国家による減価によって果されると考えている。社会資本の一部を国家がひき受けること，および採算を度外視してそれを充用することによって，ボッカラの理論においては資本減価と比肩しうる諸作用が生じる。すなわち，資本の一部はもはや総剰余価値のそれに相応する部分を請求しようとはせず，価値増殖から排除され，そのことによって私的形態にある残りの資本部分の収益性を改善するのである。ボッカラによれば，国家と独占との間の同盟が，課税とインフレーションによってプロレタリアートのほかに他の諸セクター（中間階級，賃金生活者一般，非独占産業）にもふりかかる第二次搾取に社会を服させるので，社会は一方に独占的寡頭制，他方に住民大多数へと分極化する。バオルタナテイヴランースウィージーと同様にボッカラも，社会主義諸国の例は代替像の意識化に寄与しうると考えている。ボッカラにとって国家とは，その体内に貫通している社会化諸契機に基づいて社会主義を客観的に準備するものなので，社会主義への道をきりひらくためには国家介入は根本において，もっぱら民主主義的-反独占的コントロールのもとにおかれなければならないのである。 60年代後半になってふたたび蓄積の困難性があらわれ，ケインズ主義的経済政策の限界があきらかになるにつれて，「有効需要」の拡大によって失業を防止するという国家の可能性が，現実の経済の展開によって疑われるようになった。一方の失業，他方の軽いインフレ率をともなう完全雇用との間のケインズ的二者択一は，もはや有効とは思われない。つまり，ブルジョア経済学者自身によって「スタグフレーション」という用語で表現されているインフレと失業の同時存在がいまや，持続する資本主義の繁栄という50年代の見通しを消滅させるのである。 新たな恐慌の徴候はもちろん当面は限定されている。そして，ケインズ主義の危機が現実化するか，あるいは新たな，ひょっとしたら長期の好況運動がいま一度ケインズ主義の危機を潜在化させるか，これはまだ完全には見通せない。しかし，今日，いずれにせよ資本主義は恐慌の襲来を克服できるといったテーゼに，さらなる理論的探究なしに明らかに自明のこととして固執することはできないのである。それはあるいは50年代には可能だったのかもしれないが。安定期の終焉とともに，とくに階級間諸闘争がわきあがり，尖鋭化してきた-これは新たに展開する危機の潜在力の徴候である。こうした状況において経済学批判の再構成に対する関心は，それを展開させるなかで，もちろんなお取り戻さるべき信憑性を獲得するように思われるのである。 IIヶインズ批判と国家支出の機能。「不再生産」財生産部門の意味 ケインズの理論構造と，ケインズによって方向づけられた諸命題を以下論ずるさいに追求されるべきは，消費の，とくに国家による消費の蓄積に及ぼす作用を解明することである。以下の分析では，国家の活動はつねに流通局面に関係づけられ，生産諸条件自体のありうべき変更には関係しない。剩余価値生産を目的とする国家の活動というものは，合理化され集中された資本それ自体の諸機能以外の何ものでもないし，そういうことは蓄積理論の枠内でのみ扱われるのがふさわしいといえるからである。したがって，ケインズ主義的国家としての国家は，以下の行論では所得と剰余価値流通への国家支出の及ぼす働きの面であとづけられる。”翻译为中文","output":"对于巴兰和斯威齐而言，由于资本通过国家支出被从过少消费的恐慌中拯救，因此凯恩斯主义对他们而言具有双重功能。一方面，战后资本主义的经济成就得到承认。但另一方面，马克思主义关于资本主义体系矛盾的论断得到了重新确认。这种确认当然是在新的表述中进行的。即，资本结构中的矛盾被转移到了资本与国家及社会之间的矛盾中。换句话说，他们的观点是：虽然国家的干预带来了经济繁荣的新阶段，但代价却过于高昂。尽管社会财富的增加，除了仍然存在的不稳定性、失业的潜在趋势和生产资源的明显浪费，还必须用资本主义固有的破坏性非理性来购买，比如军国主义、种族主义和饥饿导致的世界资源的浪费等。因此，对资本主义的否定不应被视为马克思所说的资本本身内在限制的产物，而应该作为对非理性的抽象反对，作为人类需求反对经济成果的。 这种物质矛盾向道德矛盾的替换带来了新的革命主体的识别，即第三世界、青年和黑人。因此，巴兰和斯威齐与马尔库塞一起成为学生运动最完美接受的理论家并非偶然。 尽管巴兰和斯威齐或曼德尔代表了折衷主义、教条主义的立场，但这些作者仍被赋予了相当的意义。因为他们是少数试图基于马克思主义的基础来解释第二次世界大战后资本主义的发展的人。这种发展趋势在巴兰斯威齐那里被视为资产阶级经济学概念，在曼德尔那里则仅仅是叙述性地被提及，这一事实暗示了另一个他们理论框架界定的相关性，那就是劳动运动的客观危机状态，以及新的似乎持久的资本积累阶段的政治结果。 当经济学批判及其各个范畴，例如在国家垄断资本主义理论中被正式应用时，与马克思的关系被通过列宁或第三国际的讨论过滤。在保罗·博卡拉的情况下，从马克思主义问题设定的再采用中得出的结论，自然而然地被制定为反垄断-民主化斗争的话语，尽管如此，与巴兰-斯威齐的凯恩斯主义关系不是那么远。和巴兰斯威齐一样，博卡拉认为国家干预构成了资本主义发展中的一个新阶段，这一阶段由国家保障的垄断利润的存在来定义。然而，博卡拉与巴兰斯威齐不同，他认为这种保障不是通过扩大有效需求来实现，而是通过向生产提供公共贷款和国家对固定资本部分的折旧。国家承担社会资本的一部分，并忽视成本地使用它，在博卡拉的理论中产生了与资本折旧相匹敌的效应。即，资本的一部分不再要求其相应的总剩余价值部分，被排除在价值增殖之外，从而改善了私人形式下剩余资本部分的盈利性。博卡拉认为，由于国家与垄断之间的联盟，通过税收和通货膨胀，社会被迫接受第二次剥削，不仅针对无产阶级，而且针对其他各个领域（中间阶级、一般工资生活者、非垄断产业），使社会两极分化为独占寡头制和民众大多数。正如巴兰斯威齐一样，博卡拉也认为社会主义国家的例子可以帮助意识到替代方案。对博卡拉而言，国家是基于其内在的社会化机制客观地准备社会主义的，因此为了开辟通往社会主义的道路，国家干预本质上必须置于民主-反垄断控制之下。 到了60年代后半叶，当积累的困难性再次显现，凯恩斯主义经济政策的局限性变得明显时，“通过扩大有效需求防止失业”的国家可能性受到了实际经济发展的质疑。凯恩斯主义的这种二选一——一方面是失业，另一方面是伴随着轻微通胀率的全面就业——不再被视为有效。即所谓“滞胀”的现象，即通货膨胀和失业的同时存在，现在已经消除了50年代对资本主义持续繁荣的预期。 新的恐慌迹象当然目前是有限的。凯恩斯主义的危机是否会实现，或者是否会有新的、可能是长期的繁荣周期再次使凯恩斯主义的危机潜伏，这还不完全清楚。但是，今天，无论如何，无法在没有进一步的理论探索的情况下明确自明地坚持资本主义可以克服恐慌侵袭的论断。也许在50年代是可能的。随着稳定时期的结束，特别是随着阶级间的斗争高涨和尖锐化——这是新兴危机潜力的迹象——对经济学批判的重构的兴趣似乎应该在其展开中重新获得信誉。"},{"instruction":"请将“IIヶインズ批判と国家支出の機能。「不再生産」財生産部門の意味 ケインズの理論構造と，ケインズによって方向づけられた諸命題を以下論ずるさいに追求されるべきは，消費の，とくに国家による消費の蓄積に及ぼす作用を解明することである。以下の分析では，国家の活動はつねに流通局面に関係づけられ，生産諸条件自体のありうべき変更には関係しない。剩余価値生産を目的とする国家の活動というものは，合理化され集中された資本それ自体の諸機能以外の何ものでもないし，そういうことは蓄積理論の枠内でのみ扱われるのがふさわしいといえるからである。したがって，ケインズ主義的国家としての国家は，以下の行論では所得と剰余価値流通への国家支出の及ぼす働きの面であとづけられる。 ケインズによれば，国民所得の両部分-消費と貯蓄-は経済発展の過程でつりあって増大するわけではない。消費は国民所得より相対的に緩慢に増加する。それゆえ，総消費は絶対的には伸びるにもかかわらず，国民所得に対してつねに減少する。一方，貯蓄率は国民所得のそれよりも速く成長する。したがって貯蓄は国民所得のうち，つねに増大する部分を形成する。そのことによって，この相対的に増大する貯蓄額はどのように割りふられうるかという問題が生じる。それが投資にまわされれば，全所得はそれに応じて増大する。投資にあてられなければ，投資がおこなわれなかったために減少する。けれども，ケインズの構図で重要なのはこのことではない。実際に彼の功績の大きいのは，投資可能性の縮小傾向を理論的に把握し，その点に後期資本主義の問題を認識してきたことにある。そのさい，彼はひとつの解決を国家による刺激活動や，そればかりか部分的には投資のコントロールのうちに求めた。すなわち投資は，国家の支えがなければ資本収益性の減少のために低落する傾向をもつようになる，とケインズは考えた。その理由をケインズはつぎのように述べる。「もしある期間内に所与の種類の資本において投資が増加するならば，その種の資本の限界効率はそれへの投資が増加するにつれて低下する，（······）なぜならば予想収益は，その種の資本の増加によって減少するようになるからである（······）」。そこで，「資本価値がその存続期間中にもともとの供給価格よりも大きな総価値を生み出すという見通しを提供する唯一の理由は，それが稀少である」からなので，資本の収益性を規定するのは，資本の稀少度なのである。 資本稀少がなくなれば，それゆえ長期的には資本の収益性は減少する。資本がより稀少であるとか，稀少でないとかいうことが何を意味するかについて，もちろんこのケインズ主義的立論は説明していない。どの点に関して資本不足あるいは資本過剰が想定されるのか？これはただ利潤に関してであることは明らかであって，きっと欲求充足に関してのことではない。資本がもはや稀少ではないという場合，意味するところは，ある特定の利潤量にとって資本が大きすぎる，あるいは，ある特定の資本にとって利潤が小さすぎるということである。したがってケインズは堂堂めぐりをし，利潤減少を資本過剰で説明し，結局のところ利潤減少それ自体で説明することになる。 それにもかかわらず，ケインズは問題を正しく設定し，国民所得の変動はなによりも資本需要の視点から理解できるようになるのであり，消費財への需要という視点からではないということを把握していた。所得が消費と貯蓄から構成されるとすれば，経済的循環における変調は消費の側面から考えられえないのであって，貯蓄を投資にむけることの困難性から，つまり資本の側面から考えられるべきなのである。 したがって，ケインズの理論を過少消費の理論として新たに解釈するならば，ケインズより一歩も進むことはできない。たとえば，ジョーン·ロビンソンによると，投資率は利潤率に左右され，利潤率は消費財の需要に左右されるということである。消費財の需要はまったく普遍的に賃金水準のうちにその限界を有するので，消費財生産がもはやそれ以上成長しえない一点が存在するといわねばならない。この点に達すると生産手段の需要もまた後退するようになり，その結果，不十分な有効需要に基因する恐慌がおこる，という議論である。しかし，このような立論もまた，なにも説明してはいない。こういう議論は主として，生産領域を消費領域から分離すること，ならびに問題を後者へ転嫁しようとする試みのなかで存在する。実際には資本主義社会において，需要は資本蓄積以外に源泉をもっていない。資本蓄積の外部には需要の源泉は存在しえないのである。このことは当然のことながら，単に生産手段の需要のみならず消費財の需要にもいえることである。というのは，後者は労働力を売ることの結果以外の何ものでもなく，源泉を可変資本の再生産と蓄積のうちにもっているからである。利潤が消費の量によって決まるというのは，資本主義社会にとって逆立ちした議論である。資本主義においては消費は利潤に左右されるのであって，その逆ではない。需要はもっぱら資本拡大によってもたらされうるので，需要は一方で不変資本から，他方では可変資本から生じる。 消費と蓄積の関係あるいは消費財需要と生産手段需要との関係は，それゆえ，有機的構成，すなわち不変資本と可変資本との間の関係によって規定される。有機的構成が高まれば，不変資本の蓄積は消費よりもすみやかに増大するといわねばならない。このことは生産手段を生産する生産部門が消費財生産工業よりも速い成長を実現する場合にのみ可能である。これと反対に有機的構成が低下すれば，消費は不変資本の蓄積より速く成長する。長期的には資本蓄積が有機的構成の増大とともに生ずる，ということを認めるなら，消費の緩慢な上昇は資本蓄積と矛盾しないのみならず，その前提ですらある。 過少消費恐慌というのは，なるほどつねにありうるけれども，資本蓄積にとって外在的であり偶然的である。この恐慌は，有機的構成の上昇にもかかわらず生産手段生産が消費財生産より速く増大しない場合におこる。しかし，これは生産の無政府性のなかでつねに堆積される生産諸部門の発展における不均衡の可能性の個別的ケースであり，けっして必然的な恐慌原因ではない。”翻译为中文","output":"II 凯恩斯批判和国家支出的功能。“非再生产”商品生产部门的含义 探讨凯恩斯的理论结构和凯恩斯指导下的各命题时，应追求的是阐明消费的作用，特别是国家消费对积累的影响。在以下分析中，国家的活动总是与流通阶段联系在一起，与生产条件本身可能的变化无关。国家旨在生产剩余价值的活动，不过是合理化和集中的资本自身功能的延伸，因此只适宜在积累理论的框架内进行讨论。所以，作为凯恩斯主义国家，国家在以下论述中被置后，主要是从国家支出对收入和剩余价值流通产生的影响的角度来看。 凯恩斯认为，国民收入的两部分——消费和储蓄——在经济发展过程中并不是平衡增长的。消费相对于国民收入增长得更慢。因此，尽管总消费绝对增长，但相对于国民收入总是在减少。另一方面，储蓄率增长得比国民收入快。因此，储蓄总是形成国民收入中不断增长的部分。这就引发了如何分配这相对增长的储蓄额的问题。如果这些储蓄被投资，那么总收入将相应增加。如果不被投资，那么由于缺乏投资而减少。然而，重要的不是这一点。凯恩斯的重大成就实际上在于，他理论性地把握了投资可能性的减缩趋势，并在这一点上识别了后资本主义的问题。同时，他寻求解决方案于国家的刺激活动中，甚至部分地在投资控制中。即，投资因没有国家的支持而趋于下降，因为资本的盈利性下降，凯恩斯是这样认为的。凯恩斯这样解释原因：“如果在某一时期内某类资本的投资增加，那么随着对该类资本的投资增加，其边际效率将降低，（......）因为预期收益将随该类资本的增加而减少（......）”。因此，“资本在其存在期间提供的唯一原因是，提供比其最初供应价格更大的总价值，因为它是稀缺的”，所以资本的盈利性是由资本的稀缺性来决定的。 如果没有了资本稀缺，那么长期来看，资本的盈利性将减少。明显的是，这种凯恩斯主义论证并没有解释资本过剩或资本不足的问题设定在哪里？这显然仅与利润有关，而不是与需求满足有关。在资本不再稀缺的情况下，所指的是对某一特定量的利润来说，资本过于充裕，或对某一特定量的资本来说，利润过少。因此，凯恩斯陷入了循环论证，用资本过剩来解释利润减少，最终实际上是用利润减少来解释自身。 尽管如此，凯恩斯正确地提出了问题，并理解到国民收入的变动首先可以从资本需求的角度理解，而不是从消费品需求的角度。如果收入由消费和储蓄构成，那么经济循环中的变调不能从消费的角度考虑，而应该从将储蓄投资的困难，即从资本的角度考虑。 因此，如果将凯恩斯的理论重新解释为过少消费理论，那么将无法比凯恩斯走得更远。例如，乔恩·罗宾逊认为，投资率由利润率决定，利润率由消费品需求决定。消费品需求在本质上总是受到工资水平的限制，因此必须存在消费品生产不能再增长的一个点。达到这一点后，生产手段的需求也会下降，结果是由于有效需求不足而引发的恐慌。然而，这种论证同样没有解释任何东西。这种论点主要存在于将生产领域与消费领域分离，并试图将问题转嫁到后者的尝试中。实际上，在资本主义社会中，需求除了资本积累外没有其他来源。除非资本积累，否则不存在需求的来源。这自然适用于生产手段的需求以及消费品的需求，因为后者不过是出售劳动力的结果，其源泉在于可变资本的再生产和积累。认为利润由消费量决定，对资本主义社会来说是本末倒置的理论。在资本主义下，消费受限于利润，而不是相反。需求仅由资本扩张带来，因此需求一方面来源于不变资本，另一方面来源于可变资本。 消费和积累之间的关系，或消费品需求与生产手段需求之间的关系，因此由有机构成，即不变资本与可变资本之间的关系决定。如果有机构成上升，那么不变资本的积累必须比消费更快增长。这仅在生产手段生产部门比消费品生产工业实现更快增长的情况下才可能。相反，如果有机构成下降，消费将比不变资本的积累增长得更快。如果我们承认，资本积累随着有机构成的增加而发生，那么消费的缓慢上升不仅与资本积累并不矛盾，而且甚至是其前提。 过少消费恐慌确实总是可能发生的，但对资本积累而言是外部的、偶然的。这种恐慌发生在生产手段生产尽管有机构成上升但未能比消费品生产更快增长的情况下。但这仅是生产无政府状态中生产各部门发展不均衡的可能性的个别案例，并不是必然的恐慌原因。"},{"instruction":"请将“需要は資本蓄積の裏面にすぎないという事実からは，つぎのような結論が出てこないことは明らかである。つまり，それは，生産と消費，蓄積と需要が無媒介的に同一のものであり，そのことから，全般的経済恐慌はありえないことが導き出される（セーの法則）というものである。貨幣としての資本 （G） が商品（W）に転化するのは，この転化からより多くの貨幣が生ずる 場合だけであるから，資本が市場で創出する需要はGがG＇に転化可能であるということにかかっているのだということは明らかである。換言すれば，資本に固有の生産を完全に吸収するのに十分な，資本の潜在的需要といったものはっねに存在するのであり，この潜在的需要が現実の需要に転化するかどうかは利潤率に，すなわち，全剰余価値の前貸しされた総資本に対する比率にかかっている。利潤率が下がれば，剰余価値量は全資本の価値増殖を保証するのにもはや十分ではない。この状況下では資本はもはやG-W 転化できなくなる。なぜならば資本の転形の第二局面W-G＇がもはや不可能だからである。資本主義的生産の目的は貨幣から商品への単純転化にあるのでなく剰余価値の抽出に存するから，W-G＇が不可能ならばG-Wはおこらない。この場合，当然需要は減少するが，資本の側で減少するのであり，このことは蓄積過程での停滞の結果であって原因ではないのである。 資本主義的剰余価値生産と消費の間の一般的関係は，一見資本の「外部」に存在する諸要素が考慮に入れられる場合でも変わらない。たとえば，国家需要あるいは非資本主義的経済部門の需要は独立した需要源泉とはみなされえない。なぜならば，国家需要はとりもなおさず爾余の経済活動から何らかの方法でとり出された経済資源の動員以外の何ものでもないからであり，それゆえ，私的なものから公的な手に移った蓄積された価値量にほかならないからである。これと同様に非資本主義的部門の需要は，いかなる場合でも資本によって生ずる需要に加算されるべき別の追加需要の一種とはみなされえない。なぜならば，この追加需要は非資本主義的部門からの商品に対する資本の需要によって均衡化されるからである。この推論は当然，なによりもまず国家需要にとって重要である。ここでもまた，すでに述べた分析が妥当性をもつ。すなわち，あらゆる種類の需要は，したがって国家需要もまた，ただ資本蓄積の裏面にすぎないということである。というのは，以下詳細に論ずるつもりであるが，国家需要は蓄積された剩余価値の一部が私的な手から公的な手のなかへ移されることからのみ生じうるからである。それゆえ，国家需要はさもなくば放置される余剰をもうかる投資にふり向けさせる一種の追加需要をなす，というバランースウィージーのテーゼには同意しがたい。 資本蓄積と需要の発展とを分離させてしまうことに過少消費理論の核心があるのだが，こうした分離化は，過少消費理論がさまざまな歴史的現象においてつねに随伴してきた第二のテーゼを内包している。消費財の需要と比して生産が過剰になることのうちに不況への傾向の根拠が存在するとすれば，所得，したがって需要をもたらす資源を，それに見合った消費財を形成することなしにすべて使ってしまえば，失われた均衡を再建する傾向が生じるのは明らかである。 たとえば，ある機械の生産は所得を生みだす。けれども生産手段としてその機械は新たな消費財の創出にも寄与する。これと反対に，奢侈品生産あるいは軍需生産は，何らかの方法で新たな消費財の生産に寄与するということもなく，ただ所得だけを生みだすのである。したがって，不生産的労働の安定化機能というテーゼは，過少消費理論と密接にむすびついているひとつのテーゼを奏でる。不生産的労働と不生産的消費の理論は当然のことながら，資本主義発展の過程でさまざまな機能と意義をおびる。マルサスにとっては，過少消費テーゼが奢侈品生産の「社会的」機能の正当化と土地貴族による不生産的消費の正当化に奉仕した。ケインズ主義的形態のあらたな過少消費理論は不生産的労働を国家が充用することをイデオロギー的に正当化しようとするものである。バランースウィージーのひそみにならえば，不生産的労働はたとえ非合理的，破壊的浪費の増大という代価を払ってであれ，増大する「余剰」にとって追加販路を生ぜしめる機能を，それゆえ，経済状況を安定させる機能をもつのである。 過少消費テーゼの息のかかったすべての理論においては生産と消費の関係が転倒しているということに照応しているのが，生産的労働と不生産的労働の関係の逆転である。これまでみてきたように，過少消費理論においては利潤の水準は消費水準に左右されるとされた。このような方法では，労働生産性（資本主義社会では利潤生産を意味する）は十分な量の不生産的労働が利潤を実現するという事実に依拠することになる。それによれば不生産的労働は利潤生産としての労働生産性の前提条件であるかのようにみえる。ここでもことは逆立ちしている。というのは，利潤量に，それと矛盾しない生産的労働量が依拠するのであって，利潤量が不生産的労働の量的規模に依拠するのではないからである。 以下では，総資本の再生産過程における生産的労働と不生産的労働というカテゴリーの連関を簡潔に素描することを試みよう。そのさいに示されるのは，直接的生産過程レヴェルで与えられている生産的-不生産的労働規定は若干の修正を必要とするということである。そうすることによって生産的労働-不生産的労働が総資本の価値増殖に及ぼす作用を究明しうるであろう。したがって，叙述は連続するふたつの手続を踏んでなされる。1．直接的生産過程における生産的労働と不生産的労働，2．総資本の再生産過程における生産的労働と不生産的労働。”翻译为中文","output":"由于需求仅仅是资本积累的另一面，因此明显不能得出以下结论，即生产与消费、积累与需求是无中介地同一的，并由此得出全面经济恐慌不存在的结论（赛伊定律）。资本作为货币（G）转化为商品（W）仅在这种转化能产生更多的货币时发生，因此资本在市场上创造的需求取决于G能否转化为G'。换言之，存在着资本的潜在需求，足以完全吸收资本固有的生产，潜在需求是否转化为实际需求取决于利润率，即预付总资本对总剩余价值的比率。如果利润率下降，剩余价值量将不再足以保证资本的价值增长。在这种情况下，资本将不再能进行G-W转化。因为如果W-G'的第二阶段变得不可能，资本主义生产的目的不在于货币到商品的简单转化，而在于剩余价值的提取，那么G-W就不会发生。在这种情况下，需求会减少，但是从资本方面减少，这是积累过程中停滞的结果，而非原因。 资本主义剩余价值生产与消费之间的一般关系即使考虑到看似存在于资本“外部”的因素时也不会改变。例如，国家需求或非资本主义经济部门的需求不能被视为独立的需求来源。因为国家需求归根到底不过是以某种方式从其他经济活动中抽取的经济资源的动员，因此仅仅是从私人手中转移到公共手中的积累价值量。同样，非资本主义部门的需求在任何情况下都不能被视为应加到由资本产生的需求上的另一种附加需求。因为这种附加需求会被资本对非资本主义部门商品的需求所抵消。这种推理对于国家需求尤其重要。这里同样适用已经提到的分析，即所有类型的需求，因此国家需求也仅仅是资本积累的反面。因为，如下所述，国家需求仅源自积累的剩余价值的一部分从私人手中转移到公共手中。因此，难以同意巴兰和斯威齐的论点，即国家需求构成一种附加需求，将原本可能被忽视的盈余投资转向有利投资。 过少消费理论的核心在于将资本积累与需求的发展分离开来，这种分离包含了过少消费理论一直伴随各种历史现象的第二个论点。如果生产相对于消费品需求过剩是导向萧条的根本原因，那么消耗掉产生收入、因而产生需求的资源而不形成相应的消费品，就显然会产生重建失去的平衡的趋势。 例如，生产一台机器产生了收入。但作为生产手段，这台机器也有助于创造新的消费品。相反，奢侈品生产或军需生产只产生收入，而不以任何方式帮助生产新的消费品。因此，非生产性劳动的稳定化功能是与过少消费理论紧密相连的论点之一。非生产性劳动和非生产性消费的理论在资本主义发展过程中具有各种功能和含义。对马尔萨斯而言，过少消费论点为奢侈品生产的“社会”功能和地主阶级通过非生产性消费的正当化服务。新的凯恩斯主义形式的过少消费理论试图为国家充当非生产性劳动的意识形态正当化。按照巴兰和斯威齐的说法，非生产性劳动，即使以增长的非理性、破坏性浪费为代价，也能为增长的“盈余”创造附加销售渠道，从而具有稳定经济状况的功能。 所有受过少消费论影响的理论都呈现出生产与消费关系的逆转，以及生产性劳动与非生产性劳动关系的逆转。如同我们所见，在过少消费理论中，利润水平被认为受到消费水平的影响。用这种方式，劳动生产率（在资本主义社会意味着利润生产）依赖于非生产性劳动实现利润的事实。据此看来，非生产性劳动似乎是作为利润生产即劳动生产率的前提条件。这里又一次颠倒了顺序。利润量依赖于与之不矛盾的生产性劳动量，而不是利润量依赖于非生产性劳动的数量规模。 以下将尝试简要概述生产性劳动和非生产性劳动在总资本的再生产过程中的关系。将展示的是，生产性与非生产性劳动的定义需要一些修正，这是在直接生产过程中给出的。这样做可以探究生产性劳动-非生产性劳动对总资本价值增殖的影响。因此，叙述将遵循两个步骤：1. 直接生产过程中的生产性劳动与非生产性劳动；2. 总资本的再生产过程中的生产性劳动与非生产性劳动。"},{"instruction":"请将“マルクスは労働過程視点での生産的労働と価値増殖過程視点での生産的労働とを区別している。すなわち，労働過程においては生産の目的に相応して，対象の変化をもたらす労働は生産的労働としてあらわれる。使用価値のうちに人間労働の主体的活動が対象化される。それゆえ生産的労働とは，使用価値の生産において生産計画に照応して対象化される労働である。こうした生産的労働トレーガー規定は当然ずっと存続しつづけるし，使用価値のみが価値の担い手たりうるので，この規定は資本主義的生産の視角からも必要である。しかし，それでは不十分なのである。というのは，資本主義的生産の目的は使用価値の生産ではなく，資本の価値増殖なのだからである。したがって資本主義的視点からみれば，剰余価値を生みだす労働のみが生産的なものとみなされるのである。それゆえ，資本主義社会における労働生産性は賃労働としての労働に帰せられる規定である。したがって資本主義的生産性というのは，生産諸関係の表現であって，人間の自然に対する関係の表現ではない。だから，生産性はただ単に具体的労働を指すのみならず，抽象的労働をも指すものであり，つぎのような事実をも示すのである。すなわち，労働は資本にとって使用価値なのであり，しかもそれは，資本が生産過程の主体的な生きた要素として買う商品，つまり労働力の使用価値であるという事実をも示す。労働生産性は資本にとっての労働力商品の使用価値の資本家的表現である。このことは，労働力商品の充用によって生産されうる価値よりも労働力商品は小さな価値しかもっていないことを表現している。 人間労働の資本主義的生産性は賃労働-資本関係においてのみ表現される。この関係において労働者は自らの豊富な潜勢的な生きた労働を死んだ蓄積された労働と交換する。この蓄積された労働が資本として機能するということ，すなわち，それは賃労働との交換関係のなかで，剰余価値の抽出によって自己増殖すべくあらわれるということ，これが本質的なのである。それゆえ生産的労働は資本に対する関係における賃労働のことであって，単に資本所有者に対する関係における賃労働ではない。資本家の所得は，実際にはあるサーヴィスとの交換における収入としても支払われうる。こうした場合にも資本家の所得は賃労働との交換関係へふみ込む。しかし，この場合自らの価値のうちに剰余価値を含み市場で売られるようないかなる商品も，当該賃労働によって生産されない。この賃労働は資本家のための消費財を生産するだけであるか，あるいはサーヴィスを提供するだけであり，したがって，資本家によって支払われる所得分はこの場合には，剩余価値を賃労働からひき出す資本として価値増殖をおこなうことがないのである。それゆえ，この場合に資本取得が関係する労働は資本主義的立場からは生産的労働とみなされない。 生産的労働と不生産的労働との区分は，ここでの叙述レヴェルでは生産物の使用価値と何の関係もないし，労働の具体的諸特徴とも何の関係もない。生産的労働と不生産的労働とは労働の社会的規定なのであり，労働が資本として所得と関係するのか，収 入として所得と関係するのかに照応したものである。同一の労働類型-マルクスは例としてピアノ生産をあげている-が生産的労働でも不生産的労働でもありうるのであり，その違いは労働力の売却，すなわち，労働者が利潤をともなって市場で売られる商品を生産するのか，あるいは，彼の労働が資本家の所得の一部で，または他の所得保有者の所得の一部で生産物総価値のうちに一定の剰余価値量を含まずに支払われるのか，に応じて生ずるのである。後者の場合には，消費局面に入る前に貨幣-資本にかえられる必要のある商品-資本を労働が生みだすのではなく，直接買い手の所得のー部との交換で消費局面に入るのである。 しかしながら，経済学批判の諸カテゴリーの展開にさいして明らかなのは，これまで展開してきた生産的労働規定も総資本レヴェルにとっては不十分だということである。われわれがいままで考察してきた剩余価値生産は個別資本にとっての剩余価値生産であった。しかし個別資本の価値増殖はそのまま総資本の価値増殖ではない。総資本の価値増殖は総体的な追加諸条件に従うのであり，その諸条件を，少なくとも大きな特徴のうちに再構築しなければならない。したがって，総資本レヴェルでの生産的労働概念は，個別資本レヴェルでの生産的労働概念の部分修正から展開されねばならない。 資本の生産物は商品である。この商品は市場において特定の貨幣量の形で自らの価値を実現する。この貨幣額のうちに商品の総価値のすべての構成要素-それゆえ，ただ単に生産費用だけでなく，そのなかに含まれる剰余価値も-が実現される。つねに自己拡大する価値としての資本は，貨幣形態に結晶化されるわけにはいかない。資本は自己の価値増殖の源泉として生きた労働をのみつくさなければならない。資本はつねに，貨幣形態から商品形態に再転化されねばならないし，市場で，ただ労働力需要のみならず生産手段需要としてふたたび姿をあらわさなければならない。商品＝資本の形態から貨幣を経て生産資本の形態（生産手段と労働力）へいたる途上での絶えざる変態は，結局，商品の構造のうちにすでに包摂されている使用価値と交換価値との間の矛盾の，資本レヴェルへ移された表現なのである。自己増殖する価値としての資本にとって，その基体，すなわち使用価値はどうでもよいものである。つまり，商品＝資本はその使用価値というヴェールを脱ぎ，貨幣＝資本に転化する。すなわち，一般的等価物の抽象形態に転化する。これと反対に生産的資本にとって，使用価値はどうでもよいものだというわけではない。というのは，この場合に重要なのは，まさに労働力や生産手段という使用価値だからである。すなわち労働力の使用価値は，それが労働であるという意味，すなわち価値の生産であるという意味においてであり，生産手段の使用価値は，生産手段が労働の支出を可能にするからである。それゆえ，資本は商品の構造における使用価値と価値との内部矛盾によって，貨幣形態から生産的形態に，生産的形態から商品形態に，そしてあらためて貨幣形態，生産的形態等々への恒常的な転換過程へとすすまざるをえないのである。このことが意味するところはつぎのことである。資本は二重化を生みださねばならない。商品形態から貨幣形態をへて生産的形態へと転移するためには，その資本の生産的形態に適合する商品形態をとっている別の資本が現に存在していることが必要であり，他方，前者の商品形態は第二の資本の生産的形態に相応していることが必要なのである。ところで，あらゆる資本の生産的形態は少なくとも二つの商品-労働力と生産手段-から成っているので，資本概念は，少なくとも二つの資本の媒介，すなわち，消費財を生産する資本と生産手段を生産する資本の媒介を必要とする。まったく一般的にいって，労働力も生産手段も多数の商品から成っているので，資本概念は「多数の資本」によって媒介されねばならないのである。 ”翻译为中文","output":"马克思区分了劳动过程中的生产性劳动和价值增殖过程中的生产性劳动。也就是说，在劳动过程中，根据生产目的带来的对象变化的劳动表现为生产性劳动。使用价值中体现了人类劳动的主体性活动。因此，生产性劳动是指在使用价值生产中，根据生产计划体现的劳动。这样的生产性劳动载体定义当然会持续存在，并且由于只有使用价值才能成为价值的载体，这一定义从资本主义生产的视角看也是必要的。然而，这还不够。因为资本主义生产的目的不是生产使用价值，而是资本的价值增殖。因此，从资本主义的视角看，只有产生剩余价值的劳动才被视为生产性的。因此，在资本主义社会中，劳动生产力被归结为作为雇佣劳动的劳动。所以，资本主义的生产力是生产关系的表现，而不是人与自然的关系的表现。因此，生产力不仅仅指具体劳动，也指抽象劳动，并展示了以下事实，即劳动对资本而言是一种使用价值，而且它是资本作为生产过程中的主体性活生生的元素所购买的商品，即劳动力的使用价值。劳动生产力是劳动力商品的使用价值的资本家形式的表现。这表明，劳动力商品所能生产的价值远小于其自身的价值。 人类劳动的资本主义生产力仅在雇佣劳动-资本关系中表现。在这一关系中，工人以其丰富的潜在活生生的劳动交换死的积累劳动。这积累的劳动作为资本发挥作用，即，在与雇佣劳动的交换关系中，通过提取剩余价值而自我增殖，这是本质的。因此，生产性劳动是指与资本的关系中的雇佣劳动，并非仅与资本所有者的关系中的雇佣劳动。资本家的收入实际上也可以通过与某种服务的交换来支付。在这种情况下，资本家的收入也进入了与雇佣劳动的交换关系。然而，在这种情况下，没有任何商品由相关的雇佣劳动生产，而是只生产资本家的消费品或提供服务，因此在这种情况下支付的收入部分不会通过雇佣劳动提取剩余价值，因而不会实现价值增殖作为资本。因此，在这种情况下涉及的劳动不被视为生产性劳动。 生产性劳动与非生产性劳动的区分，在这里的叙述层面与生产物的使用价值没有任何关系，也与劳动的具体特征无关。生产性劳动与非生产性劳动是劳动的社会性规定，是根据劳动是如何与作为资本的收入还是作为收入的收入相关联的。同一类型的劳动——马克思以钢琴制造为例——可以是生产性劳动也可以是非生产性劳动，其差异取决于劳动力的出售，即工人是生产伴随利润在市场上出售的商品，还是他的劳动作为资本家或其他收入所有者的收入的一部分支付，而不包含在产品总价值中的任何特定剩余价值。在后一种情况下，劳动不是生产为要转化为货币-资本的商品-资本，而是直接作为消费阶段中买家收入的一部分交换。 然而，在经济学批判的各个范畴的展开中，显然我们到目前为止考察的生产性劳动的规定对于总资本层面来说是不足的。我们目前考察的剩余价值生产是对于个别资本的剩余价值生产。但是，个别资本的价值增殖并不等同于总资本的价值增殖。总资本的价值增殖遵循整体的附加条件，这些条件必须至少在其主要特征上被重构。因此，总资本层面上的生产性劳动概念必须从对个别资本层面上的生产性劳动概念的部分修正中展开。 资本的产品是商品。这个商品在市场上以特定的货币量形式实现其价值。这个货币量中实现了商品的总价值的所有组成部分——因此不仅仅是生产成本，还包括其中的剩余价值。作为不断自我扩张的价值，资本不能仅仅以货币形式结晶化。资本必须仅仅消耗活生生的劳动作为其价值增殖的源泉。资本必须不断地从货币形式转化回商品形式，并再次以劳动力需求以及生产手段需求在市场上表现。商品=资本形态经由货币到生产资本形态（生产手段和劳动力）的不断变换，最终是商品结构中已经包含的使用价值与交换价值之间矛盾的，转移到资本层面的表达。对自我增殖价值的资本而言，其基体，即使用价值是无关紧要的。也就是说，商品=资本脱去其使用价值的面纱，转化为货币=资本，即转化为一般等价物的抽象形式。相反，对于生产资本来说，使用价值并不是无关紧要的事情，因为重要的是劳动力或生产手段这些使用价值，即劳动力的使用价值在于它是劳动，即是价值的生产，生产手段的使用价值在于它们使劳动的支出成为可能。因此，资本由于商品结构中使用价值与价值的内在矛盾，不得不不断地在货币形态和生产形态之间，再从生产形态转化回商品形态，然后再次转化为货币形态，生产形态等不断的转换过程中前进。这意味着资本必须产生二元化。为了从商品形态转化为货币形态再到生产形态，必须实际存在一个适合于该资本的生产形态的商品形态的另一个资本，而且，前者的商品形态必须适合于后者的生产形态。由于所有资本的生产形态至少由两种商品——劳动力和生产手段组成，因此，资本概念需要至少两个资本的媒介，即生产消费品的资本和生产生产手段的资本的媒介。通常来说，由于劳动力和生产手段都由许多商品组成，所以资本概念必须通过“多个资本”的媒介。"},{"instruction":"请将“こうした媒介をマルクスは再生産表式の分析において研究している。再生産表式を使って示されるのは，総資本はどのように蓄積されうるのか，他方，それの部分部分をなす個別資本は商品一資本から生産的資本への変態をいかに果しうるのか，そのさいいかにして，単に本源的生産的資本を補塡するのみならず，追加的生産的資本も蓄積しうるのか，といった点である。検証は，二つの資本を用いた表式に基づいてなされるが，生産手段を生産する資本はすべて第I部門に，消費財を生産する資本はすべて第II部門に一括されているのである。この分析の結果は二つの資本にとっても妥当するし，各資本が両部門のうちのひとつの内部で，あるいは両部門にまたがって同時に資本の変態を生ぜしめるような多数の資本の一般的場合にも妥当する（この場合の後者は，生産財としても消費財としても用いられうる商品の場合にいえる。たとえば，農業生産の大部分は，一部が消費財として用いられるし，一部はあらたな農業サイクルのための生産財として，あるいはさらなる加工のための生産財として使われる）。 マルクスが『資本論』第二巻で提示した答えはよく知られているので，ここではただ簡潔にその結論をまとめるにとどめたい。 社会的総生産は二部門でおこなわれる。第I部門では生産手段，第II部門では消費手段が生産される。社会的総生産は次の図式であらわされる。 I) II) C1とC2は不変資本をあらわし，それぞれ第I部門，第II部門で作用する。 V1とV2は可変資本をあらわす。すなわち，第I部門，第II部門の労賃である。 cm1とcm2は，第I部門，第II部門において追加的生産手段のために蓄積される資本をあらわす。 vm1とvm2はさらなる生産手段の稼動のために必要な労働者に対する追加的労賃をあらわす。 総資本の変態は生産された商品すべてが市場で販売されることによっておこる。そのさい市場での販売の一部は同一部門内でおこなわれる。たとえば第I 部門の資本によって生みだされた生産手段の一部は，新たに自己の機械廠を設立したり拡大したりする必要のある同一部門内の他の資本によって買われる。この場合，第I部門の商品形態にある資本は，同一部門の他資本の生産的形態に相応するようになる。これらの資本は相互に生産手段をC1＋cm1で等価交換する。総資本のこの部分は第I部門内での変態をひきおこすが，そのさい資本は相互交換によって商品形態から生産的形態に移行する。これに対応したことはV2とvm2で生じる。ここではつぎのような形で変態がおこる。すなわち，第II部門の資本家は労働者に賃金を支払い，その賃金で労働者は第II部門のさまざまな資本家から消費財を買う。売り上げで資本家は新たな労働力を買う。したがって，V2とvm2は商品形態（消費財）から生産的形態（労働力）に転化する。それゆえ，総資本のこの部分もまた市場での交換過程において，第II部門内で商品形態から生産的形態に転化する。 それゆえ，第I部門ではv1とvm1が残り，第II部門にはC2とcm2が残る。資本部分の商品形態から生産的形態への変態は両部門を包摂する市場でおこなわれる。交換は等式 によって表現することができる。この交換で第I部門と第II部門の残りの分の変態がなされる。第I部門の残りの分は商品形態（生産手段）から生産的形態（交換のなかで再び労働力の購入へふりむけられる消費財）へ変わる。それに対応して第II部門の残りの分は商品形態（消費財）から生産的形態（生産手段）へ転化する。したがって，それらの結果，総資本は蓄積のサイクルを一巡する。個別資本はといえば，その資本の商品形態から，生産のサイクルを再びはじめることができる形態へと転化されることによって，同様に蓄積サイクルを一巡する。しかし，そのさい決定的な成果は，総資本の蓄積がすべての個別資本によって生産される剰余価値の総量と同一とされるということである。 アイデンテイテイしかしながらこうした同一 性は，われわれが総資本レヴェルで生ずる新たな生産的労働の諸規定を顧慮するときにはもはや存在しない。これまで上述してきたわれわれの前提はつぎの点であった。1．両部門で給付される労働は，両部門で剰余価値が生産されるから生産的労働である，2．各個別資本の商品形態はひとつあるいは複数の他の個別資本の生産的形態の諸要素に相応する，換言すれば，おのおのの個別資本によって生みだされた商品は例外なく他の資本の生産的資本の諸要素に転化する。 ここから，生産的労働の概念があらたな規定（つまり，剰余価値生産労働としての生産的労働の規定に追加して）を中心に総資本レヴェルで拡大されなければならないということになる。すなわちそれは生産手段であれ生活手段であれ生産的資本の要素に転化する商品を生産する労働は生産的労働であるということになる。 瞥見すればそうではないというものをあげよう。そうすると，資本の商品形態が他の資本の生産的形態の要素に転化されえないというような資本，たとえば奢侈品，武器，インフラストラクチュア財等々があげられるであろう。このような資財の生産は総資本の変態へいかなる作用を及ぼすのか？ このような商品，すなわち奢侈品，武器などの生産に充てられる労働が賃労働であるならば，つまり労働が資本と関係し，市場のために商品を生産するのであれば，この商品は自らの価値の一部に剰余価値を含んでいなければならない。この労働は第一規定によれば生産的労働である。それゆえ，このような商品の生産は c＋v＋mという一般的表式から構成されうる。われわれの再生産表式には二つの部門に第III部門が付け加えられうる。つまり，生産的資本の要素にならないゆえに「不再生産的」とよぶべき商品がこの部門に属する（あるいはまた，これらを奢侈品とよぶこともできる。厳密な意味でいえば，奢侈品はこうした生産のただ一部をなすにすぎないが，軍需生産，インフラストラクチュア財は社会的意味で奢侈品である。なぜならそれは，生産手段の生産にも生活手段の生産にも奉仕しないからである)。 再生産表式はこういう形になる。

OECD에서 정의한 바에 따르면 연구자는 인간, 문화와 사회에 대한 지식을 발전시키고 새로운 응용을 구축하고, 문화와 사회에 대한 지식을 보완하기 위해 체계적으로 수행되는 창의적인 작업인 연구, 리서치를 수행하는 사람으로서 연구는 사실과 이전의 결과를 확인하고 새로운 문제나 기존 문제를 해결하며 어 떤 이론을 뒷받침하거나 새로운 이론을 개발하는 활동을 말합니다. 정리하면 연구는 사실의 확인이나 문제의 해결, 또는 이론의 개발을 모으거나, 이론의 개발을 목적으로 하며 이를 위한 체계적이며 창의적인 활동이라고 할 수 있습니다. 여러분들은 지금 이러한 연구에 첫 발을 내딛고 있는 것입니다. 대학원 생활을 통하여 여러분들은 이 런 연구에 대해서 배우고, 연구자로서 성장하게 될 것입니다. 자, 그럼 좋은 연구자가 되기 위하여 대학원에서 연구는 얻을 수 있을까요? 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까요? 여러분들의 성공적인 대학원 생활을 위한 조언을 말씀드리고자 하니 이 부분 잘 듣고 숙지하여 주시기 바랍니다. 첫 번째, 여러분들의 연구자로서의 생활은 오늘부터, 아니, 여러분들이 대학원에 진학하기로 결심한 순간부터 이미 시작되었습니다. 그냥 학생으로서가 아니라 연구자로서의 자세를 가지고 대학원 생활에 임하기를 권합니다. 굳이 여러분들 대학 시절의 생활과 대학원에서의 생활을 구별하고자 한다면 대학원에서는 여러분들이 처음부터 연구자로서 성장하기 위해서 연구에 대해서 배우고 익히는 부분이 있다는 부분으로 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 두 번째, 여러분들의 지도교수님은 여러분들의 선생님, 강사, 동료, 그리고 어쩌면 인생의 선배로서 매우 중요한 사람입니다. 두 번째, 여러분들의 지도교수님은 여러분들의 선생님, 강사, 동료, 그리고 어쩌면 인생의 선배로서 매우 중요한 사람입니다. 그러므로 교수님과 가능한 자주 만나고 지도교수님이 어떤 사람인지, 특히 교육과 연구에 대해 가지고 있는 지도교수님의 철학을 잘 파악하고 배우도록 하십시오. 마지막으로, 대부분의 교수님들은 열의가 있고 자기두조독인 학생을 좋아합니다. 교수님에게 다음에는 뭐를 할까요? 같은 질문을 하지 마시고, 여러분들의 아이디어나 계획, 설계나 솔루션을 먼저 해 주시기 바랍니다. 감사합니다. 교수님의 생각은 어떠십니까? 하고 물으시기 바랍니다. 교수님들에게는 스스로 고민하고 답을 찾아가려고 노력하는 학생들만큼 사랑스러운 학생은 없다는 사실 잊지 마시기 바랍니다. 교수님들에게는 스스로 고민하고 답을 찾아가려고 노력하는 학생들만큼 사랑스러운 학생은 없다는 사실 잊지 마시기 바랍니다. 또한, 말씀드린 것처럼 다음에는 뭐를 할까요? 라는 얘기를 하신 후에 어떠한 답이 올 때까지 아무 일도 하지 않고 고민 없이 시간을 보내는 학생들이 교수님이 보기에는 좀 편하다고 생각하시면 좋겠습니다. 또한, 말씀드린 것처럼 다음에는 뭐를 할까요? 라는 얘기를 하신 후에 Irrelative ii. 교수님의 비판과 견해를 낮추시기 바랍니다. 좋은 연구자가 되기 위한 대학원에서의 연구에 대해 여섯 가지 제안을 이 페이지에서 소개드리고 싶습니다. 첫 번째, 여러분들의 연구와 논문 작성을 가능한 빨리, 바로 지금 시작하십시오. 내가 아직 부족한데 내가 아직 배운 것이 없으니, 내가 아직 논문 쓸 준비가 되지 않았어, 이런 생각은 들으세요. 이렇게 말하시면 좋겠습니다. 이렇게 말하시면 좋 겠습니다. 지금 현재 알고 있고 현재까지 생각하고 있는 것들도 간단하게라도 논문 형태로 정리해보는 습관이 중요합니다. 둘째, 좋은 연구 문제를 찾아 선택하십시오. 사실 연구와 논문에 있어서 가장 중요한 부분 중에 하나가 연구 문제, 주제에 대한 것이 되겠습니다. 연구의 대상이 되는 연구 문제의 선정은 대단히 중요합니다. 때문에 각 분야에서 중요한 문제를 선택하되 어디서나 새로운 문제를 찾아보도록 하십시오. 또한 각 분야의 현재 문제들과 핫한 인기 주제들을 지속적으로 조사하여 파악하는 것이 매우 중요합니다. 각자 연구 분야의 리뷰 페이퍼에 주의를 기울이시기 바랍니다. 리뷰 페이퍼는 각 분야의 석학들이 해당 연구 분야의 최신 동향이나 연구 분야의 최신 동향이나 연구 분야의 최신 동향을 지적하는 것입니다. 리뷰 페이퍼는 각 분야의 다양한 이론과 이론 등을 종합적으로 분석하고 그동안의 연구 히스토리와 앞으로의 어떤 방향으로 연구를 진행하면 좋을지에 대한 예측과 재현을 담은 논문입니다. 리뷰 페이퍼는 각 분야의 다양한 이론과 기존 연구 사례들을 주제별로 정리하고 있기 때문에 해당 분야를 이해하고 조망하는 데 큰 도움을 줍니다. 때문에 여러분들이 해당된 어떤 특정한 주제나 연구 문제를 결정하시게 되면 해당된 연구 주제에 대한 리뷰 페이퍼 가능하면 가장 최근에 만들어진 리뷰 페이퍼를 찾아서 먼저 읽어보시기를 권해드립니다. 리뷰 페이퍼는 최근의 어떤 동향뿐이 아니라 과거의 히스토리 그러니까 이 주제 에 대해서 예전에는 어떠한 시각으로 어떤 문제들을 찾아서 풀어 나왔는지 또 어떤 연구자들은 어떤 측면의 연구를 진행하였는데 그 관계는 무엇이었는지 또 다른 연구자는 이를 극복하기 위해서 어떠한 노력을 했고 그 결과는 어디까지 진행되었는지 한마디로 현재까지 해당된 주제와 연구 문제에 대한 연구의 진행 상황을 조망할 수 있도록 해주고요. 리뷰 페이퍼 끝부분에는 리뷰 페이퍼를 작성한 연구자의 재현 그러니까 해당된 문제에 대해서 현재까지의 진행된 상황이 이러하니 앞으로는 어떠한 방향이 유망하고고 어떠한 방향의 연구, 어떠한 부분에 대한 노력이 필요하다 같은 것들을 재현하게 됩니다. 그러한 재현이나 정리가 여러분들이 연구 주제에 대해서 이해를 하고 앞으로 어떤 방향으로 아이디어를 펴나가는 것이 좋을지에 대한 결정을 하는데 상당히 큰 도움을 주게 됩니다. 때문에 해당된 분에 대한 리뷰 페이퍼를 먼저 찾아서 읽으시기를 권해드립니다. 자, 세 번째는 효율적인 연구를 위한 가이드라인입니다. 통상 우리가 연구를 할 때 이 문제에 대한 또는 이 주제에 대한 해답, 솔루션이 뭔지에 대 해서 집중해서 생각을 하시는데요. 사실은 해답 솔루션에 대한 생각 전에 이 문제는 도대체 어떤 문제인지 이 문제의 성격은 무엇이고 이 문제가 왜 어렵고 또 어떤 측면에서 바라봐야 되는지 그 문제 자체에 대한 정보를 알아보야 하는 것입니다. 하지만 저희가 수 Professor가 되는 학 WiFi Convertersicio는 lithium 그리고 knots.healR.com activities를 keepshift wayскихuter.com를 굉장히 ?\\"noo.Hey, Try english.jep protocols.html?\\"로 주문하시는 만큼 이렇게 적خ하고 발표할 시간을 어떻게 Bengalize思에서나 etc.human 방해받지 않는 시간을 많이 확보하시기를 권해드립니다. 예를 들면 아침에 일찍 연구실에 나와서 8시부터 10시까지 방해받지 않고 연구에 집중할 수 있는 시간을 정하고 일을 실행하시기 바랍니다. 여러분들 이제 대학원 생활을 시작하시게 되면 연구실 상황에 따라 다르겠습니다만 대개의 경우에 연구실에서 굉장히 많은 일들이 있습니다. 또 연구실의 선배, 후배, 교수님과 같이 진행하는 연구라든지 회의라든지 그런 부분들이 많이 있기 때문에 여러분들이 조용히 여러분들 책상에 앉 아서 말씀드린 것처럼 이 문제는 과연 어떤 문제인가에 대한 숙고를 하거나 어떤 리서치에 집중할 수 있는 여러분들 혼자만 집중할 수 있는 시간이 생각보다 많지 않을 수 있습니다. 때문에 여러분들이 처음에 연구실에 나가시게 되면 연구실에 나가시게 되면 연구실에 나가시게 되면 연구실에서 진행되는 상황을 먼저 보신 후에 여기 말씀드린 것처럼 예를 들면 1시간 먼저 나와서 연구실이 보통 9시나 10시부터 여러가지 회의라든지 세미나라든지 이런 것이 진행된다고 하면 한 8시나 9시, 1시간 정도쯤에 나와서 여러분들만의 시간을 갖고 그 시간에 수업시간에 들은 내용들에 대한 숙제라든지 과제 같은 걸 하실 수도 있고 아니면 여러분들이 지금 관심을 가지고 있는 것 같은 것들에 대한 숙제라든지 아니면 여러분들이 지금 관심을 가지고 있는 것 같은 것 같은 것들을 리서치 문제나 진행 과정에 대해서 스스로 한번 돌아보시고 숙고할 수 있는 그런 시간으로 활용하시라는 말씀이 되겠습니다. 한 가지 추가로 말씀드린다고 하면 특히 이공계에서는 연구실 생활이 혼자 있는 것이 아니고 약간 단체 생활 비슷하게 동료들과 함께 진행되기 때문에 예를 들어서 여러분들이 나는 8시에 나와서 1시간 정도는 나의 시간을 갖겠다. 경우에 연구실에 동료들에게 또는 선배들에게 그 부분을 얘기를 하고 미리 양해를 받아 놓으시는 것이 좋습니다 예를 들어서 나는 매일 8시부터 9시까지는 제가 한번 공부하는데 집중할 시간을 가지고자 하니 8시부터 9시까지는 방해하지 말아 주십시오 이런 말씀이죠 그런 식으로 본인 혼자 자기의 관심 분야에 집중할 수 있는 그런 시간을 확보하시면 좋을 것 같습니다 제가 이렇게 자꾸 아침에 8시부터 9시 이렇게 말씀을 드리는 이유는 저녁으로 잡을 수도 있겠죠 예를 들어서 일과 시간 5시나 6시가 끝난다고 하면 일과 시간 끝난 다음에 저녁식사하고 7시나 8시부터 나는 시간을 갖겠다 이렇게 정하실 수도 있겠죠 그런데 실제로 생활을 해보시면 대학원에서 저녁 이후에 시간은 또 랩에서 세미나도 하고 여러가지 회의도 잡고 그런 일이 많이 일어나는게 좋습니다. 왜냐하면 낮에 진행을 하다가 시간이 좀 모자라게 되면 자연스럽게 저녁 먹고 하자, 오늘 밤에 하자 하는 식으로 이어질 수가 있겠죠 그 래서 제 생각에는 가능하시면 하루에 시작이 되는 아침 아침에 이런 시간을 잡으면 좋지 않을까 생각이 됩니다 밤 늦게 잡겠다 하실 수도 있겠지만 밤에는 휴식을 하셔야 되겠죠 그래서 가능하면 아침이 좋지 않을까 권해드립니다 또 연구를 할 때는 언제 더 깊게 해당 주제에 대해서 솔루션에 대해서 깊게 파고 들어갈지 어느 부분에서는 깊게 집중하는 것보다 적용하는 영역이나 분야를 더 넓게 확장해 나갈지 어떤 것들은 이 문제와 같이 볼지 어떤 것들은 별도로 볼지 이런 것들을 고려하도록 하십시오 이렇게 해당된 문제를 바라보는 여러 가지 시각이나 그 문제의 범위 그 다음에 방법에 대해서 그때 그때 결정을 해서 집중을 하셔야 되는데 이러한 과정에서 여러분들의 지도 교수님과 또는 선배, 같이 일하는 연구 동료들과 해당된 부분에 대한 토론과 논의를 거쳐서 이 부분을 결정하여 진행하시면 되겠습니다 또 여러분들이 어떤 분야에 대해서 리뷰 페이퍼나 해당된 분야를 공부하시게 되면 항상 현재까지의 Current State가 있습니다 특히 현재 상태의 문제 솔루션에 대해서 그들이 갖고 있는 가정에 대한 어떤 도전적인 질문을 통하여 새로운 솔루션을 찾아가실 수 있습니다 예를 들면 기존의 논문이나 기존의 솔루션은 입력이 동일하다고 가정하고 문제를 풀었다고 하면 여러분들은 한번 그것이 꼭 동일해야 되는가 그것이 다르다고 했을 때는 어떤 문제가 벌어지는가로 한번 도전을 해보시면 왜 그 가정을 통해서 문제를 풀 수밖에 없었는지 또 그 가정을 풀었을 때는 어떠한 양태가 벌어지고 거기에서 여러분들이 어떤 부분들을 찾고 공부할 수 있을지를 할 수 있겠습니다 그러므로 가능하시면 기존에 어떤 정해져 있는 이 문제는 여기까지야, 이 문제는 이런 가정으로 풀었어 라는 부분을 숙지하신 이후에는 한번 그러한 기존의 가정이나 기존의 전제를 한번 풀고 한번 나는 가정을 바꿔서 또는 기존의 전제를 넘어서서 한번 해보겠다 하는 식으로 도전을 해보시는 과정을 통해서 보다 새로운 그런 연구 결과와 솔루션이 찾아질 수 있다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 아울러 해당된 연구 문제는 간단한 문제도 있겠지만 대부분의 경우에 여러 가지 측면에 여러 가지 문제들을 다루고 있는 복잡한 문제들이 일반적입니다 그래서 그 런 문제를 다루기 용이하도록 가능하시면 여러 개로 나누어 접근하여 해결하시는 게 좋겠습니다 물론 말씀드린 것처럼 여러 개의 문제로 나눌 때 여러분의 지도교수님이나 동료, 선배들과 논의와 협의를 거쳐서 적절하게 문제를 나누고 해당된 문제를 담당하시게 되겠습니다 또 다른 연구자들에게 여러분들의 아이디어나 솔루션을 시현하는 방법도 매우 중요합니다 그래서 이러한 시현안은 어떻게 여러분들에게 여러분들의 연구 과정이나 솔루션이나 결과를 다른 사람들에게 어떻게 보여줄지도 같이 고민하면서 연구를 진행하시는 것이 중요하다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 또한 자신만의 단기, 장기 연구목표를 수립하여 연구를 진행하도록 하고 이 과정에서 다른 연구자들과 활발 하게 의사소통 하시기를 권합니다 유명한 이야기로 만약 엔지니어가 되고 싶다면 다른 사람들과 연구하는 것이 좋습니다 또 다른 사람들과 협력하라 라는 말이 있습니다 자신의 연구 문제, 접근 방법, 해결하기 어려운 부분 현재의 결과와 향후 계획 등을 지도교수님은 물론 연구실 동료들 그리고 해당 분야의 여러 연구자들과 커뮤니케이션 하여 서로 논의하고 협력해 나가기를 바라며 연구 논문 작성도 커뮤니케이션의 일환으로 생각하시기 바랍니다 연구자들 사이의 상호 협력이야말로 과학기술과 연구의 협력을 이루는 것입니다 연구자들 사이의 상호 협력이야말로 과학기술과 연구의 협력을 이루는 것입니다 연구자들 사이의 상호 협력이야말로 과학기술과 연구의 협력을 이루 는 것입니다 여러분들이 작성하시는 연구 논문도 만약에 커뮤니케이션의 일환으로 생각하신다면 연구논문에서 여러분들이 굉장히 어려운 문제를 어렵게 풀어서 얘기하는 것보다는 말씀드린 바와 같이 그 문제를 가능하실 게 여러분들이 어떤 방법으로 어떤 어프로치로 적용해서 어떤 결과를 얻었는지 다른 사람들에게 잘 보이고 설명할 수 있는 부분도 매우 중요합니다 설명할 수 있는 부분도 매우 중요합니다 중요한 부분이라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 이러한 측면에서 네 번째 조안은 여러분들의 연구를 논문 등을 통하여 활발하게 출판, 퍼블리시하라는 것입니다. 항상 여러분들 연구하는 과정에서 연구 내용을 어떤 저널에 퍼블리시할지를 생각하십시오. 이때 논문을 낼 때 공동 저자는 그 사람이 어떠한 공헌이 있다면 가능한 넓고 관대하게 결정하도록 하고 대신 저자의 순서는 신중하게 결정하시기를 바랍니다. 여러분들의 논문 작성에 가능한 많은 사람들이 협동할 수 있기를 바랍니다. 논문을 작성할 때는 잘 구성하여 읽기 쉽고 독자들이 흥미롭게 작성하도록 하고 여러분들의 연구실, 조직에서만 사용하는 자 체 용어를 사용하거나 퍼준 표기법에 어긋나지 않도록 주의하실 필요가 있습니다. 또한 여러분들의 연구에 관련된 기존 연구들을 충분하게 포함시키고 정리하여 제시함으로써 독자들에게 여러분들 연구 주제의 중요성과 연구 방법의 타당성을 설명할 수 있고 다양한 방법으로 퍼블리시하기를 권합니다. 예를 들어 학술 저널에 논문을 게재하 는 것뿐이 아니라 국내외 학술 대회에서 논문을 발표하기도 하시고 기사 형태로 기구하거나 특허 문서를 작성하는 등 해당된 주제에 여러분들의 연구에 관한 내용을 작성하시기 바랍니다. 여러분들의 아이디어, 여러분들의 연구 과정, 연구 결과를 여러 가지 다양한 형태로 적극적으로 발표하시기를 권해드립니다. 다섯 번째는 연구의 일관성에 관련된 것입니다. 여러분들의 연구 분야는 대학원에 입학하여 연구실에 오면서 어느 정도는 정해졌다고 할 수 있으며 공부를 계속하면서 점차 구체적인 세부 분야로 깊이 있게 들어가게 될 것입니다. 여러분들의 연교분야와 주요한 연구문제들을 지속적으로 탐색-계발하고 확장해 나가십시오. 이때 특히 논쟁의 여지가 있는 영역에서 긍정적으로 연구하시길 바랍니다. 왜냐면 논쟁의 여지가 있는 분야와 문제는 다른 측면에서는 여러분들에게 아주 큰 성과를 가져올 수 있는 기회가 될 수도 있기 때문입니다. 마지막 여섯 번째는 다른 사람들과 적극적으로 투자할 수 있는 문제입니다. 다시 한번 연구하시기 바랍니다. 자, 마지막 여섯 번째는 다른 사람들과 적극적으로 투자할 수 있는 문제입니다. 자, 마지막 여섯 번째는 다른 사람들과 적극적으로 투자할 수 있는 문제입니다. 활발하게 협동하라는 것입니다. 여러분들이 먼저 좋은 종료가 되어 주변의 좋은 동료들을 만들어 나가십시오. 동료들과 서로 연구 논문 출판을 격려하고 가능하면 논문을 효율적으로 작성하기 위한 협력척의 일종의 버디 시스템을 만들어 운영하도록 하십시오. 특히 작성된 논문의 교정이나 검토에서 서로 상대방의 논문을 봐주는 연구실 동료들과의 버디 시스템은 매우 효과적입니다. 또한 논문의 계제 승인이나 수상 등 어떠한 성취가 있을 경우 동료들과 함께 크게 축하하도록 하고 또 여러분들 스스로에게도 어떤 성취가 있을 때마다 관대한 보상을 하기를 바랍니다. 아울러 여러분들 주변에 연구와 논문 작성을 응원하고 도움을 주는 분위기와 환경을 만들고 지속적으로 유지해 나가시기를 바랍니다. 이러한 분위기와 환경을 만들고 유지하기 위해서 여러분들 연구실의 동료들과 또 지도교수님과 같이 의논하고 필요한 부분이 있다면 건의하여 보다 연구를 잘 수행할 수 있는 편안한 그런 연구실 환경을 만들어 나 가시기를 권해드립니다. 다음으로 학술 논문을 효과적으로 작성하기 위한 가이드라인을 소개해드리고자 합니다. 논문을 작성할 때는 바로 글쓰기에 덤벼들지 말고 먼저 글의 주제와 범위, 구조에 대한 생각과 구상을 하고 이에 기반하여 계획하고 정리하도록 합니다. 이후 이를 기반으로 개요, 아웃라인을 먼저 작성해보기를 권합니다. 또 글을 작성할 때는 지루한 구조를 피하고 가능한 간결하고 명료하게 설명 표현하도록 노력하고 독자가 정해졌다면 대상 독자들이 익숙하고 좋아하는 스타일로 논문을 작성하시기 바랍니다. 또한 속어, 유행어, 반복적이거나 완곡한 표현, 절자법과 문법 오류를 피하도록 최대한 노력할 필요가 있습니다. 이번 강의의 마지막으로 좋은 논문을 작 성하고 퍼블리시게 하기 위한 8가지 팁을 소개해드리고자 합니다. 먼저 좋은 논문을 작성하고 싶다면 논문을 많이, 가능하면 좋은 논문을 많이 읽으십시오. 보다 넓은 범위로 확장해 나가기 위해서는 연구 분야뿐이 아니라 연구 분야가 많아지지 않으면 연구 분야가 많아지지 않으면 연구 분야뿐이 아니라 연구 분야가 많아지지 않으면 연구 분야가 많아지지 않으면 영어 분야가 아닌 부분에 대해서도 폭넓게 논문을 읽는 것이 좋습니다. 또한 스스로의 연구나 논문에 대하여 가능한 객관적이 되도록 하십시오. 자신의 연구 문제와 연구 방법, 결과 등을 제3자의 시각에서 가능한 객관적으로 살펴보고 작성한 논문을 보고 수정하는 것이 필요합니다. 다음, 영어 논문 작성 시에는 좋은 영어를 사용하여 하며 가능한 전문적인 논문을 읽는 것이 좋습니다. 가능한 전문적인 영어 교정을 받으시길 바랍니다. 네번째, 조금 슬픈 이야기지만 연구자들은 게재 거부, 보통 리젝션이라고 하죠. 그와 함께 사는 법을 배워야 합니다. 연구자로서의 모든 경력은 사실 여러 가지 논문을 작성해서 제출하고 또 거절되는 과정과 함께 한다고 보시면 되겠습니다. 그러나 게재 거절로 해당된 논문이 끝났다고 생각하실 필요는 없습니다. 그러나 게재 거절로 해당된 논문이 끝났다고 생각하실 필요는 없습니다. 그러나 게재 거절로 해당된 논문이 끝났다고 생각하실 필요는 없습니다. 심사자들에게 좋은 조언을 받았다고 생각하시고 그 심사자들의 의견을 바탕으로 논문을 더 좋게 수정 보완하여 좋은 결과를 얻을 수 있겠습니다. 그러므로 논문의 게재 거절은 아픈 경험이긴 하지만 좋은 결과를 위해 거쳐가는 일상적인 과정으로 생각하고 받아들이시길 바랍니다. 아울러 많은 경우에 연구가 끝난 후 이제 논문을 쓰자 하는 경우가 많은데 연구가 끝나기 전, 아니 연구의 전 과정에서 나중에 결과를 얻어지면 논문을 어떻게 구성하고 작성할지를 계속 염두에 두어야 합니다. 즉, 필요하면 연구의 진행과정이나 범위도 논문 작성을 고려하여 정해져야 한다는 것을 잊지 마시기 바랍니다. 좋은 논문을 작성하기 위해서는 스스로 심사자, 리뷰어가 되어 보십시오. 연구나 논문을 비판적으로 평가하는 방법에 익숙해지는 것은 자신의 연구나 논문을 개꽃으로 작성하 는 것입니다. 자신의 연구나 논문을 개꽃으로 작성하는 것입니다. 자신의 연구나 논문을 개꽃으로 작성하는 것입니다. 객관적으로 3자의 시각에서 평가하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 또한, 가능한 일찍 논문을 어떤 저널에 제출할지 정하시는 것이 좋습니다. 이때 기본적으로는 각 저널의 홈페이지에서 모포 및 범위를 살펴보십시오. 이를 통해서 해당 저널에 여러분들의 논문을 게재하는 데 필요한 내용이나 범위나 주제를 결정할 수 있으며, 이를 기반으로 연구를 구체화하고 필요한 내용과 결과를 정할 수 있습니다. 이를 기반으로 연구를 구체화하고 필요한 내용과 결과를 정할 수 있습니다. 마지막으로, 좋은 논문이라면 그 논문의 품질이 제일 중요합니다. 가능한 좋은 저널에 좋은 논문을 준비해서 내도록 하고, 계속적으로 더 좋은 논문을 작성하고 더 좋은 저널에 낼 수 있도록 도전하시기를 바랍니다. 이상으로 논문 작성법 및 연구윤리 과목의 첫 번째 강의를 마칩니다. 이번 강의에서는 전반적인 강의 소개와 함께 대학원 학생으로서 연구와 논문 작성이 어떤 의미이고 어떤 마음가짐과 자세가 필요한지를 설명드렸 습니다. 경청해 주셔서 감사합니다. 2주차 제목: Effective process for writing good academic papers 내용: 안녕하세요. 공과대학 산업공학과 노상도 교수입니다. 오늘은 논문 작성빈 연구윤리 과목의 두 번째 강의로서 좋은 학술 논문을 작성하기 위한 효과적인 절차, 작성 프로세스에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 이번 강의의 내용은 수잔 스티븐슨과 스티브 비트모어가 2002년 출판한 엔지니어링 커뮤니케이션의 전략과 2009년 제가 우리 대학의 여러 교수님들과 함께 출판한 과학기술 커뮤니케이션에 있는 일부 내용을 발췌해 정리한 것임을 말씀드립니다. 혹시 오늘의 강의에 대해서 더 관심이 있는 분은 이 두 권의 책을 참고해 주시기 바랍니다. 자, 먼저 좋은 학술 논문을 작성하기 위한 효과적인 방법과 절차에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 일반적으로 학술 논문 작성은 계획, 플래닝 단계, 구상 및 준비, 인벤팅 단계, 초고 작성, 드래프팅, 그리고 교정과 최종편집, 리바이징 앤 에디팅의 단계로 진행됩니다. 교정과 최종편집, 리바이징 앤 에디팅의 단계로 진행됩니다. 교정과 최종편집, 리바이징 앤 에디팅의 단계로 진행됩니다. 계획 단계에서는 논문 작성 일정을 수립하고 독자를 정의하고 분석하여 논문의 목적을 정합니다. 계획 단계에서는 논문 작성일정을 수립하고 독자를 정의하고 분석하여 논문의 목적을 정합니다. 계획 단계에서는 논문 작성일정을 수립하고 독자를 정의하고 분석하여 논문의 목적을 정합니다. 계획 단계에서는 논문 작성일정을 수립하고 독자를 정의하고 분석하여 논문의 목적을 정합니다. 사실 논문의 목적을 정하는데 있어서 제일 중요한 부분 중의 하나는 사실 논문의 목적을 정하는데 있어서 제일 중요한 부분 중의 하나는 부분 중의 하나가 내가 작성하는 논문을 읽을 독자가 어떤 사람인지를 정의하고 분석하는 것이 제일 중요한 부분 중의 하나라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 다음, 구상 및 준비 단계에서는 이 논문을 작성하고 어떤 내용을 담을 건지에 대한 아이디어를 구상하고 논문 작성 작업을 준비합니다. 초고 작성 단계에서는 초고, draft죠. 초고를 효율적으로 작성하고 이때 글쓰기에 장애 요인들에 대한 대처가 필요하겠습니다. 마지막으로 교정 및 최종 편집 단계에서는 처음 초고 단계에서 작성된 초고를 꼼꼼하게 교정하고 문법 오류와 오자를 확인합니다. 이 단계에서는 지루함과 완벽주기에 대한 효과적인 대처가 필요하다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 지금 말씀드린 글쓰기의 장애 요인에 대한 대처 방법, 또 지루함과 완벽주의의요인, 이 단계에 대해서는 이후에 자세히 설명드리도록 하겠습니다. 학술 논문 작성은 말씀드린 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 그리고 교정이 순서대로 이루어지게 되는데요. 이것이 한 번에 이루어 지는 것이 아니라 이 세 가지 단계가 여러 차례 상호적으로 서로 영향을 받으며 수행되는 반복적이고 재규적인 과정이라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 아래의 편은 재미난 조사 결과를 보여주고 있는데요. 숙론되지 않은 저자, 글을 그렇게 비효율적으로 썩 만족스럽지 않게 논문을 작성하는 저자의 경우에는 전체 논문 작성 시간의 50% 정도를 구상 및 준비 작업에 나머지 시간 중 45%를 초고 작성을 위해 보내고 최종 교정 단계에서는 5% 남짓의 시간을 사용한다고 합니다. 최종 마무리입니다. 최종 마무리를 통해 논문의 완성도를 높일 수 있는 교정 단계에 매우 적은 시간만을 투입하기 때문에 전반적인 논문의 완성도가 높지 않게 될 위험이 큽니다. 이 부분을 한 번 살펴보면 어떤 논문을 작성하는데 내가 시간이 열흘이 있다고 봤을 때 5일 정도는 논문을 어떻게 쓸까 구상을 하고 나머지 4일 반 정도는 글을 쓰는데 보낸 다음에 그러고 보니까 반나절밖에 시간이 안 남은 거죠. 그러니까 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 그래서 초고를 작성하고 막 헐레벌떡 교정까지 작성해서 제출하게 됩니다. 결과적으로 글을 작성하는 프로세스 전반도 비효율적일 뿐이 아니라 최종 결과물도 그렇게 높은 수준으로 다듬어지지 못하는 그런 결과를 얻게 된다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 일반적인 이야기입니다. 반면에 숙련된 저자는 표 밑에 있는 부분에서처럼 논문 작성 시간의 25%를 받을 수 있습니다. 반면에 숙련된 저자는 표 밑에 있는 부분에서처럼 논문 작성 시간의 25%를 받을 수 있습니다. 그러니까 한 2일 정도를 구상 및 준비. 그러니까 한 2일 정도를 구상 및 준비에 쓴 다음에 35% 정도를 초고 작성 단계에 투입을 합니다. 그러니까 한 3, 4일 정도를 초고 작성에 투입을 해서 결국엔 60% 정도. 그러니까 전체가 열흘이라고 하면 한 6일 정도까지 초고 작성을 완료한 후에 나머지 40% 시간. 그러니까 어느 정도는 상대적으로 충분히 긴 시간을 최종적인 교정. 그러니까 작성된 드래프트를 보고. 수정하고 꼼꼼하게 오류를 찾고 더 낮게 인프로브하는 그런 시간에 40%를 투여한다는 이야기가 되겠습니다. 교정 및 마무리에 충분한 시간을 투입하기 때문에 논문의 최종 완성도를 높일 수가 있겠습니다. 또 구상 및 준비 단계에서 25%의 미만을 투입을 한다고 했는데 구상 및 준비 단계에서 25% 만에 투 입을 하려면 사실은 어떻게 해야 될까요? 이 이야기는 25%만에 투입을 하려면 어떻게 해야 될까요? 이 이야기는 25%만에 투입을 하려면 어떻게 해야 될까요? 우리가 무엇을 manera까. 우리가 전 시간에 말씀드린 것처럼 우리가 연구를 하는 과정에서 미리 지속적으로 내가 이 결과를, 연구 진행되는 과정에서 내가 지금 하고 있는 이 연구를 나중에 scares여� unjust. 우리가 전 시간에 말씀드린 것처럼 우리가 연구를 하는 과정에서 미리 지속적으로 내가 이 결과를, 연구 진행되는 과정에서 내가 지금 하고 있는 이 연구를 나중에 settled 될 때 don 지금 하고 있는 이 lieutenant 연구 진행되는 과정에서 내가 지금 하고 있는 이 lieutenant 방충행이 café 찍을 때는 논문을 어 떤 내용으로 어떻게 쓰겠다 이런 논문에 대한 아이디어를 지금 하고 있는 causes to be due to excuse purpose 지속적으로 구상하고 있다는 의미를 가지기도 합니다 그러니까 어찌보면 약간 좀 능숙한 논문을 잘 쓰는 연구자들은 평소에도 도 sonra는OL 논문을 잘 쓰는 연구자들은 평소부터 머릿속에 계속 연구를 하는 과정에서도 논문을 어 떻게 써야지 이런 결과가 나온다고 하면 어느 저널에 어떤 어떻게 해서 논문을 써야겠다 하는 생각을 머릿속에 계속 담고 있다가 이제 논문을 쓰자고 했을 때 빨리 드래프트를 완성한 다음에 충분한 시간을 가지고 꼼꼼하게 수정을 혼자 할 수도 있겠습니다만 동료들과 함께 여러 단계의 수정작업에 충분한 시간을 투여하는 그런 사람이라고 볼 수 있겠고요 상대적으로 조금 과장해서 말씀드리면 논문을 좀 이렇게 불편하고 비효율적으로 쓰는 친구들은 평소에 논문에 대해서 큰 고민을 하고 있지 않다가 자 이제 논문을 쓰자 하면 그제서야 어떤 논문을 어디에 쓰지 고민을 하다 보니 구상 및 준비 단계에 시간도 많이 걸리고 그러다 보니까 시간이 쫓겨져서 초고작성을 하다 보니 그 시간을 하고 보면 그 드래프트를 더 다듬고 수정할 때 쓸 시간이 며칠 안 남은 거예요 그러다 보니까 논문의 퀄리티가 높지 않게 되는 그렇다라는 말씀입니다 한마디로 논문 작성에 대해서 여러분들이 주어진 시간을 가능한 앞쪽에서 좀 빨리 수명을 하고 뒤쪽에서 좀 여유 시간을 확보해서 논문의 완성도를 최대로 높이는 방향으로 여러 분들의 시간을 사용하는 것이 바람직하다 이런 말씀이 되겠습니다 자 각각의 논문 작성 단계에 대해서 어떤 것이고 어떻게 하는 것이 효율적인 건지 한번 살펴보도록 하겠습니다 첫 번째는 계획 단계입니다 성공적인 논문 작성자는 말씀드린 대로 가능한 빨리 계획을 수립을 하는데 논문 작성을 결정하자마자 바로 시작하고 가능한 여러 개의 작업을 나누며 연구를 완료하기 전부터 논문 작성을 위한 중요한 작업들을 시작합니다 말씀드린 것처럼 평소에 연구를 하는 과정에서도 논문을 쓸 때 예를 들면 이 그래프를 이런 그래프를 이런 형태로 넣어야지 하면 그 그래프를 미리 가지고 있는 사람이라는 말씀이죠 또한 좋은 논문 작성을 위해서는 논문을 읽을 독자가 어떤 사람이 있 는지를 묻고 파악을 하며 작성할 논문의 목적을 명확하게 결정하게 됩니다 논문을 작성할 때 글의 독자와 이 독자에 따라 결정되는 목적을 정하는 것은 매우 중요하다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 왜냐하면 논문의 독자가 어떤 사람인지 그들의 전문성과 해당 주제에 대한 이해도 호감 등을 사전에 파악함으로써 작성할 논문의 목적을 더 정확 하게 정할 수 있기 때문입니다 이 페이지는 독자 분석을 위해 사용되는 여러 가지 질문들을 보여줍니다 여러분들의 글을 읽을 사람은 어떤 사람인지에 따라서 여러분들의 글을 읽을 사람은 어떤 사람인지에 따라서 기술적으로 전문가들, 관리자 또는 사업가가 어떤 사람들인지 기술적으로 전문가들, 관리자 또는 사업가가 어떤 사람들인지 또 그들이 왜 여러분들의 논문을 읽을 것인지 그들이 여러분들에게 논문 작성을 의뢰한 동기는 무엇인지 만약에 여러분들이 작성한 논문을 독자들이 봤을 때 그들이 여러분들이 작성한 논문의 제목이나 초록을 보고 관심을 가져서 볼 텐데 어떤 부분에 관심이 있겠느냐 하는 그런 이야기죠 여러분들의 논문을 바탕으로 그들이 어떤 행동을 취하게 될 건지 그들은 어떤 정보를 알고 싶을지 그런 부분들에 대해서 한번 생각해 보는 것이 필요하겠습니다 독자들이 주제에 대해 얼마나 잘 알고 있는지 또 얼마나 많은 배경 지식과 정보를 필요로 하는지 독자들이 여러분들이 사용하는 기술 용어에 대해서 익숙한지 독자들이 어떤 정보를 필요로 하고 여러분들이 그들의 요구를 해결하는데 필요한 정보들을 얼마나 어떤 형태로 가지고 있는지 필요한 정보들을 얼마나 어떤 형태로 가지고 있는지 필요한 정보를 가지고 있는지 만약에 그렇지 않다면 여러분들이 어떤 것을 좀 찾아야 되고 어떤 형태로 어떤 내용들을 정리해서 제시해야 될지 어떤 내용들을 듣고 어떤 내용들을 빼야 될지 이런 것들이 독자들이 여러분들이 작성한 논 문을 읽으면서 어떤 부분에 대해서 궁금하고 필요로 할지에 따라서 결정된다는 부분을 강조해서 말씀드리고 싶습니다 다음은 논문의 목적을 정하기 위한 과정에서 사용되는 질문들입니다 이 논문을 통해서 여러분은 무엇을 얻고 싶습니까? 논문의 목적을 명확하고 간결하게 기술할 수 있을지 기술하시길 권해드리고요 논문의 목표가 독자들의 기대와 어떤 관련이 있는지 독자들의 여러분들의 목표를 공유하고 있는지 그러니까 독자들이 여러분들의 논문을 보면서 갖는 기대나 목적과 여러분들이 논문을 통해서 독자들에게 전하고 싶은 이야기와 제시하고 싶은 내용이 일치해야 된다는 말씀이죠 그래서 그런 목표가 어느 정도 잘 맞는 건지 그렇지 않다면 일치하지 않는 부분이 뭔지 를 한번 따져보실 필요가 있습니다 결국엔 여러분들의 목표와 독자들의 기대를 모두 충족시킬 수 있는 방법이 무엇일지를 생각하시고요 독자들이 무엇을 알고 무엇을 모르는지 여러분들은 어떻게 그것을 또 판단할 수 있는지 논문에서 고려해야 할 태도나 가치에는 어떤 것들이 있는지를 여러분들이 한번 스스로 생각해 보시고 생각해 보시고 생각해 보시고 하실 필요가 있습니다 이러한 질문들을 무슨 시험 보듯이 각각의 질문에 대해서 답을 해 보는 형태라기 보다는 일종의 체크리스트처럼 여러분들이 이 질문들을 쭉 보면서 여러분들이 독자를 분석하고 목적을 결정하는 데 있어서 일종의 가이드라인처럼 활용을 하시면 좋다고 생각이 됩니다 아울러 계획 단계에서 좋은 글쓰기 환경을 준비해서 확보하는 것이 좋습니다 제가 지난 시간에 여러분 연구실에서 스스로 조용하게 집중해서 할 수 있는 그런 시간을 만들라고 말씀드렸는데요 글쓰기도 마찬가지입니다 글쓰기를 하고 있는데 주변에서 다른 방해나 이런 부분들이 있으면 가뜩이나 글 쓰는 게 어려운데 골치 아픈데 쉽지 않겠죠 그래서 가능하면 조용하고 방해받지 않을 수 있고요 중단 없이 논문 작성 작업을 진행할 수 있는 자신만의 글쓰기 환경을 구상하시는 게 필요합니다 이때 글은 한 번씩 읽어보시고 글쓰기 환경을 구상하시는 게 필요합니다 이때 글은 한 번씩 읽어보시고 글쓰기 환경을 구상하시는 게 필요합니다 글쓰기는 아무래도 컴퓨터 모니터를 보면서 쓰시기 때문에 조명이라든지 그런 부분에 신경을 쓰고 신체적으로 편안함을 향상시키도록 합니다 일반적인 이야기입니다만 글쓰기를 하는데 특히나 주변에 시끄럽거나 번다 하면 사실 글쓰기에 집중하기 어려워집니다 왜 그러냐 하면 글쓰기 자체가 별로 즐겁고 그런 행위가 아니기 때문에 그렇습니다 사실 글쓰기는 좀 괴롭죠 괴롭고 하기 싫은 경우가 대부분이거든요 그래서 가뜩이나 즐겁지 않은 골치 아픈 행위를 하고 있는데 주변에서 방해가 되고 잘 안 보이고 소리가 나고 시끄럽고 하면 글쓰기가 굉장히 어려워집니다 그래서 보통 글을 쓸 때는 조용하게 여러분들이 안정적으로 방해받지 않으면서 안락하게 집중해서 글을 작성할 수 있는 그런 환경이 필요하겠습니다 저를 포함해서 제가 알고 있는 많은 연구자들이 나름만의 자기만의 환경을 가지고 있는데요 어떤 분은 커피숍에 가서 조용히 앉아서 글을 쓰는 게 잘 되는 분도 있고 어떤 분은 도서관에 열람실에 조용히 있는 게 자기한테 너무 편하다는 사람도 있고 어떤 사람은 자기 책상에서 음악을 들으면서 하는 게 좋다는 사람도 있고 이것은 여러분들 스스로에게 자기만의 편안한 글쓰기의 효율을 높일 수 있는 그런 환경을 가지고 있는데요 어떤 분은 커피숍에 가서 조용히 앉아서 글을 쓰는 게 잘 되는 분도 있고 어떤 분은 커피숍에 가서 조용히 앉아서 글을 쓰는 게 잘 되는 분도 있고 그런 환경을 찾도록 노력하셔서 그런 환경을 계속 유지하고 구성하시라는 말씀이 되겠습니다 모두에게 동일한 부분은 아니겠습니다 여러분들 자신만의 글쓰기 친화적인 환경을 찾아서 만들어 나가라 하는 부분을 말씀드리고 싶습니다 또한 논문 작성에서 사용하는 컴퓨터와 소프트웨어의 사용능력을 증진시키는 것이 좋은데요 논문 작성 시 많이 사용되는 워드프로세서, 아래안글이나 MS Word 같은 것이 되겠죠 그것뿐이 아니라 여러분들은 과학기술 2공개 분야에서는 그림이나 표, 수식 이런 것들을 많이 작성하게 되는데 이때 여러분들이 많이 쓰시는 아래안글이나 MS Word뿐이 아니라 다른 여러 가지 소프트웨어들을 사용하는 경우도 많이 있습니다 대표적인 게 마이크로소프트 엑셀 같은 소프트웨어들이죠 이런 여러 가지 소프트웨어의 사용법을 일단 잘 익히시는 것이 필요합니다 필요하다면 시간 투자를 하셔서 필요 하다면 시간 투자를 하셔서 이런 사용법들을 배우십시오 만약 논문 작성이 어떤 특정한 작업 환경에서 진행되어야 한다면 해당 환경에 있는 장치나 프로그램들을 빨리 파악하고 그 사용법을 숙지하고 배울 필요가 있습니다 효율적인 학술 논문 작성을 위한 논문 작성의 두 번째 단계는 구상 및 준비 단계입니다 구상 및 준비 단계에서는 논문에서 다룰 주제들과 내용을 구상 및 준비 단계에서는 논문에서 다룰 주제들과 내용을 정리하고 조직화하여 배열하게 되는데 이 조직화하고 배열하는 과정에서 여러분들이 작성하는 논문의 구성이 결정되게 됩니다 그래서 보통 개요, 아웃라이닝은 학술 논문 작성 중 내용을 구성하여 전체적인 흐름을 보이는데 사용되는 가장 일반적인 전략 중의 하나라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 예를 들어 이 슬라이드에서 보여지고 있는 것은 여러분들이 많이 쓰시는 마이크로소프트 워드의 개요 기능을 예로 보고 계십니다 이렇게 전체 문서의 아웃라인을 먼저 잡아놓고 해당된 아웃라인에 대하여 내용을 붙이는 형태로 작업하시기를 권해드립니다 여러 가지 주제와 내용을 조직화하기 위해서 그래픽을 이용하기도 하는데 이 페이지에서 보여주고 있는 마인드 맵핑이 대표적인 방법 중 하나입니다 아마 여러분들 중학교나 고등학교 때 마인드 맵핑 방법을 이용해서 여러 가지 아이디어나 어떤 사문에 관련해서는 여러 가지 아이디어나 어떤 사문에 관련해서는 여러 가지 아이디어나 어떤 사문에 관련해서는 관련된 것들을 연관짓고 정리해 보셨을 겁니다 마인드 맵핑은 알고 계신 바와 같이 아이디어 간의 관계를 보여주면서 아이디어를 생성하고 지각적으로 구성하는 방법으로 논문을 구상할 때 여러 소주제들과 내용들을 조직화하는데 상당히 유용합니다 꼭 이 마인드 맵핑 방법뿐이 아니라 여러분들이 알고 계신 또 유용하게 생각되는 여러 가지 방법들을 통해서 관련된 주제나 소주제들 또 내용들을 이렇게 그래픽하게 정리해 보시는 것도 상당히 좋은 습관이라고 생각합니다 여러 가지 주제와 내용들을 조직화하기 위해 그래픽을 이용하는 방법 중에서 여러분들 알고 계시는 텍사노마이징 분류 방법도 있습니다 이 방법은 예제에서 볼 수 있는 것처럼 공통 특성을 기반으로 여러 가지 아이디어를 역시 지각적 으로 하고 또 그룹핑 지을 수 있는 전략 메소돌로지가 되겠습니다 논문 작성은 이렇게 하고요 논문 작성에서는 아이디어와 내용의 조직화를 위해 논리적인 순서 패턴이 사용됩니다 학술 논문에서 많이 사용되는 패턴으로는 시간별 사건 발생 순서에 따라 어떤 프로세스를 설명하는 연대순 물리적인 연관 관계에 따라 어떤 객제를 설명하는 공간순 유사성과 차이점에 대한 설명을 통해 기존 설계와 새로운 설계를 비교하는 비교 대조 방법 독자들의 관심에 따라 정해지는 중요도에 따라 비교 대조 방법을 사용하는 방법이 있습니다. 독자들의 관심에 따라 정해지는 중요도에 따라 비교 대조 방법을 사용하는 방법이 있습니다. 중요한 것에서 덜 중요한 순으로 설명하는 중요도순 문제 설명, 방법 제시, 해결책 설명과 권장사항으로 진행되는 문제 해결순 일반적인 요점을 설명하고 이후 보다 자세한 설명이나 특별한 예제가 뒤따르는 일반에서 특별로 기술하는 방법 등이 있습니다 조직화에서 이상과 같이 널리 알려진 패턴을 사용하면 논문에서 관련 내용을 알기 쉽게 설명하고 전체적으로 논리적인 흐름을 잘 따르도록 해 줄 뿐만 아니라 독자들이 내용을 쉽게 이해하고 오래 기억할 수 있도록 해주는 효과가 있습니다 여러분들 가장 익숙한 것이 아마 시간순, 공간순이 될 것 같은데요 연대순 같은 경우에 예를 들어서 관련 연구에 대한 히스토리를 설명할 때 1960년대에 이런 연구들이 있었고 70년대에 이런 연구들이 있었고 80년대에 이런 연구들이 있었고 이 런 식으로 연대순으로 설명하는 것이 굉장히 자연스럽죠 물리적으로는 예를 들어서 흔히 여러분들이 일정이나 여정을 설명한다고 했을 때 우리나라 기준으로 얘기했을 때 서울에서 출발해서 대전, 대구, 부산 이렇게 설명하는 것이 더 좋겠죠 서울 설명하고 부산 설명했다가 대전 했다가, 대구 했다가 이렇게 왔다 갔다 하는 것보다는 순서대로 독자들이 익숙하고 다음을 알고 있는 그런 어떤 순서대로 설명하는 것이 우리 관계자들이 하는 것보다도 더 잘 알고 있는 것 같아요. 과학기술 쪽에서 얘기하는 논리적인 어떤 순서 패턴에 부합된다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 이제 효율적인 학술 논문 작성을 위한 논문 작성의 세 번째 단계로 초고 작성에 대해서 말씀드리겠습니다 일반 적으로 초고 작성에는 네 가지 방법이 있습니다 즉, 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성 그리고 교정을 결합해서 한 번에 진행하는 방법이 있고요 두 번째로는 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 교정을 결합해서 한 번에 진행하는 방법이 있고요. 두 번째로는 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 교정을 결합해서 한 번에 진행하는 방법이 있고요. 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 그리고 교정을 각각을 완전히 구별해서 별도로 진행하는 방법 세 번째로는 구상 및 준비와 초고 작성을 같이 진행하고 이후 교정 작업을 진행하는 방법 네 번째로는 구상 및 준비를 먼저 진행하고 이후 초고 작성과 교정을 같이 진행하는 방법들입니다 일반적으로 네 가지 방법들이 많이 쓰이는데요 분량이 짧은 논문일수록 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 그리고 교정을 결합해서 같이 진행하는 방법이 더 효율적입니다 그러나 분량이 길고 내용이 굉장히 복잡할수록 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 그리고 교정을 각각 구분하여 별도로 진행하는 법이 더 효과적이라고 알려져 있습니다 일반적으로 학술 대회나 저널에 제출하는 5 페이지에서 15 페이지 정도 분량의 논문은 구상 및 준 비와 초고 작성을 먼저 진행하고 이후 교정을 진행하는 세 번째 방법이 가장 널리 쓰이고 있는데요 이후 교정을 진행하는 세 번째 방법이 가장 널리 쓰이고 그다음에 이후 교정을 진행하는 세 번째 방법이 가장 널리 쓰이고 направья 있습니다. 가장 효과적이라고 알려져 있습니다. 이제 각각의 초고작성 방법별로 장단점을 말씀드리도록 하겠습니다. 제일 먼저 구상 및 준비, 초고작성, 그리고 교정을 결합하여 한 번에 진행하는 방법입니다. 이 방법에서는 어떻게 작성해 나갈지 명확한 아이디어가 떠오르지 않더라도 쉽게 요점과 문장을 써내려 나갈 수 있습니다. 때문에 이 방법에서는 글쓰기를 바로 시작할 수 있으며 특정 문제에 대한 명확한 해결책이 없을 때 특히 유리합니다. 그러니까 어떤 주제가 정해지면 앉아서 생각나는 것을 쭉 써내려 나가는 방법이죠. 높은 창의력을 보이고 글쓰기가 상대적으로 자유롭기 때문에 일반적으로 시작이 어려운 경우 논문 작성을 시작할 수 있는 좋은 방법입니다. 다음은 구상 및 준비, 초고작성, 그리고 교정을 시작하여 한 번에 진행하는 방법입니다. 다음은 구상 및 준비, 초고작성, 그리고 교정을 완전히 각각 구별하여 별도로 진행하는 방법입니다. 이 방법에서는 초기에 논문의 내용, 형식과 구성에 대한 세심한 계획을 세우고 이후 각 세션별로 가능한 빨리 작성이 됩니다. 마지막으로 여러모로 걸쳐서 집중적으로 완전한 교정을 진행하는 방법이 되겠습니다. 일반적으로 사용자 설명서나 교재와 같 이 굉장히 내용이 방대하고 긴 문서인데 각 세션별로 내용이 다른 경우에 많이 사용되는 방법입니다. 다음은 일반적으로 논문 작성에 가장 널리 쓰이는 적합한 방법으로 알려져 있는 구상 및 준비와 초고작성을 같이 진행하고 이후 교정을 진행하는 방법입니다. 이 방법에서는 구상 및 준비와 초고작성을 결합하여 먼저 진행하고 이후 교정작업을 진행하기 때문에 교정작업에 필요한 충분한 시간을 남겨주는 것이 중요합니다. 아까 말씀드린 것처럼 이런 교정작업이 필요하다면 교정 작업을 시작하기 전에 교정작업을 시작하는 방법이 중요합니다. 교정작업이 시작되는 방법은 교정작업의 첫 번째 방법입니다. 교정작업에 충분한 시간을 투자해야 최종적으로 완성된 완성본의 품질을 높은 수준으로 얻을 수 있습니다. 특히 이 방법에서는 글쓰기 모멘텀의 유지가 무엇보다 중요하며 일단 초고작성을 시작한 이후에는 첫 번째 초안작성 작업을 마칠 때까지 가능하면 작성을 멈추지 않는 것이 중요합니다. 때문에 구상 및 준비나 초고작성에서 작성하다 보면 생각이 안 나는 경우나 문제에 부딪히는 경우가 있는데 이때 그 문제 해결에 시간을 넣어 시간을 낭비하지 말고 이 부분은 나중에 작성, 또는 이 부분은 나중에 자료를 찾는다 하는 식으로 그냥 표시만 해놓고 해당 부분을 넘어갑니다. 초고작성에서 중요한 것은 글쓰기 모멘텀을 잊지 않고 처음부터 끝까지 드래프트를 완성하는 것이 중요하다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 드래프트는 어디까지나 드래프트고 요. 또 뒤에 충분한 교정시간을 남겨놨기 때문에 그 드래프트가 완성이 되면 이것을 가지고 높은 수준으로 수정하고 할 시간이 충분합니다. 수정하고 할 시간이 충분히 확보되어 있기 때문에 이것이 가능합니다. 이것은 일반적으로 5에서 15페이지 정도 되는 비교적 짧은 문서나 긴 문서에 포함되는 하나의 섹션을 작성할 때 효율적으로 적용되는 방법이 되겠습니다. 이 방법에서는 논문을 작성하는 행위 그 자체가 새로운 아이디어, 당면 문제에 대한 새로운 접근 방법 그리고 문제에 대한 새로운 해결책 제시에 단서가 됩니다. 또한 비록 완성도는 매우 낮더라도 드래프트니까요. 일단 초안이 완성되어 있기 때문에 어느 정도의 만족감을 얻을 수 있고 첫 초고 작성에 신경을 가진 노력을 덜 들였기 때문에 여유를 가지고 논문을 더 확정해 나가거나 교정하는데 시간을 사용할 수 있게 됩니다. 이 방법에서는 말씀드린 것처럼 글쓰기 모멘텀 유지를 위한 방해받지 않는 환경 확보가 필수적이며 구상 및 준비와 초고 작성 진행 후에는 교정 작업을 시작하기 전에 충분한 휴식을 갖는 것이 필요합니다. 이 적절한 휴식의 형태를 우리가 창의적 휴식이라고 부릅니다. 창의적 휴식이란 논문 작성 작업에서 벗어나서 마음과 두뇌를 쉬게 해주는 시간을 말하는데 창의적 휴식을 통해 보다 창의적이고 의욕적으로 또 객관적이고 꼼꼼하게 이후에 벌어지는 교정 작업을 진행할 수 있는 것이 가능해집니다. 창의적 휴식 후에는 자신이 작성했던 논문도 다르게 보이고 이전에는 생각하지 못했던 새로운 아이디어가 떠오르기 때문입니다. 그러니까 이런 것이죠. 내가 열흘이라는 시간이 있을 때 처음에 한 5일 정도 시간을 투자해서 또는 5일하고 반나절 시간을 투자해서 구상을 하고 여러 가지 자료를 수집하고 구상을 한 다음에 초고 작성을 집중적으로 진행하는 것이죠. 초고 작성을 진행하는 과정에서는 가능하면 쉬지 마시고 완성도까지 만들게 됩니다. 초고 작성이 완성되면 일단 힘들죠. 그동안 쉴 틈 없이 초고 작성을 했으니까 그런 다음에 한 반나절 정도를 쉰다는 말씀입니다. 쉴 때는 초고 작성 문서 작성 작업을 좀 잊고 음악을 듣거나 영화를 보거나 그야말로 휴식을 취하게 되는데 이러한 중간에 쉬는 작업을 통해서 반나절이나 하루 쉬었 다가 그 다음에 작성했던 초고를 보게 되면 내가 왜 이렇게 작성을 했지? 전혀 다른 측면도 보이게 되고 기존에 작성했던 부분의 잘못된 부분이나 또 기존에 초고 작성할 때 아이디어가 떠오르지 않아서 비워놨던 부분들도 이제 채워 놓을 수가 있게 된다 하는 부분이죠. 그것이 어떤 창의적 휴식의 긍정적인 효과가 되겠습니다. 주의사항은 제 경험에 의하면 창의적 휴식 때 다 좋은데 술을 마시거나 이렇게 완전히 정신을 혼미하게 하는 그런 행위가 있으면 별로 효과가 좋지는 않은 것 같습니다. 그래서 제가 좀 권해드리기로는 창의적 휴식 때는 완성된 초고를 손에 들고 또는 USB에 넣어서 주머니에 넣고 편안한 시간을 영화를 보든지 커피집에 가서 커피나 맛있는 커피나 음식을 먹든지 하는 시간을 가지시기를 권해드립니다. 마지막은 구상 및 준비를 먼저 진행하고 이후 초고 작성과 교정을 진행하여 같이 진행하는 방법입니다. 이 방법은 일반적으로 15분 정도가 되고요. 15에서 50페이지 정도의 좀 더 긴 문서를 작성하는 경우나 제안서, 특허 또는 법률문서처럼 단어 하나하나, 표현 하나하나의 선택이 매우 중 요한, 매우 정확해야 하는 이런 경우에 효과적입니다. 이 방법에서는 조직화가 매우 중요하며 그렇지 않으면 교정 진행 중 잠시 중단했을 때 다음에 와야 하는 내용을 떠올리기가 힘들어집니다. 대신 꼼꼼하게 계속 완성도 높게 작성을 하기 때문에 그때까지 작성한 내용에서 다음 아이디어를 얻을 수 있는 경우가 많기 때문에 글을 쓰다가 막히게 되면 내가 지금까지 작성한 글을 앞에 몇 문 단락을 읽어보면서 검토를 하면 그 다음에 글을 작성해 나갈 수 있는 글쓰기 장애를 극복하는데 도움이 된다는 측면의 장점도 가지고 있습니다. 초고 작성에 중요한 것은 작성을 멈추지 않고 모멘텀을 유지하는 것이라고 말씀을 드렸는데요. 논문을 작성할 때 흔히 부딪히는 글쓰기 장애를 극복하는 것입니다. 논문을 작성할 때 흔히 부딪히는 글쓰기 장애를 극복하는 것입니다. 논문을 작성할 때 흔히 부딪히는 글쓰기 장애를 극복하는 것입니다. 글쓰기 장애 요인들이 2페이지에 설명되어 있습니다. 보통 계획에 관련된 것, 여러분들 많이 경험하셨죠? 언제까지 뭘 해야 되는데 이런 것, 환경적 요인에서 기인한 것, 주제와 관 련된 것, 단어에 의해서 발생한 것, 아, 이걸 표현하는 좋은 단어가 뭘까? 이런 고민을 하다가 시간이 가는 거죠. 또 형식에서 기인한 것, 독자와 관련된 것, 기대와 위기에서 비롯된 것 등이 있습니다. 철저한 준비와 전략적 대응을 통해 철저한 준비와 전략적 대응을 통해 이러한 장애 요인을 극복하는 것이 성공적인 초고 작성과 효율적인 문서 작성에 필요하며 유능한 저자들은 이러한 장애 요인들을 다루는 방법들을 잘 알고 잘 만들어 놓고 있는 사람들이라고 생각하시면 되겠습니다. 효율적인 학술 논문 작성을 위한 논문의 마지막 단계는 교정 및 최종 완성 단계입니다. 교정은 연구 논문의 오류를 제거하여 신뢰도를 높이고 또 완성도를 높이고, 또 완성도를 제거하기 위해 가장 중요한 과정입니다. 꼼꼼하고 완전한 교정 작업에는 상당한 시간이 소요되기 때문에 말씀드린 것처럼 초기 계획 단계에서 교정에 필요한 충분한 시간을 확보해 놓으셔야 합니다. 또한 자신이 작성한 논문을 다시 객관적인 시각으로 여러 차례 살펴보고 꼼꼼하게 수정하는 교정 작업은 쉬운 작업이 아니기 때문에 교정 수행 전에 좀 차 기적 휴식을 갖는 것이 좋습니다. 교정 작업 중에는 논문을 객관적이고 비판적으로 3자의 시각에서 읽는 것이 중요하며 내용 구성, 설득력 있는 강조, 형식, 규칙, 단락조직, 문장 구조와 단원 슬립 등 여러 가지 레벨과 측면에서 꼼꼼하게 교정을 진행해야 합니다. 교정을 효율적으로 진행하기 위한 전략을 살펴보면 첫 번째, 한꺼번에 모든 측면을 살펴보기 어렵기 때문에 여러 차례에 걸쳐서 수행하는 것이 좋습니다. 무슨 말씀이냐 하면, 일단 첫 번째는 전체적으로 글의 흐름이 괜찮은지를 보기 위해서 한번 보시고요. 그때는 예를 들어서 5자가 눈에 띄어도 그냥 무시하는 거죠. 두 번째는 꼼꼼하게 단어들이 잘 괜찮은지 단어들 위주로 보고 세 번째는 5자를 한번 쭉 보고 이런 식으로 한 가지의 측면으로 전체적으로 한번씩 쭉 보면서 여러 번을 교정하는 측면이 더 효과적이라는 말씀이 되겠습니다. 또 컴퓨터 스크린을 보고 진행하기보다는 종이에 출력하여 진행하는 경우가 많습니다. 이거는 아마 개인의 취향이 되겠습니다. 나는 컴퓨터 스크린을 보고 하는 게 더 좋아. 그런 경우는 괜찮겠습니다만 일반적으로 종이에 출력해서 보시면 종이를 들고 앞뒤를 갈 수 있을 뿐 아니라 노트를 자유자재로 할 수 있기 때문에 종이에 출력해서 진행하는 것을 아직까지는 일반적으로 권해지고 있습니다. 그런데 여러분들은 특히나 디지털에 더 친숙하시거나 디지털에 더 친숙하시거나 그런 경우가 많습니다. 그런 경우가 많습니다. 그래서 편하신다면 컴퓨터 스크린을 보고 진행하는 것도 괜찮겠죠. 또한 때때로는 큰 소리를 읽으면서 오류를 찾아내기도 합니다. 참 신기하게도 눈으로 보고 찾아지지 않았던 오자나 오류 같은 것들이 소리를 내서 읽기 교정이라고 하죠. 소리를 내서 읽으면 눈에 띄기도 합니다. 그래서 이런 것도 한번 시도해 보실 필요가 있고요. 전반적인 논문의 흐름을 검토하기 위해서는 문서의 개요를 확인하는 것이 효과적이고요. 문서의 개요를 확인하는 것이 효과적이고요. 아까 보여드린 것처럼 워드프로세서의 아웃라이닝 기능 같은 것들을 아까 보여드린 것처럼 워드프로세서의 아웃라이닝 기능 같은 것들을 활용하시면 좋겠습니다. 또 반복되는 문제의 경우에는 목록을 작성해서 빠짐없이 수정이 될 수 있도록 활용하시면 좋겠습니다. 일반적으로 학술 논문의 교정은 본인이 4차례에서 5차례 또 다른 사람에 의해서 2, 3차례 결과적으로 총 7번에서 8번은 최소한 진행하는 것이 필요하다고 얘기합니다. 3자에 의한 교정 진행 시에는 나중에 그 사람에게 그 사람이 논문의 독자가 될 사람들을 찾아서 의뢰하는 것이 제일 좋고요. 여러분들의 대학원 동료, 같은 연구실의 학생들, 또 이들이 서로 상대방의 논문을 보고 교정해주는 형태의 버디 시스템을 구성해서 운용해주시는 것을 적극 권장합니다. 여러분들 대학원 연구실 동료들은 같이 연구를 하는 동료일 뿐 아니라 논문을 작성하는 과정에서 서로 도움을 주는 그런 버디가 되실 수 있습니다. 아울러 전체적으로 논문이 잘 적성되었는지 확 인하기 위해서는 도입부 부분을 다시 작성해보는 것도 좋은 방법이 되겠습니다. 학술 논문의 완성을 위한 교정 작업을 어렵게 만드는 것은 두 가지가 있는데요. 첫 번째가 완벽주의이고요. 두 번째는 지루함, 작업의 어려움이라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 먼저 완벽주의는 좋은 논문을 작성하는데 도움이 되긴 하지만 이 완벽주의가 지나치 게 되면 교정 작업이 어려울 수 있습니다. 교정 작업을 한없이 길게 만들고 효율을 떨어뜨리게 됩니다. 완벽주의를 극복하기 위해서는 교정과 최종 편집에 투입할 수 있는 시간과 에너지에 대한 제한을 명확하게 설정해놓고 작업을 시작하시는 것이 좋습니다. 그러니까 내가 교정 작업은 금요일까지 마친다. 앞으로 4시간 동안만 한다 하는 식으로 마치는 것이 좋고요. 또한 오자, 맞춤법 오류 등 낮은 수준의 편집 작업보다는 전반적인 글의 흐름, 장과 절의 균형이나 밸런스, 부족한 부분이나 불필요한 내용들을 넣거나 빼는 것들 같은 높은 수준의 교정 작업에 더 집중하는 것이 좋습니다. 왜냐하면 낮은 수준의 편집 작업, 오자라든지 맞춤법 같은 것들은 대개의 워드 프로세스에서 자동으로 해결해주는 것이 많고 또 이런 교정 작업만 전문적으로 수행해주는 웹사이트들도 많이 있습니다. 또 논문 게재가 확정되면 출판사의 전문 편집자가 기계적으로 이 부분들을 수행해줍니다. 그렇기 때문에 여러분들이 교정 작업에서 정말 집중하고 있는 것들은 기계적으로 이 부분들을 수행해줍니다. 교정 작업에서 정말 집중해 야 할 부분은 뭐냐면 이 논문이 잘 작성이 되었는가, 구성의 흐름, 들어갈 내용이 다 들어갔는지 순서는 괜찮은지, 밸런스가 맞는지 같은 부분들에 집중하시는 것이 좋겠습니다. 아울러 논문 발간 후 여러분들이 작성한 논문에 대한 독자들의 반응을 명확하게 파악하고 논문 작성 시 생각하고 예상했던 것과 실제 독자들의 반응 차이를 보고 분석해보는 것이 그 다음 논문을 쓸 때 가장 중요한 부분입니다. 그래서 이 논문이 큰 도움이 된다는 부분을 말씀드리고 싶습니다. 교정 작업에서 만나게 되는 지독한 지루함, 작업의 어려움인데요. 이것을 극복하기 위해서는 보다 복잡한 부분에 초점을 맞춰 당면한 작업의 난이도를 높이는 것이 좋습니다. 즉, 올바른 단어 선택을 위한 단 순 편집 작업이 아니라 어떤 단어가 독자에게 부흥할 수 있는지를 고민하는, 또 전체 흐름이 괜찮은지 이런 고차원적인 고민과 노력이 교정 작업을 지루하지 않습니다. 이것이 창의적인 작업이기 때문에 그렇습니다. 또한 먼저 흥미로운 작업들을 나열하고 흥미로운 작업일수록 나중에 진행하시는 것이 좋겠습니다. 아울러 교정 작업 자체가 흥미롭지 않다는 점을 분명히 인정하고 지루함과 어려움으로 인해서 집중력이 떨어질 때는 다시 교정 작업 진행에 주의를 기울일 수 있도록 어떤 체크리스트라든지 소홀함이 없도록 그런 체제를 설정해놓고 교정 작업을 체계적으로 진행하는 것이 좋겠습니다. 이상과 같이 이번 시간에는 좋은 학술 논문을 작성하기 위한 효과적인 절차, 프로세스에 대해서 공부해 보았습니다. 경청해 주셔서 감사합니다. 3주차 제목: Academic Papers in Science and Engineering, Selecting a Target Journal for Your Academic Manuscript 내용: 안녕하세요. 논문 작성법 및 연구윤리 강좌에서 제3강부터 제6강까지를 담당하게 된 에너지과학과의 김성웅입니다. 제가 담당하게 된 제3강에서부터 6강까지는 아무래도 논문 기술에 있어서 기술적인 부분을 조금 많이 말씀을 드리도록 하게 될 것 같습니다. 먼저 제3강부터 말씀을 드리면 아카데믹 페이퍼라는 게 여러분들이 지금까지 공부해 오셨던 교과서하고는 전혀 다른 내용을 담게 됩니다. 그래서 보통 공부하셨던 텍스트 북에서나 보았던 과학적인 사실 그리고 연구 방법들에 대한 것과는 전혀 다르게 조금 많이 생각을 하고 기술을 해야 되거나 작성을 해야 되는 것들이 있습니다. 그래서 그런 부분들에 대해서 말씀을 많이 드릴텐데요. 먼저 제3강에서는 여러분들이 작성하고 있는 논문들을 어떤 저널에다가 투고를 할지 그리고 어떤 저널에 여러분들의 연구 결과가 실리게 되서 많은 사람들이 읽게 될지 이것들을 고민하는 시간을 가져보도록 하겠습니다. 먼저 그러면 시작을 하도록 할텐데 여기서 생각을 조금 해야 될게요. 페이퍼라는 게 도대체 무엇인지 그리고 논문이라는 게 도대체 어떤 것인지. 그래서 어떤 논문을 작성하는지. 먼저 제가 먼저 작성해 드리겠습니다. 먼저 제가 작성해 드리겠습니다. 어떤 논문을 작성하는지. 그리고 그게 보통은 아카데믹한 페이퍼라는 것을 생각을 하게 되는데요. 많은 기술서들이 있고 보고서들이 있습니다만 그런 것들과는 전혀 차원이 다른 게 바로 이 논문이고 과학적인 기술을 요구하는 그리고 우리가 학계에서 많이 보고 있는 페이퍼라는 것인데요. 과학 분야와 엔지니어링 분야에서 그런 페이퍼들은 도대체 어떻게 무엇을 생각을 하고 써야 되는 건지에 대해서 말씀을 한번 드려보도록 하겠습니다. 과학 분야와 엔지니어링 분야에서 그런 페이퍼라는 것을 생각을 하고 raises against ЕnSogan? 바로ensen 우리가 원하시는 질문을 말하고 싶다는 거죠. 먼저 이 강좌는 여러 교수님들께서 나눠서 진행을 하고 계시기 때문에ilogewhovarwassedesandthe Carrieo하고 계시기 때문에 많이 알 수 있습니다 first of allthis lesson has been 요�onz교수님들께서 나누어서 진행을 하고 계시기 때문에 confident이다 and strength cent Transport 모든 교수님들의 생각이 다 동일하지는 않습니다h benompovovokable 그리고 또 많은 교수님들이 사는 논문들을 쓰시지만 모든 교수님들의 생각은 다 다릅니다uanton Gimmeu 공통적인 부분에서는 기술적인 부분이 있겠지만 논문이라는 것 자체가 사람과 사람의 대화의 연속이기 때문에 어떤 내용을 어떤 생각을 가지고 그 사람들과 즉 본인이 쓰셨던 논문을 어떤 독자들이 읽을지 그리고 그 독자들이 어떤 생각으로 읽을지 이런 것들을 고민하면서 쓸 수밖에 없는 게 아카데믹 페이퍼입니다. 그렇게 되면 지금까지 여러분들이 공부해 오셨던 책, 텍스트북과는 전혀 다른 내용을 담고 있을 수밖에 없는데요. 기본적으로 논문을 쓰는 게 굉장히 어려운 일입니다. 그 이유는 여러분들이 생각하시는 것을 어떤 독자들이 어떻게 읽을지 고민을 하기 때문이고 그 독자들이 읽을 때 여러분들의 생각을 정확히 과학적인 사실에 기반해서 이해를 할 수 있게 해야 되기 때문에 굉장히 고통스럽습니다. 그래서 앞으로 지금 현재 이 강좌를 듣고 계시는 대학원생 여러분들 논문을 한 번이라도 작성을 해 보셨던 분들이거나 지금 작성을 할 기회가 있으신 분들은 아마 여기 카툰에서 보여지는 것처럼 굉장히 부담이 크고 고통스러운 나날들을 조금 지내실 텐데요. 그 이유를 한번 말씀을 드리고 왜 이건 고통보다도 즐거움인지를 한번 또 말씀을 드려보도록 하겠습니다. 먼저 위에 카툰에서 보여지는 것처럼 한 학생이 자기 생각을 그 스크린에 바로 보여줄 수 있다면 하고 생각을 하고 있습니다. 예, 저도 그렇습니다. 저도 지금 연구를 하면서 제가 얻은 연구 결과들을 어떻게 말을 해야 될지 어떤 점이 중요할지 여러 독자들에게 말을 할 때 그저 그냥 생각을 어떻게 쓸까 고민을 하는 시간들이 많이 있습니다. 그래서 그 고민하는 시간들에는 손이 바로 키보드에 가지가 않죠. 써야 되는데 쓰기가 참 어렵습니다. 그래서 계속해서 생각합니다. 아 쓰자 어떻게 쓸까 쓰자 이러고 있는 시간들이 굉장히 깁니다. 그러다가 이제 괴로워하죠. 보통은. 이런 과정들은 당연한 과정이고 어렵기 때문에 당연한 과정이라고 생각을 하면 되는데요. 근데 이 어려움은 실제로 그렇게 큰 어려움이 아닐 수도 있습니다. 그 이유를 오늘부터 3강부터 6강까지 좀 차근히 한번 말씀을 드릴 텐데요. 그 이유를 오늘부 터 3강부터 6강까지 좀 차근히 한번 말씀을 드릴 텐데요. 또 하나의 케이스는 아래 보시는 카툰인데요. 이 카툰에서는 지금 어떤 교수님께서 학생이 쓴 논문을 다시 고쳐서 참석을 해주셔서 보냈습니다. 학생에게. 학생이 그걸 보고 아 이걸 모두 다 고치셨네요 라고 합니다. 단어 하나 그리고 문법 하나 이런 거를 고치지 않고 다 고쳤습니 다. 논문의 전체를 다 고쳐버린 건데요. 단어 하나 그리고 문법 하나 그리고 문법 하나 그리고 문법 하나 그리고 문법 하나 그리고 문법 하나고 우리가 교수를 SAIь하는 거거든요. 나는 그저 후史의 현실 돌� beating을ization 실수로 고쳐버려 가지고 있어서 그는 다 고치는 게 Showsa cambio란 desdeック 아니면 것보다 더 시씩 기출한 거를 하겠죠. 나는 그서forderitat,다는 키워드를 반영 보셨는데. 그 교수님께서 하시는 말씀이 어떤 부분을 고치는 것보다 지적을 해주는 것보다 전체를 다 써버리는 게 쉽 다 라고 말씀을 하십니다. 한국의 prepare for a success이라는 것이 하나의 교수로 나오죠. 여기에 굉장히 중요한 점들이 들어가 있는데요. 아. 얘기를 한도 끝이agner입니다. 시작과 끝까지 1 2 3 4 4 Poland. 스 truly bones. 그런데 그 작성된 스토리는 개인의 생각입니다. 즉, 학생들, 여러분들께서 쓰시고 계시는 생각과 그 논문을 가지고 같이 연구하셨던 공동연구자들의 생각이 다 담겨져 있습니다. 그 사람들마다 다 다른 생각들을 하나의 논문으로 하기 때문에 어떤 한 사람이 논문을 쓰기 시작하 면 그 사람의 생각이 처음부터 끝까지 다 담기게 됩니다. 그래서 여러분들이 생각하셨던 오류라는 것들이 분명히 있을 수도 있는데요. 그 오류라는 것을 하나로 고치게 되면 그 사람이 다시 고치고 있는 사람이 다시 고칠 때는 그 오류 하나만을 잡는 게 아니고 그 사람의 생각을 처음부터 끝까지 나타내 줘야 되기 때문에 전체를 고치는 게 대단히 쉽습니다. 실제 저도 저희 학생들이 가지고 오는 페이퍼를 2월 페이지, 20페이지 하더라도 하나하나 단어 그리고 문장 하나하나 고치다 보면 전체를 고쳐놓고 보면 도대체 이건 내가 왜 고쳤지? 왜 이런 말로 했지라는 생각을 하게 됩니다. 그래서 또 다시 전체를 고치는 기간을 또 가지게 됩니다. 그러면 제가 고쳤던 부분에 대해서 는 여기 옆에 카툰에서 보여주는 것처럼 교수님께 가져갔더니 고쳐주셔서 다시 그 고친 것을 받아서 다시 작성을 했고 교수님께 다시 보여주면 그 교수님께서는 다시 다 고칩니다. 그리고 그 교수님께서는 다시 다 고칩니다. 그리고 또 다시 여러분들에게 돌려주죠. 그래서 이 사이클이 영원합니다. 솔직히 말씀을 드리면. 그리고 여러분들이 오케이 하기 전, 여러분들은 오케이 했어도 교수님께서 오케이 하시거나 공동연구자들이 오케이 하기 전까지는 서밋하기가 어렵죠. 그래서 서밋할 때까지의 이 과정들은 굉장히 지난하기도 하고 어렵기도 하고 끝이 없을 수도 있습니다. 그렇지만 이렇게 고쳐가는 과정들에서 가장 중요한 거 하나는요. 여러분들의 생각이 얼마만큼 잘 담겼 는지 그리고 그게 처음부터 끝까지 일관성이 있게 잘 담겼는지가 대단히 중요하게 됩니다. 뭐 이런 과정들을 겪으면서 수백 편의 논문을 쓰고 수십 편의 논문을 써보면서 잘 쓸 수 있게 되고 뭐 그런 상황이 오기는 하지만 처음에 여러분들이 작성을 하는 거 논문이란 게 어떤 건지 읽기만 했다가 실제 작성을 하기에는 상당히 어려운 점이 있습니다. 그래서 그런 점들을 같이 얘기를 하면서 그렇게 어려운 것만은 아니다 라는 말씀을 드리고자 합니다. 처음에 서두에서 말씀드렸다시피 논문 작성이라는 것은 여러분들의 생각을 다른 사람들이 즉 독자 독자들이 어떻게 볼지 그리고 독자들이 보기 전까지도 많은 연구자들 그리고 논문의 에디터들과 소통을 하게 됩니다. 그 소통을 하는 방식에 있어서 여러가지 커뮤니케이션을 하는 방식에 있어서 여러가지 커뮤니케이션을 하는 방식에 있어서 여러가지 커뮤니케이션을 하는 방식이 있습니다. 하는 방식이 사람과 사람의 사이이기 때문에 여러분은 혼자여도 다른 사람들이 그 다른 사람들은 다 각자의 생각들이 있기 때문에 항상 다른 반응들이 오게 됩니다 그 반응의 몇 가지 것을 말씀을 드리고 그 반응들에 대해서 뭐 어려워하는 필요가 없다는 것을 한번 말씀을 드려보도록 하겠습니다 어 1 예로 어떤 페이퍼를 작성을 해서 이렇게 뭐 논문을 투고를 했습니다 투고를 하고 다행스럽게 에디터를 통과를 해서 에디터를 통과를 한다는 말씀은 어 이제 논문을 투고하는 과정 그리고 논문이 어떻게 만들어지는지에 대한 과정은 나중에 말씀을 드릴 텐데요 다행스럽게 에디터를 통과를 해서 리뷰 프로세스를 들어갔습니다 이 리뷰 프로세스를 들어가서 온 레프리의 내용입니다 이 논문은 어떤 어떤 어떤 주제에 대한 이 논문은 무엇을 뭐 리포트하고 있겠습니까? 이 리뷰 프로세스에 대한 이 논문은 무엇을 뭐 리포트하고 있겠습니까? 이 리뷰 프로세스에 대한 이 논문은 무엇을 뭐 리포트하고 있겠습니까? 근데 재밌는 결과가 있다 재밌는 결과는 1번 2번 이렇게 뭐 정리를 해 줬습니다 이렇게 정리를 해 줬다 라는 말은 어쩌면 이 레프리는 이 논문을 정말 열심히 읽어줬다 일 수도 있구요 그리고 대충 읽어보고 대충 이라는 말은 여러분들이 쓰신 abstract 초록에 대해서만 읽고 저 정도는 정 리를 할 수 있습니다 그러니까 그거를 꼭 여러분들에게 이렇게 레프리들이 적어준 것들을 모두 정리하고 정리할 수 있습니다. 모두 다 믿을 필요는 없다는 말씀인데요 왜냐하면 초록만 보고도 저 두 개 정도에 여러분들이 논문을 잘 작성을 하셨으면 저렇게 중요하다라고 하는 포인트들 두 가지 혹은 서너 가지 정도에 대해서는 경험이 많은 그리고 오랫동안 연구를 해오고 논문을 쓰셨던 분들의 입장에서는 매우 쉽게 저것들을 픽업을 할 수가 있습니다 그래서 그 결과들에 대해서는 굉장히 재미있다 라고 말씀을 해 주셨습니다 그래서 그 결과들에 대해서는 굉장히 재미있다 라고 말씀을 해 주셨습니다 그런데 이런 결과들은 전혀 시그니피션드 하지도 않고 네이처나 네이처 저널 에 실릴 만큼 충분하지 않은 노벨티를 가지고 있다라고 합니다 그러면 이 워딩은 도대체 뭐지? 재미있다 라고는 하는데 안된다 이렇게 되면 여러분들은 굉장히 서운해 하실 겁니다 왜 재미있다고 하면서 안된다고 할까? 그래서 앞으로 말씀드릴 내용이 이렇게 표현을 하는 것입니다. 그런데 어떤 사람들의 생각을 잘 읽어 볼 필요가 있습니다 여러분들의 연구 결과가 재미있긴 하지만 여러분들이 쓰셨던 논문 네이처나 네이처리서치 저널들의 투고가 되서 실리기에는 아직은 뭔가 시그니피션드가 부족하다는 표현이 있겠습니다 저게 여러분들의 능력이나 여러분들의 연구결과를 매우 안 좋게 보는 건 절대 아닙니다 그래서 결코 저런 문장에 대해서 리뷰 어포인트들에서 저 사람의 생각을 잘 읽어봤다가 너무나lexikwill적으로 할 수 있을 지금은Phisher della munir criticer의 Cam ан�� cab Pattone 입장에서 사람의 생각을 그냥 그대로 받아들일 필요는 없습니다. 왜냐하면 저 레프리의 생각은 재밌다고도 하면서도 부족하다고 하지만 저건 일 개인의 생각입니다. 저 부족하다는 거가 여러분들의 논문의 가치, 논문의 가치보다는 여러분들의 연구 결과의 가치를 결정하지는 않습니다. 그렇기 때문에 저 일 개인의 레프리의 생각에 동의를 할 수도 있고요. 동의를 하지 않을 수도 있습니다. 그래서 보통은 동의를 하지 않습니다. 왜냐하면 자기의 연구 결과를 다른 사람이 보고 안 좋다라고 생각을 했으면 동의를 안 하는 게 정상입니다. 거기서 동의를 해 버리면 여러분들은 연구 논문을 쓰실 때부터 잘못 쓰셨을 수도 있습니다. 그래서 동의를 하지 않고 다시 대화를 하게 됩니다. 소통을 하는 거죠. 그래서 이 논문에서는 실제로 우리가 어떤 것들을 했지만 조금은 우리가 믿었지만 좀 수준ip쯔를 한 번 깨끗하게 정획 글을zer access주지고 다시 정답íamos 뭔가는he 망ardı 배 miracles 이런 이런 오� whoa 내가 있어요 east entered v crue crystal 시� gear 뒤중 invited another you controller x m

불구하고 이 웍의 significance 중요도는 충분하지 않다 하이 퀄리티 저널의 네이처 같은 이렇게 표현이 됩니다 네이처 사이언스 이런 하이 임팩트 저널에서는 어려울 수도 있겠습니다만 그게 여러분들의 결과들을 아까 말씀드렸던 것처럼 연구 결과들을 매우 안 좋다라고 판단하는 것은 아니다 라는 말씀을 다시 한번 드립니다 그래서 이렇게 표현을 하는 warrant 하지 않다 publication 할 정도로 충분하지 않다 라고 하는 것은 저 레프리의 생각일 뿐입니다 그렇게 되면 이 레프리는 그런 생각을 했으면 그것보다는 조금 더 낮은 단계의 낮은 레벨의 논문에 투구를 할 것을 이제 뭐 suggestion을 하게 되죠 보통은 저렇게 suggestion 합니다 그러면 여러분들은 또 suggestion을 받을 때에 그 논문에 갈 수도 있지만요 저 말을 인정을 할 수도 있기 때문에 그렇게 되면 네이처라든지 에디터가 또는 레프리가 레프리는 동의를 할 수도 있습니다만은 기본적으로는 다른 사람들이 다시 여러분들의 논문을 보게 됩니다 그렇게 되면 또 한 번에 이런 과정들을 겪기 때문에 그 과정을 겪기 전에 이 레프리가 어쩌면 조금의 misunderstanding이 있었을

이렇게 알게 됐다면 여러분들이 하실 수 있는 방법은 크게 두 가지가 있죠. 그래, 포기할게. 아니면 열심히 읽지 않았으니 다시 한번 대화를 해서 소통을 하고 그 생각을 바꿔야 되겠네 라고 하실 수 있습니다. 저 같은 경우는 저도 일개인이기 때문에요. 저 같은 경우는 항상 두 번째의 선택지를 선택합니다. 항상 다시 얘기를 합니다. 다시 얘기를 하고 정말 많은 얘기를 거치면서 안 될 때 포기를 하고 다른 논문으로 다른 저널에 투고를 다시 하게 되기도 합니다. 이렇게 리젝을 당하고 리젝을 당해서 받아들이고 다른 논문에 내기까지 여러 사람들과 여러 사람들의 그 가까운 생각이 다 다른 생각들을 소통을 하게 되는 과정들이 굉장히 오랜 시간이 걸립니다. 그래서 이런 생각들을 본인의 생각을 논문을 쓰시고 계시는 여러분들 학생분들의 그 생각들 그리고 그것을 교수님들과 그리고 공동 연구자들과 정리를 하면서 그 생각을 다른 사람들에게 정확하게 전달을 하고 정확하게 왜 이 연구가 더 훌륭한 연구이고 과학적으로 가치가 있는지를 정리해내는 것입니다. 정확하게 말할 수 있는 그런 방법들을 여러분들이 잘 아시는 게 매우 중요하다고 생각을 하고 있습니다 그래서 이렇게 많은 사람들과 소통을 하는 데 있어서 여러분들이 이제 기술적으로 논문이라는 것은 이런 거 부다 라는 것을 조금 아실 필요가 있는데요 그 논문은 정말로 여러분들이 인터넷에서 검색을 하시면서도 금방 파악이 되시겠지만 정말 많은 전원이 있고 그 전월마다 굉장히 많은 논문들이 항상 출판이 되고 있습니다 그래서 이 수많은 출판된 논문들 중에서 여러분들이 어떤 논문을 선택을 하셔야 하는지 그리고 왜 선택을 해야 되는지 그런 선택의 과정들에 대해서 한번 말씀을 드려보도록 하겠습니다 보통 이렇게 많은 논문들은 그 논문들을 그냥 여러분들이 아시는 것처럼 어디에서부터 어디까지 분야에서부터 또는 레벨에서부터 레벨까지 고려를 해서 외부부 사항을 고려하고 있는 것입니다 그래서 이런 것들을 클래리베이트 사이언스 라는 곳에서 클래리베이트 아날리틱스 라는 곳에서 이렇게 분류를 해 놓고 여러분들이 쉽게 어떤 논문이 나의 연구 결과 그리고 왜 이 논문에 가야 될지 이런 것들을 정리할 수 있게 판단할 수 있게 도와주고 있습니다 여기 보시는 것처럼 SCI라고 많이 들어보셨을 텐데요 사이언티픽한 논문들은 보통 SCI나 SCI-E 엔지니어링이나 기초과학에 대한 논문들은 저 두 논문들 중에서 가장 중요한 논문들입니다 그래서 각각의 분류에 속하게 되어 있는 논문들에 대해서 여러분들이 어떤 논문들이 있는지 쳐다보게 되고 그 논문들에 투고를 하게 되는 과정이 있습니다 그 투고를 하게 되는 과정에 선택을 하는 과정에 있어서 첫 번째 여러분들이 고민을 하시는 보통은 저도 그렇습니다 그렇지만 고민을 하시는 분류할 수 있는 방법이 임팩트 팩터라고 하는 파라미터가 있습니다 이 임팩트 팩터는 여러분들이 논문을 어느 논문에 투고를 할지를 결정해주는 매우 중요한 수단이 될 수도 있는데요 실제로 본인들이 생각하는 연구 논문이 매우 대단하다고 생각을 하면 임팩트 팩터가 매우 높은 저널 그리고 조금 이거는 이 분야에서는 중요하기는 하지만 긴급한 정도도 아니고 조금 이거는 이 분야에서는 중요하기는 하지만 긴급한 정도도 아니고 남들도 이 정도는 다 보여주고 있으니 임팩트 팩터가 어느 정도 선에서 있는 저널 이런 식으로 고르시게 됩니다 그 고르는 거는 여러분들이 직접 고르시기도 하고 공동 연구자들과 같이 고르시기도 하는데요 예를 들어서 이 임팩트 팩터가 뭘 얘기를 해주는지를 잘 생각을 해 보시면 왜 골라야 하는지를 아실 수가 있습니다 이 임팩트 팩터의 숫자는 논문의 레벨을 결정을 하기도 하지요 그런데 논문의 레벨을 어떻게 결정하는지에 대해서는 그런데 논문의 레벨을 어떻게 결정하는지에 대해서는 여기 임팩트 팩터를 계산하는 방법에서 쉽게 아실 수 있습니다 2년 동안 어떤 잡지에서 퍼블리시가 된 논문의 숫자와 그런 퍼블리시된 논문들이 2년 동안 얼마만큼 많이 인용되어 있는지 그 비로 비례로 결정을 하게 됩니다 그러면 논문의 숫자는 적고 사이테이션 넘버가 많다 즉 다른 연구자들이 이 잡지에 출판이 된 논문들을 많이 인용을 하거나 즉 다른 연구자들이 이 잡지에 출판이 된 논문들을 많이 인용을 하거나 즉 다른 연구자들이 이 잡지에 출판이 된 논문들을 많이 인용을 하거나 그 연구 결과가 좋던 나쁘던 많이 인용을 했다고 하면 임팩트 팩터는 높습니다 많이 인용을 했다는 뜻은 인용을 하지 않을 수도 있기 때문에요 많이 인용을 했다는 뜻은 인용하지 않은 사람들과 인용을 한 사람들 정말 많은 연구자들이 읽었다는 뜻이 됩니다 많은 사람들이 읽을 수 있다 그러면 많은 사람들이 중요하다고 생각하는 연구 결과들이 나오는 잡지 라고 생각합니다 그러면 많은 사람들이 중요하다고 생각하는 연구 결과들이 나오는 잡지라고 생각을 합니다 그래서 영국 독등국회의에서 기영경 기입 위원장과 zdee.cf을 사연을 해석하고 있었다는 내용을 상상하시며 그래서 여러분들도 그런 하이 임팩트 저널의 논문들을 가지고 공부를 하고 계실 수도 있습니다. 그렇기 때문에 많은 사람들이 읽히기를 바라면서 논문을 내는 거지 몇 명의 사람들만 읽을 수 있으면 좋겠다라고 생각을 하고 논문을 작성을 하고 그 고통스러운 시간들을 참아가면서 논문을 작성을 하지는 않습니다. 그래서 보통은 임팩트 팩터를 기준으로 해서 나의 지금 쓰고 있는 논문은 어느 정도 많은 사람들이 읽히기를 바라고 그 읽히기를 바라는 것도 그 논문마다 분야의 브로드한 스콥이 다 넓을 수도 있고 좁을 수도 있고 다 다릅니다. 그래서 그런 저널을 선택하는 데 있어서 첫 번째로 많은 사람들에게 읽힐지 그리고 그 본인들의 논문의 연구 결과의 중요도를 고민해서 고르게 됩니다. 실제로 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 had 어떤 Apa 어떤orsa 어떻게 어떤 어떻게 어떻게 어떻게 이렇게 이렇게 이렇게 좋겠습니다. 물론 그래서 제가 선생님과 дело는 이렇게 나오게 됩니다. 어떤 한 사람의 논문일 수도 있지만 구글 스칼라를 치기만 하면 제목 밑에 항상 몇 번의 인용이 되었습니다. 라고 써져 있습니다. 몇 번의 인용이 되어 있는 게 중요하죠. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 읽고 그 연구 결과의 중요도가 결정이 되니까요. 그래서 보통은 여기처럼 사이언스라든지 네이처 피직스라든지 여러분들이 아시는 굉장히 높은 레벨의 저널들에 항상 많은 인용도가 기록되게 됩니다. 그래서 임팩트 팩터가 높은 저널에 많이 투고를 하고자 하는 겁니다. 기본적으로 임팩트 팩터가 높은 저널을 가지고자 하는 것보다는 내 연구 결과가 많은 사람들과 소통을 하게 되면서 많은 사람들이 인정을 하고 받아들이고 그 연구 결과를 다시 이용을 하고 이런 과정들을 겪고자 했기 때문에 이런 높은 인용도를 가지는 하이 임팩트 저널에 투고를 하게 됩니다. 그러면 여러분들은 항상 이렇게 높은 저널에만 투고를 할 것이냐 이런 문제가 발생을 하게 되는데요. 실제로는 그게 매우 어려운 과정이 기 때문에 어려운 일이기 때문에 여러분들이 투고를 하는 논문들을 잘 결정을 해야 될 필요가 있습니다. 그래서 그 결정하는 방법들이라든지에 대해서 간단하게 말씀을 드리겠습니다. 개인적으로 저한테만 물어보신다고 하면 개개인의 성향이 다 다르기 때문에요. 저는 항상 높은 임팩트 팩터를 추구하고요. 항상 높은 임팩트 팩터를 추구를 해서 많은 실패의 과정들을 겪고 낮은 임팩트 팩터의 논문까지 퍼블리시가 되기도 합니다. 그렇게 많은 시간을 소요하면서까지 왜 이렇게 높은 임팩트 팩터를 내려고 노력을 하는지에 대해서 말씀을 해보면 논문이라는 것은 어떤 논문에 투고를 해야 될지 그리고 어떤 논문에 실려야 될지 그걸 굉장히 중요하게 고민을 해야 되는데요. 왜냐하면 논문을 퍼블리싱하는 목적이 있습니다. 그리고 그 목적은 많이 읽히기를 바라기 때문입니다. 많이 읽히기를 바라니 높은 임팩트 팩터를 요구를 원하게 될 거고요. 그렇게 되면 높은 임팩트 팩터는 실제로 빠른 시간에 퍼블리싱이 됩니다. 낮은 임팩트 팩터보다는 높은 임팩트 팩터에서 빠른 시간에 퍼블리싱이 되는 케이스가 많은데요. 그렇게 되면 이 빠른 시간 안에 내 논문 연구 결과를 세상에 보여주고서는 다른 많은 연구자들과 항상 경쟁 관계에 놓여 있으시기 때문이죠. 이 경쟁 관계도 어렵지만 이 경쟁 관계를 이겨서 빠른 시간 안에 나의 좋은 연구 결과를 좋은 연구 저널에 투고를 한다는 점이 그리고 퍼블리싱을 한다는 점이 매우 중요하게 됩니다. 어떤 논문을 결정을 할지는 결정을 하는데 몇 가지 생각을 해봐야 되는 포인트들이 있습니다. 먼저 비저빌리티를, 비저빌리티를 높여야만 합니다. 여러분들의 연구는 연구자이시기 때문에요. 여러분들의 연구 결과를 좋은 연구 결과를 많은 사람들에게 보여주면서 여러분들이 누구다 라고 하는 게 보여지게 되는데요. 이것을 향상시키기 위해서 논문을 결정하기도 합니다. 그리고 여기처럼 시간과 노력을 세이브를 하고자 합니다. 왜냐면 임팩트 팩터가 높은 저널에서부터 투고를 하게 되면 본인들이 썼던 논문이 많이 리젝이 될까 하는 생각을 하고요. 그래서 이 논문을 제출할 수 있는 가능성도 있죠. 그렇다 보면 시간이 다시 들어가게 되고요. 그리고 논문을 똑같은 형식으로 제출을 하지 않고 다시 고쳐야 되는 노력이 또 들어가게 됩니다. 그래서 이런 시간들을 그리고 퍼블리싱 될 때까지의 사람들과의 소통을 하는 시간들까지 고려를 하게 되면 충분히 그런 시간들을 아끼고자 하는 노력이 고민을 할 수 있는 포인트가 생깁니다. 그리고 또 하나는 그것과 함께 재생을 할 수 있는 것입니다. 대출했던 연구 논문들에서 퍼블리싱이 될 때까지 퍼블리싱이 안 되고 리젝이 되는 이 상황들을 많이 겪으실 수도 있습니다. 그래서 이런 것들을 좀 줄이기 위해서 많은 좋은 가장 적절한 논문들을 여러분들이 선택을 하시게 됩니다. 그래서 보통은 이렇게 몇 가지의 생각들을 하게 되는데요. 여러분들이 논문을 고르실 때 가장 먼저 생각을 하실 점은 여러분들이 어떤 연구를 하시는지에 대해서 생각을 하셔야 됩니다. 하고 계시고 그리고 여러분들이 직접 어떤 연구 논문들을 전월들을 읽고 계시는지를 잘 한번 생각을 해보시면 됩니다 그러면 그 연구는 여러분들이 읽고 계시는 전월들은요 여러분들의 연구 결과 비슷하고 그리고 그 연구 결과를 공부를 하기 위해서 많은 그 잡지를 읽고 계실 겁니다 논문들을 그래서 보통은 여러분들이 읽고 계시는 논문들의 투고를 하는게 정상적입니다 그러면 여러분들이 배우시고 있고 공부를 하시고 있기 때문에 높은 레벨의 전월들일 가능성이 매우 높습니다 그래서 항상 높은 레벨부터 낼 것이냐에 문제가 있지만 이렇게 몇 가지의 전월들을 후보들을 결정을 하실 수가 있습니다 여러분들이 직접 보고 공부하고 있는 논문들에 대해서 그러면 그 중에서도 골라야 하는 이유가 있는데요 예를 들면 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 그리고 어드밴스드 머츄리얼 이렇게 4가지의 잡지가 있다고 생각을 해보시면 하이팩트 저널이 네이처와 사이언스는 인터 디스플로널이기 때문에 굉장히 브로드한 스콥 들을 많이 가지고 있습니다 논문들에서 바이오도 있구요 머츄리얼도 있구 요 케미스트리 도 있습니다 피직스 도 있고 굉장히 뭐 지올로지도 있구요 굉장히 넓은 전체 필드에 논문들을 모두 다 보여주고 있습니다 그래서 여러분들 가장 먼저는 Nature Science를 선택하실 수도 있습니다. 그렇지만 여러분들의 연구 결과가 Scope이 조금 Specific하다, 조금은 좁다 라는 생각이 들 수도 있으십니다. 그러면 Nature 보 다는 Nano를 연구하셨다면 Nano Technology를 선택을 하시게 되죠. 또는 재료를 하셨으면 Advanced Motoring이나 이런 논문들을 선택을 하시게 되는데 선택을 하시는 데 있어서 가장 먼저 하셔야 될 일은 후보들을 정하셨으면 그 논문에 Scope을 읽어보시기를 강력하게 권유 드립니다. 왜냐하면 어떤 논문들이든요. 자기 잡지에서 원하는 Scope이 있습니다. 근데 그 Scope과 맞지 않은 논문, 예를 들어서 Nano를 연구하셨는데 Nano 안에서 Nano 재료를 연구하셨는데 그 Nano 재료를 가지고 Photonics를 연구를 하셨습니다. 그렇지만 Nano 재료이기 때문에 Nature Nanotechnology를 갈 수도 있구요. Nature Photonics를 갈 수도 있습니다. 그렇지만 여러분들의 연구 결과에 가장 중요한 Significance가 뭔지를 생각을 해보시면 그 Scope에 맞는 Journal은 Nanotechnology 일 수도 있고, Photonics도 포토닉스 일 수도 있습니다. 그런 것처럼 여러분들은 이 잡지에 Scope을 항상 고민을 하시고 결정을 하시는 게 매우 중요합니다. 그래서 보내게 됩니다. 그리고 보내고 나서 Journal의 Response가 오고, Publishing 할 때까지의 결과가 어 Publishing이 되면 여러분들은 적절한 Paper를 Journal을 골랐다고 생각을 하실 수가 있게 되는 거죠. 이 긴 고난동안 여러분들이 고민을 해야 되는 점들이 몇 가지 있습니다만, 이런 것들은 굉장히 기술적이기 때문에 앞으로 계속 말씀을 드릴 겁니다. 그래서 먼저 저도 열심히 좋은 논문을 쓰기 위해서 노력하지만 여러분들하고 똑같이 그 방법 중에 가장 먼저 시간을 줄이기 위한 방법을 한번 말씀을 드려보도록 하겠습니다. 시간을 줄이기 위해서 보통 하는 방법들은 빨리 작성을 해서 빨리 투고한다 가 아닐 수도 있습니다. 어쩌면, 에디터가 각각의 잡지마다 에디터가 있는 이유는 여러분들의 논문을 받아서 읽어보고 리뷰를 보낼지, 리뷰 프로세스를 보낼지 고 민하는 기간이 있습니다. 이 기간이 보통은 2주에서부터 짧게는... 제가 경험하지만, 보통은 2주에서 2주가 되기 때문에, 그 기간이 길게 옵니다. 그래서 보통은 2주에서 2주까지가 되기 때문에, 그 기간을 좀 더 빨리 투고하자. 바로는 짧게는 하루 정도 24시간 정도 길게는 한 달 정도 이렇게 시간이 들어가는 기간이 있습니다 그래서 이 기간을 매우 줄이고 그리고 다음 단계로 빨리 넘어가게 하기 위한 방법이 하나가 있는데요 많은 분들이 하지는 않은 걸로 알고 있습니다만은 한번 학생 때부터 해보도록 권유를 드리고 싶은게 교수님들과 함께 논문을 투고 하기 전에 이 잡지에 내 논문을 먼저 보내 보는 겁니다 에디터에게만 에디터에게 보내서 이 잡지에 내 논문이 이 정도의 시그니피션트가 있기 때문에 무조건 뭐 퍼블리쉬가 돼야 될 이유가 있다 라고 한번 말을 전달을 해보는 거죠 내 생각이니까 상관은 없습니다 그 사람들은 에디터들은 받아들일 수도 있고요 아니면 무시할 수도 있고요 아니면 답장을 잘해서 여러분들이 다음달에 공부할 수 있는지에 대해서는 상관없습니다. 그래서 이 단계로 바로 넘어갈 수 있게 해 줄 수도 있습니다 근데 이렇게 좋은 연구 결과를 먼저 에디터들과 소통을 해서 프로세스를 조금 더 짧게 해 가는 과정들이 있고 이 과정이 만약에 좋다라고 하면 좋은 결과를 얻어서 리뷰 프로세스를 넘어갔다 라고 하면 제 개인적인 경험으로는 논문이 될 확률이 매우 높아집니다 그래서 프리섬미션에 프리섬미션에 인퀘이리를 항상 해보는 것도 굉장히 좋은 방법이기 때문에 이런 과정들은 꼭 해보시고 계시길 바랍니다. 그래서 이렇게 논문을 골라가는 과정들을 앞으로 조금 더 디테일하게 테크닉한 부분들에 대해서 다음 4화장에서 말씀을 드리도록 하겠습니다 그래서 이렇게 논문을 골라가는 과정들을 앞으로 조금 더 디테일하게 테크닉한 부분들에 대해서 다음 4 화장에서 말씀을 드리도록 하겠습니다 4주차 제목: Structure of an academic paper Storytelling method for academic papers Preparing for writing academic papers 내용: 5주차 제목: Types of publication and structure summary Title, Abstract 내용:

연구를 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을지 몇 가지 조언을 드리도록 하겠습니다. 이제 새로 대학원 생활을 시작하는 여러분들에게 도움이 될 중요한 내용들이니 잘 듣고 여러분들에게 도움을 주시기 바랍니다. 자, 강의 소개를 대학원 생활에 참고해 주시기를 바랍니다. 먼저 우리가 공부하고 연구하는 대상 분야라고 할 수 있는 과학, 사이언스와 공학, 엔지니어링에 대해 알아 봅시다. 위키피디아에 의하면 과학, 사이언스는 시험 가능한 설명과 예측의 형태로 우리가 사는 세상에 대한 지식을 구축하고 조직하는 체계를 말합니다. 또한 미국 공학인증원에 의하면 공학, 엔지니어링은 우리 인류의 이익을 위하여 자연 물질과 힘을 경제적으로 활용하기 위한 목적으로 연구, 경험과 실습 등을 통해 얻은 수학과 자연과학적 전문 지식 체계로 정의됩니다. 특히 공학의 경우에는 인류의 이익을 위하여 경제적으로 활용하기 위한 어떤 활용을 주목해 주시기 바랍니다. 때문에 공기역학 분야에서 널리 알려진 헝거릭의 미국인 수학자, 물리학자이자 항공우주 엔지니어였던 시어더 본 칼만은 과학자는 그것이 무엇인지 설명, 기술하고 공학자는 기존에 없던 무언가를 창조한다 라는 유명한 말을 남겼습니다. 이렇게 보면 존재하는 어떤 현상, 사물, 이론이나 설명을 분석, 설명하고, 새로운 사물이나 이론을 만들어 가는 것이 이제 여러분들에게 주어진 주요한 활동인 연구, 리서치라고 할 수 있겠습니다. 자, 그럼 연구자, 리서처는 어떤 사람이라고 할 수 있을까요? OECD에서 정의한 바에 따르면 연구자는 인간, 문화와 사회에 대한 지식을 발전시키고 새로운 응용을 구축하고, 문화와 사회에 대한 지식을 보완하기 위해 체계적으로 수행되는 창의적인 작업인 연구, 리서치를 수행하는 사람으로서 연구는 사실과 이전의 결과를 확인하고 새로운 문제나 기존 문제를 해결하며 어 떤 이론을 뒷받침하거나 새로운 이론을 개발하는 활동을 말합니다. 정리하면 연구는 사실의 확인이나 문제의 해결, 또는 이론의 개발을 모으거나, 이론의 개발을 목적으로 하며 이를 위한 체계적이며 창의적인 활동이라고 할 수 있습니다. 여러분들은 지금 이러한 연구에 첫 발을 내딛고 있는 것입니다. 대학원 생활을 통하여 여러분들은 이 런 연구에 대해서 배우고, 연구자로서 성장하게 될 것입니다. 자, 그럼 좋은 연구자가 되기 위하여 대학원에서 연구는 얻을 수 있을까요? 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까요? 여러분들의 성공적인 대학원 생활을 위한 조언을 말씀드리고자 하니 이 부분 잘 듣고 숙지하여 주시기 바랍니다. 첫 번째, 여러분들의 연구자로서의 생활은 오늘부터, 아니, 여러분들이 대학원에 진학하기로 결심한 순간부터 이미 시작되었습니다. 그냥 학생으로서가 아니라 연구자로서의 자세를 가지고 대학원 생활에 임하기를 권합니다. 굳이 여러분들 대학 시절의 생활과 대학원에서의 생활을 구별하고자 한다면 대학원에서는 여러분들이 처음부터 연구자로서 성장하기 위해서 연구에 대해서 배우고 익히는 부분이 있다는 부분으로 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 두 번째, 여러분들의 지도교수님은 여러분들의 선생님, 강사, 동료, 그리고 어쩌면 인생의 선배로서 매우 중요한 사람입니다. 두 번째, 여러분들의 지도교수님은 여러분들의 선생님, 강사, 동료, 그리고 어쩌면 인생의 선배로서 매우 중요한 사람입니다. 그러므로 교수님과 가능한 자주 만나고 지도교수님이 어떤 사람인지, 특히 교육과 연구에 대해 가지고 있는 지도교수님의 철학을 잘 파악하고 배우도록 하십시오. 마지막으로, 대부분의 교수님들은 열의가 있고 자기두조독인 학생을 좋아합니다. 교수님에게 다음에는 뭐를 할까요? 같은 질문을 하지 마시고, 여러분들의 아이디어나 계획, 설계나 솔루션을 먼저 해 주시기 바랍니다. 감사합니다. 교수님의 생각은 어떠십니까? 하고 물으시기 바랍니다. 교수님들에게는 스스로 고민하고 답을 찾아가려고 노력하는 학생들만큼 사랑스러운 학생은 없다는 사실 잊지 마시기 바랍니다. 교수님들에게는 스스로 고민하고 답을 찾아가려고 노력하는 학생들만큼 사랑스러운 학생은 없다는 사실 잊지 마시기 바랍니다. 또한, 말씀드린 것처럼 다음에는 뭐를 할까요? 라는 얘기를 하신 후에 어떠한 답이 올 때까지 아무 일도 하지 않고 고민 없이 시간을 보내는 학생들이 교수님이 보기에는 좀 편하다고 생각하시면 좋겠습니다. 또한, 말씀드린 것처럼 다음에는 뭐를 할까요? 라는 얘기를 하신 후에 Irrelative ii. 교수님의 비판과 견해를 낮추시기 바랍니다. 좋은 연구자가 되기 위한 대학원에서의 연구에 대해 여섯 가지 제안을 이 페이지에서 소개드리고 싶습니다. 첫 번째, 여러분들의 연구와 논문 작성을 가능한 빨리, 바로 지금 시작하십시오. 내가 아직 부족한데 내가 아직 배운 것이 없으니, 내가 아직 논문 쓸 준비가 되지 않았어, 이런 생각은 들으세요. 이렇게 말하시면 좋겠습니다. 이렇게 말하시면 좋 겠습니다. 지금 현재 알고 있고 현재까지 생각하고 있는 것들도 간단하게라도 논문 형태로 정리해보는 습관이 중요합니다. 둘째, 좋은 연구 문제를 찾아 선택하십시오. 사실 연구와 논문에 있어서 가장 중요한 부분 중에 하나가 연구 문제, 주제에 대한 것이 되겠습니다. 연구의 대상이 되는 연구 문제의 선정은 대단히 중요합니다. 때문에 각 분야에서 중요한 문제를 선택하되 어디서나 새로운 문제를 찾아보도록 하십시오. 또한 각 분야의 현재 문제들과 핫한 인기 주제들을 지속적으로 조사하여 파악하는 것이 매우 중요합니다. 각자 연구 분야의 리뷰 페이퍼에 주의를 기울이시기 바랍니다. 리뷰 페이퍼는 각 분야의 석학들이 해당 연구 분야의 최신 동향이나 연구 분야의 최신 동향이나 연구 분야의 최신 동향을 지적하는 것입니다. 리뷰 페이퍼는 각 분야의 다양한 이론과 이론 등을 종합적으로 분석하고 그동안의 연구 히스토리와 앞으로의 어떤 방향으로 연구를 진행하면 좋을지에 대한 예측과 재현을 담은 논문입니다. 리뷰 페이퍼는 각 분야의 다양한 이론과 기존 연구 사례들을 주제별로 정리하고 있기 때문에 해당 분야를 이해하고 조망하는 데 큰 도움을 줍니다. 때문에 여러분들이 해당된 어떤 특정한 주제나 연구 문제를 결정하시게 되면 해당된 연구 주제에 대한 리뷰 페이퍼 가능하면 가장 최근에 만들어진 리뷰 페이퍼를 찾아서 먼저 읽어보시기를 권해드립니다. 리뷰 페이퍼는 최근의 어떤 동향뿐이 아니라 과거의 히스토리 그러니까 이 주제 에 대해서 예전에는 어떠한 시각으로 어떤 문제들을 찾아서 풀어 나왔는지 또 어떤 연구자들은 어떤 측면의 연구를 진행하였는데 그 관계는 무엇이었는지 또 다른 연구자는 이를 극복하기 위해서 어떠한 노력을 했고 그 결과는 어디까지 진행되었는지 한마디로 현재까지 해당된 주제와 연구 문제에 대한 연구의 진행 상황을 조망할 수 있도록 해주고요. 리뷰 페이퍼 끝부분에는 리뷰 페이퍼를 작성한 연구자의 재현 그러니까 해당된 문제에 대해서 현재까지의 진행된 상황이 이러하니 앞으로는 어떠한 방향이 유망하고고 어떠한 방향의 연구, 어떠한 부분에 대한 노력이 필요하다 같은 것들을 재현하게 됩니다. 그러한 재현이나 정리가 여러분들이 연구 주제에 대해서 이해를 하고 앞으로 어떤 방향으로 아이디어를 펴나가는 것이 좋을지에 대한 결정을 하는데 상당히 큰 도움을 주게 됩니다. 때문에 해당된 분에 대한 리뷰 페이퍼를 먼저 찾아서 읽으시기를 권해드립니다. 자, 세 번째는 효율적인 연구를 위한 가이드라인입니다. 통상 우리가 연구를 할 때 이 문제에 대한 또는 이 주제에 대한 해답, 솔루션이 뭔지에 대 해서 집중해서 생각을 하시는데요. 사실은 해답 솔루션에 대한 생각 전에 이 문제는 도대체 어떤 문제인지 이 문제의 성격은 무엇이고 이 문제가 왜 어렵고 또 어떤 측면에서 바라봐야 되는지 그 문제 자체에 대한 정보를 알아보야 하는 것입니다. 하지만 저희가 수 Professor가 되는 학 WiFi Convertersicio는 lithium 그리고 knots.healR.com activities를 keepshift wayскихuter.com를 굉장히 ?\\"noo.Hey, Try english.jep protocols.html?\\"로 주문하시는 만큼 이렇게 적خ하고 발표할 시간을 어떻게 Bengalize思에서나 etc.human 방해받지 않는 시간을 많이 확보하시기를 권해드립니다. 예를 들면 아침에 일찍 연구실에 나와서 8시부터 10시까지 방해받지 않고 연구에 집중할 수 있는 시간을 정하고 일을 실행하시기 바랍니다. 여러분들 이제 대학원 생활을 시작하시게 되면 연구실 상황에 따라 다르겠습니다만 대개의 경우에 연구실에서 굉장히 많은 일들이 있습니다. 또 연구실의 선배, 후배, 교수님과 같이 진행하는 연구라든지 회의라든지 그런 부분들이 많이 있기 때문에 여러분들이 조용히 여러분들 책상에 앉 아서 말씀드린 것처럼 이 문제는 과연 어떤 문제인가에 대한 숙고를 하거나 어떤 리서치에 집중할 수 있는 여러분들 혼자만 집중할 수 있는 시간이 생각보다 많지 않을 수 있습니다. 때문에 여러분들이 처음에 연구실에 나가시게 되면 연구실에 나가시게 되면 연구실에 나가시게 되면 연구실에서 진행되는 상황을 먼저 보신 후에 여기 말씀드린 것처럼 예를 들면 1시간 먼저 나와서 연구실이 보통 9시나 10시부터 여러가지 회의라든지 세미나라든지 이런 것이 진행된다고 하면 한 8시나 9시, 1시간 정도쯤에 나와서 여러분들만의 시간을 갖고 그 시간에 수업시간에 들은 내용들에 대한 숙제라든지 과제 같은 걸 하실 수도 있고 아니면 여러분들이 지금 관심을 가지고 있는 것 같은 것들에 대한 숙제라든지 아니면 여러분들이 지금 관심을 가지고 있는 것 같은 것 같은 것들을 리서치 문제나 진행 과정에 대해서 스스로 한번 돌아보시고 숙고할 수 있는 그런 시간으로 활용하시라는 말씀이 되겠습니다. 한 가지 추가로 말씀드린다고 하면 특히 이공계에서는 연구실 생활이 혼자 있는 것이 아니고 약간 단체 생활 비슷하게 동료들과 함께 진행되기 때문에 예를 들어서 여러분들이 나는 8시에 나와서 1시간 정도는 나의 시간을 갖겠다. 경우에 연구실에 동료들에게 또는 선배들에게 그 부분을 얘기를 하고 미리 양해를 받아 놓으시는 것이 좋습니다 예를 들어서 나는 매일 8시부터 9시까지는 제가 한번 공부하는데 집중할 시간을 가지고자 하니 8시부터 9시까지는 방해하지 말아 주십시오 이런 말씀이죠 그런 식으로 본인 혼자 자기의 관심 분야에 집중할 수 있는 그런 시간을 확보하시면 좋을 것 같습니다 제가 이렇게 자꾸 아침에 8시부터 9시 이렇게 말씀을 드리는 이유는 저녁으로 잡을 수도 있겠죠 예를 들어서 일과 시간 5시나 6시가 끝난다고 하면 일과 시간 끝난 다음에 저녁식사하고 7시나 8시부터 나는 시간을 갖겠다 이렇게 정하실 수도 있겠죠 그런데 실제로 생활을 해보시면 대학원에서 저녁 이후에 시간은 또 랩에서 세미나도 하고 여러가지 회의도 잡고 그런 일이 많이 일어나는게 좋습니다. 왜냐하면 낮에 진행을 하다가 시간이 좀 모자라게 되면 자연스럽게 저녁 먹고 하자, 오늘 밤에 하자 하는 식으로 이어질 수가 있겠죠 그 래서 제 생각에는 가능하시면 하루에 시작이 되는 아침 아침에 이런 시간을 잡으면 좋지 않을까 생각이 됩니다 밤 늦게 잡겠다 하실 수도 있겠지만 밤에는 휴식을 하셔야 되겠죠 그래서 가능하면 아침이 좋지 않을까 권해드립니다 또 연구를 할 때는 언제 더 깊게 해당 주제에 대해서 솔루션에 대해서 깊게 파고 들어갈지 어느 부분에서는 깊게 집중하는 것보다 적용하는 영역이나 분야를 더 넓게 확장해 나갈지 어떤 것들은 이 문제와 같이 볼지 어떤 것들은 별도로 볼지 이런 것들을 고려하도록 하십시오 이렇게 해당된 문제를 바라보는 여러 가지 시각이나 그 문제의 범위 그 다음에 방법에 대해서 그때 그때 결정을 해서 집중을 하셔야 되는데 이러한 과정에서 여러분들의 지도 교수님과 또는 선배, 같이 일하는 연구 동료들과 해당된 부분에 대한 토론과 논의를 거쳐서 이 부분을 결정하여 진행하시면 되겠습니다 또 여러분들이 어떤 분야에 대해서 리뷰 페이퍼나 해당된 분야를 공부하시게 되면 항상 현재까지의 Current State가 있습니다 특히 현재 상태의 문제 솔루션에 대해서 그들이 갖고 있는 가정에 대한 어떤 도전적인 질문을 통하여 새로운 솔루션을 찾아가실 수 있습니다 예를 들면 기존의 논문이나 기존의 솔루션은 입력이 동일하다고 가정하고 문제를 풀었다고 하면 여러분들은 한번 그것이 꼭 동일해야 되는가 그것이 다르다고 했을 때는 어떤 문제가 벌어지는가로 한번 도전을 해보시면 왜 그 가정을 통해서 문제를 풀 수밖에 없었는지 또 그 가정을 풀었을 때는 어떠한 양태가 벌어지고 거기에서 여러분들이 어떤 부분들을 찾고 공부할 수 있을지를 할 수 있겠습니다 그러므로 가능하시면 기존에 어떤 정해져 있는 이 문제는 여기까지야, 이 문제는 이런 가정으로 풀었어 라는 부분을 숙지하신 이후에는 한번 그러한 기존의 가정이나 기존의 전제를 한번 풀고 한번 나는 가정을 바꿔서 또는 기존의 전제를 넘어서서 한번 해보겠다 하는 식으로 도전을 해보시는 과정을 통해서 보다 새로운 그런 연구 결과와 솔루션이 찾아질 수 있다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 아울러 해당된 연구 문제는 간단한 문제도 있겠지만 대부분의 경우에 여러 가지 측면에 여러 가지 문제들을 다루고 있는 복잡한 문제들이 일반적입니다 그래서 그 런 문제를 다루기 용이하도록 가능하시면 여러 개로 나누어 접근하여 해결하시는 게 좋겠습니다 물론 말씀드린 것처럼 여러 개의 문제로 나눌 때 여러분의 지도교수님이나 동료, 선배들과 논의와 협의를 거쳐서 적절하게 문제를 나누고 해당된 문제를 담당하시게 되겠습니다 또 다른 연구자들에게 여러분들의 아이디어나 솔루션을 시현하는 방법도 매우 중요합니다 그래서 이러한 시현안은 어떻게 여러분들에게 여러분들의 연구 과정이나 솔루션이나 결과를 다른 사람들에게 어떻게 보여줄지도 같이 고민하면서 연구를 진행하시는 것이 중요하다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 또한 자신만의 단기, 장기 연구목표를 수립하여 연구를 진행하도록 하고 이 과정에서 다른 연구자들과 활발 하게 의사소통 하시기를 권합니다 유명한 이야기로 만약 엔지니어가 되고 싶다면 다른 사람들과 연구하는 것이 좋습니다 또 다른 사람들과 협력하라 라는 말이 있습니다 자신의 연구 문제, 접근 방법, 해결하기 어려운 부분 현재의 결과와 향후 계획 등을 지도교수님은 물론 연구실 동료들 그리고 해당 분야의 여러 연구자들과 커뮤니케이션 하여 서로 논의하고 협력해 나가기를 바라며 연구 논문 작성도 커뮤니케이션의 일환으로 생각하시기 바랍니다 연구자들 사이의 상호 협력이야말로 과학기술과 연구의 협력을 이루는 것입니다 연구자들 사이의 상호 협력이야말로 과학기술과 연구의 협력을 이루는 것입니다 연구자들 사이의 상호 협력이야말로 과학기술과 연구의 협력을 이루 는 것입니다 여러분들이 작성하시는 연구 논문도 만약에 커뮤니케이션의 일환으로 생각하신다면 연구논문에서 여러분들이 굉장히 어려운 문제를 어렵게 풀어서 얘기하는 것보다는 말씀드린 바와 같이 그 문제를 가능하실 게 여러분들이 어떤 방법으로 어떤 어프로치로 적용해서 어떤 결과를 얻었는지 다른 사람들에게 잘 보이고 설명할 수 있는 부분도 매우 중요합니다 설명할 수 있는 부분도 매우 중요합니다 중요한 부분이라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 이러한 측면에서 네 번째 조안은 여러분들의 연구를 논문 등을 통하여 활발하게 출판, 퍼블리시하라는 것입니다. 항상 여러분들 연구하는 과정에서 연구 내용을 어떤 저널에 퍼블리시할지를 생각하십시오. 이때 논문을 낼 때 공동 저자는 그 사람이 어떠한 공헌이 있다면 가능한 넓고 관대하게 결정하도록 하고 대신 저자의 순서는 신중하게 결정하시기를 바랍니다. 여러분들의 논문 작성에 가능한 많은 사람들이 협동할 수 있기를 바랍니다. 논문을 작성할 때는 잘 구성하여 읽기 쉽고 독자들이 흥미롭게 작성하도록 하고 여러분들의 연구실, 조직에서만 사용하는 자 체 용어를 사용하거나 퍼준 표기법에 어긋나지 않도록 주의하실 필요가 있습니다. 또한 여러분들의 연구에 관련된 기존 연구들을 충분하게 포함시키고 정리하여 제시함으로써 독자들에게 여러분들 연구 주제의 중요성과 연구 방법의 타당성을 설명할 수 있고 다양한 방법으로 퍼블리시하기를 권합니다. 예를 들어 학술 저널에 논문을 게재하 는 것뿐이 아니라 국내외 학술 대회에서 논문을 발표하기도 하시고 기사 형태로 기구하거나 특허 문서를 작성하는 등 해당된 주제에 여러분들의 연구에 관한 내용을 작성하시기 바랍니다. 여러분들의 아이디어, 여러분들의 연구 과정, 연구 결과를 여러 가지 다양한 형태로 적극적으로 발표하시기를 권해드립니다. 다섯 번째는 연구의 일관성에 관련된 것입니다. 여러분들의 연구 분야는 대학원에 입학하여 연구실에 오면서 어느 정도는 정해졌다고 할 수 있으며 공부를 계속하면서 점차 구체적인 세부 분야로 깊이 있게 들어가게 될 것입니다. 여러분들의 연교분야와 주요한 연구문제들을 지속적으로 탐색-계발하고 확장해 나가십시오. 이때 특히 논쟁의 여지가 있는 영역에서 긍정적으로 연구하시길 바랍니다. 왜냐면 논쟁의 여지가 있는 분야와 문제는 다른 측면에서는 여러분들에게 아주 큰 성과를 가져올 수 있는 기회가 될 수도 있기 때문입니다. 마지막 여섯 번째는 다른 사람들과 적극적으로 투자할 수 있는 문제입니다. 다시 한번 연구하시기 바랍니다. 자, 마지막 여섯 번째는 다른 사람들과 적극적으로 투자할 수 있는 문제입니다. 자, 마지막 여섯 번째는 다른 사람들과 적극적으로 투자할 수 있는 문제입니다. 활발하게 협동하라는 것입니다. 여러분들이 먼저 좋은 종료가 되어 주변의 좋은 동료들을 만들어 나가십시오. 동료들과 서로 연구 논문 출판을 격려하고 가능하면 논문을 효율적으로 작성하기 위한 협력척의 일종의 버디 시스템을 만들어 운영하도록 하십시오. 특히 작성된 논문의 교정이나 검토에서 서로 상대방의 논문을 봐주는 연구실 동료들과의 버디 시스템은 매우 효과적입니다. 또한 논문의 계제 승인이나 수상 등 어떠한 성취가 있을 경우 동료들과 함께 크게 축하하도록 하고 또 여러분들 스스로에게도 어떤 성취가 있을 때마다 관대한 보상을 하기를 바랍니다. 아울러 여러분들 주변에 연구와 논문 작성을 응원하고 도움을 주는 분위기와 환경을 만들고 지속적으로 유지해 나가시기를 바랍니다. 이러한 분위기와 환경을 만들고 유지하기 위해서 여러분들 연구실의 동료들과 또 지도교수님과 같이 의논하고 필요한 부분이 있다면 건의하여 보다 연구를 잘 수행할 수 있는 편안한 그런 연구실 환경을 만들어 나 가시기를 권해드립니다. 다음으로 학술 논문을 효과적으로 작성하기 위한 가이드라인을 소개해드리고자 합니다. 논문을 작성할 때는 바로 글쓰기에 덤벼들지 말고 먼저 글의 주제와 범위, 구조에 대한 생각과 구상을 하고 이에 기반하여 계획하고 정리하도록 합니다. 이후 이를 기반으로 개요, 아웃라인을 먼저 작성해보기를 권합니다. 또 글을 작성할 때는 지루한 구조를 피하고 가능한 간결하고 명료하게 설명 표현하도록 노력하고 독자가 정해졌다면 대상 독자들이 익숙하고 좋아하는 스타일로 논문을 작성하시기 바랍니다. 또한 속어, 유행어, 반복적이거나 완곡한 표현, 절자법과 문법 오류를 피하도록 최대한 노력할 필요가 있습니다. 이번 강의의 마지막으로 좋은 논문을 작 성하고 퍼블리시게 하기 위한 8가지 팁을 소개해드리고자 합니다. 먼저 좋은 논문을 작성하고 싶다면 논문을 많이, 가능하면 좋은 논문을 많이 읽으십시오. 보다 넓은 범위로 확장해 나가기 위해서는 연구 분야뿐이 아니라 연구 분야가 많아지지 않으면 연구 분야가 많아지지 않으면 연구 분야뿐이 아니라 연구 분야가 많아지지 않으면 연구 분야가 많아지지 않으면 영어 분야가 아닌 부분에 대해서도 폭넓게 논문을 읽는 것이 좋습니다. 또한 스스로의 연구나 논문에 대하여 가능한 객관적이 되도록 하십시오. 자신의 연구 문제와 연구 방법, 결과 등을 제3자의 시각에서 가능한 객관적으로 살펴보고 작성한 논문을 보고 수정하는 것이 필요합니다. 다음, 영어 논문 작성 시에는 좋은 영어를 사용하여 하며 가능한 전문적인 논문을 읽는 것이 좋습니다. 가능한 전문적인 영어 교정을 받으시길 바랍니다. 네번째, 조금 슬픈 이야기지만 연구자들은 게재 거부, 보통 리젝션이라고 하죠. 그와 함께 사는 법을 배워야 합니다. 연구자로서의 모든 경력은 사실 여러 가지 논문을 작성해서 제출하고 또 거절되는 과정과 함께 한다고 보시면 되겠습니다. 그러나 게재 거절로 해당된 논문이 끝났다고 생각하실 필요는 없습니다. 그러나 게재 거절로 해당된 논문이 끝났다고 생각하실 필요는 없습니다. 그러나 게재 거절로 해당된 논문이 끝났다고 생각하실 필요는 없습니다. 심사자들에게 좋은 조언을 받았다고 생각하시고 그 심사자들의 의견을 바탕으로 논문을 더 좋게 수정 보완하여 좋은 결과를 얻을 수 있겠습니다. 그러므로 논문의 게재 거절은 아픈 경험이긴 하지만 좋은 결과를 위해 거쳐가는 일상적인 과정으로 생각하고 받아들이시길 바랍니다. 아울러 많은 경우에 연구가 끝난 후 이제 논문을 쓰자 하는 경우가 많은데 연구가 끝나기 전, 아니 연구의 전 과정에서 나중에 결과를 얻어지면 논문을 어떻게 구성하고 작성할지를 계속 염두에 두어야 합니다. 즉, 필요하면 연구의 진행과정이나 범위도 논문 작성을 고려하여 정해져야 한다는 것을 잊지 마시기 바랍니다. 좋은 논문을 작성하기 위해서는 스스로 심사자, 리뷰어가 되어 보십시오. 연구나 논문을 비판적으로 평가하는 방법에 익숙해지는 것은 자신의 연구나 논문을 개꽃으로 작성하 는 것입니다. 자신의 연구나 논문을 개꽃으로 작성하는 것입니다. 자신의 연구나 논문을 개꽃으로 작성하는 것입니다. 객관적으로 3자의 시각에서 평가하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 또한, 가능한 일찍 논문을 어떤 저널에 제출할지 정하시는 것이 좋습니다. 이때 기본적으로는 각 저널의 홈페이지에서 모포 및 범위를 살펴보십시오. 이를 통해서 해당 저널에 여러분들의 논문을 게재하는 데 필요한 내용이나 범위나 주제를 결정할 수 있으며, 이를 기반으로 연구를 구체화하고 필요한 내용과 결과를 정할 수 있습니다. 이를 기반으로 연구를 구체화하고 필요한 내용과 결과를 정할 수 있습니다. 마지막으로, 좋은 논문이라면 그 논문의 품질이 제일 중요합니다. 가능한 좋은 저널에 좋은 논문을 준비해서 내도록 하고, 계속적으로 더 좋은 논문을 작성하고 더 좋은 저널에 낼 수 있도록 도전하시기를 바랍니다. 이상으로 논문 작성법 및 연구윤리 과목의 첫 번째 강의를 마칩니다. 이번 강의에서는 전반적인 강의 소개와 함께 대학원 학생으로서 연구와 논문 작성이 어떤 의미이고 어떤 마음가짐과 자세가 필요한지를 설명드렸 습니다. 경청해 주셔서 감사합니다. 2주차 제목: Effective process for writing good academic papers 내용: 안녕하세요. 공과대학 산업공학과 노상도 교수입니다. 오늘은 논문 작성빈 연구윤리 과목의 두 번째 강의로서 좋은 학술 논문을 작성하기 위한 효과적인 절차, 작성 프로세스에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 이번 강의의 내용은 수잔 스티븐슨과 스티브 비트모어가 2002년 출판한 엔지니어링 커뮤니케이션의 전략과 2009년 제가 우리 대학의 여러 교수님들과 함께 출판한 과학기술 커뮤니케이션에 있는 일부 내용을 발췌해 정리한 것임을 말씀드립니다. 혹시 오늘의 강의에 대해서 더 관심이 있는 분은 이 두 권의 책을 참고해 주시기 바랍니다. 자, 먼저 좋은 학술 논문을 작성하기 위한 효과적인 방법과 절차에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 일반적으로 학술 논문 작성은 계획, 플래닝 단계, 구상 및 준비, 인벤팅 단계, 초고 작성, 드래프팅, 그리고 교정과 최종편집, 리바이징 앤 에디팅의 단계로 진행됩니다. 교정과 최종편집, 리바이징 앤 에디팅의 단계로 진행됩니다. 교정과 최종편집, 리바이징 앤 에디팅의 단계로 진행됩니다. 계획 단계에서는 논문 작성 일정을 수립하고 독자를 정의하고 분석하여 논문의 목적을 정합니다. 계획 단계에서는 논문 작성일정을 수립하고 독자를 정의하고 분석하여 논문의 목적을 정합니다. 계획 단계에서는 논문 작성일정을 수립하고 독자를 정의하고 분석하여 논문의 목적을 정합니다. 계획 단계에서는 논문 작성일정을 수립하고 독자를 정의하고 분석하여 논문의 목적을 정합니다. 사실 논문의 목적을 정하는데 있어서 제일 중요한 부분 중의 하나는 사실 논문의 목적을 정하는데 있어서 제일 중요한 부분 중의 하나는 부분 중의 하나가 내가 작성하는 논문을 읽을 독자가 어떤 사람인지를 정의하고 분석하는 것이 제일 중요한 부분 중의 하나라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 다음, 구상 및 준비 단계에서는 이 논문을 작성하고 어떤 내용을 담을 건지에 대한 아이디어를 구상하고 논문 작성 작업을 준비합니다. 초고 작성 단계에서는 초고, draft죠. 초고를 효율적으로 작성하고 이때 글쓰기에 장애 요인들에 대한 대처가 필요하겠습니다. 마지막으로 교정 및 최종 편집 단계에서는 처음 초고 단계에서 작성된 초고를 꼼꼼하게 교정하고 문법 오류와 오자를 확인합니다. 이 단계에서는 지루함과 완벽주기에 대한 효과적인 대처가 필요하다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 지금 말씀드린 글쓰기의 장애 요인에 대한 대처 방법, 또 지루함과 완벽주의의요인, 이 단계에 대해서는 이후에 자세히 설명드리도록 하겠습니다. 학술 논문 작성은 말씀드린 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 그리고 교정이 순서대로 이루어지게 되는데요. 이것이 한 번에 이루어 지는 것이 아니라 이 세 가지 단계가 여러 차례 상호적으로 서로 영향을 받으며 수행되는 반복적이고 재규적인 과정이라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 아래의 편은 재미난 조사 결과를 보여주고 있는데요. 숙론되지 않은 저자, 글을 그렇게 비효율적으로 썩 만족스럽지 않게 논문을 작성하는 저자의 경우에는 전체 논문 작성 시간의 50% 정도를 구상 및 준비 작업에 나머지 시간 중 45%를 초고 작성을 위해 보내고 최종 교정 단계에서는 5% 남짓의 시간을 사용한다고 합니다. 최종 마무리입니다. 최종 마무리를 통해 논문의 완성도를 높일 수 있는 교정 단계에 매우 적은 시간만을 투입하기 때문에 전반적인 논문의 완성도가 높지 않게 될 위험이 큽니다. 이 부분을 한 번 살펴보면 어떤 논문을 작성하는데 내가 시간이 열흘이 있다고 봤을 때 5일 정도는 논문을 어떻게 쓸까 구상을 하고 나머지 4일 반 정도는 글을 쓰는데 보낸 다음에 그러고 보니까 반나절밖에 시간이 안 남은 거죠. 그러니까 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 반나절도가 안 남습니다. 그래서 초고를 작성하고 막 헐레벌떡 교정까지 작성해서 제출하게 됩니다. 결과적으로 글을 작성하는 프로세스 전반도 비효율적일 뿐이 아니라 최종 결과물도 그렇게 높은 수준으로 다듬어지지 못하는 그런 결과를 얻게 된다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 일반적인 이야기입니다. 반면에 숙련된 저자는 표 밑에 있는 부분에서처럼 논문 작성 시간의 25%를 받을 수 있습니다. 반면에 숙련된 저자는 표 밑에 있는 부분에서처럼 논문 작성 시간의 25%를 받을 수 있습니다. 그러니까 한 2일 정도를 구상 및 준비. 그러니까 한 2일 정도를 구상 및 준비에 쓴 다음에 35% 정도를 초고 작성 단계에 투입을 합니다. 그러니까 한 3, 4일 정도를 초고 작성에 투입을 해서 결국엔 60% 정도. 그러니까 전체가 열흘이라고 하면 한 6일 정도까지 초고 작성을 완료한 후에 나머지 40% 시간. 그러니까 어느 정도는 상대적으로 충분히 긴 시간을 최종적인 교정. 그러니까 작성된 드래프트를 보고. 수정하고 꼼꼼하게 오류를 찾고 더 낮게 인프로브하는 그런 시간에 40%를 투여한다는 이야기가 되겠습니다. 교정 및 마무리에 충분한 시간을 투입하기 때문에 논문의 최종 완성도를 높일 수가 있겠습니다. 또 구상 및 준비 단계에서 25%의 미만을 투입을 한다고 했는데 구상 및 준비 단계에서 25% 만에 투 입을 하려면 사실은 어떻게 해야 될까요? 이 이야기는 25%만에 투입을 하려면 어떻게 해야 될까요? 이 이야기는 25%만에 투입을 하려면 어떻게 해야 될까요? 우리가 무엇을 manera까. 우리가 전 시간에 말씀드린 것처럼 우리가 연구를 하는 과정에서 미리 지속적으로 내가 이 결과를, 연구 진행되는 과정에서 내가 지금 하고 있는 이 연구를 나중에 scares여� unjust. 우리가 전 시간에 말씀드린 것처럼 우리가 연구를 하는 과정에서 미리 지속적으로 내가 이 결과를, 연구 진행되는 과정에서 내가 지금 하고 있는 이 연구를 나중에 settled 될 때 don 지금 하고 있는 이 lieutenant 연구 진행되는 과정에서 내가 지금 하고 있는 이 lieutenant 방충행이 café 찍을 때는 논문을 어 떤 내용으로 어떻게 쓰겠다 이런 논문에 대한 아이디어를 지금 하고 있는 causes to be due to excuse purpose 지속적으로 구상하고 있다는 의미를 가지기도 합니다 그러니까 어찌보면 약간 좀 능숙한 논문을 잘 쓰는 연구자들은 평소에도 도 sonra는OL 논문을 잘 쓰는 연구자들은 평소부터 머릿속에 계속 연구를 하는 과정에서도 논문을 어 떻게 써야지 이런 결과가 나온다고 하면 어느 저널에 어떤 어떻게 해서 논문을 써야겠다 하는 생각을 머릿속에 계속 담고 있다가 이제 논문을 쓰자고 했을 때 빨리 드래프트를 완성한 다음에 충분한 시간을 가지고 꼼꼼하게 수정을 혼자 할 수도 있겠습니다만 동료들과 함께 여러 단계의 수정작업에 충분한 시간을 투여하는 그런 사람이라고 볼 수 있겠고요 상대적으로 조금 과장해서 말씀드리면 논문을 좀 이렇게 불편하고 비효율적으로 쓰는 친구들은 평소에 논문에 대해서 큰 고민을 하고 있지 않다가 자 이제 논문을 쓰자 하면 그제서야 어떤 논문을 어디에 쓰지 고민을 하다 보니 구상 및 준비 단계에 시간도 많이 걸리고 그러다 보니까 시간이 쫓겨져서 초고작성을 하다 보니 그 시간을 하고 보면 그 드래프트를 더 다듬고 수정할 때 쓸 시간이 며칠 안 남은 거예요 그러다 보니까 논문의 퀄리티가 높지 않게 되는 그렇다라는 말씀입니다 한마디로 논문 작성에 대해서 여러분들이 주어진 시간을 가능한 앞쪽에서 좀 빨리 수명을 하고 뒤쪽에서 좀 여유 시간을 확보해서 논문의 완성도를 최대로 높이는 방향으로 여러 분들의 시간을 사용하는 것이 바람직하다 이런 말씀이 되겠습니다 자 각각의 논문 작성 단계에 대해서 어떤 것이고 어떻게 하는 것이 효율적인 건지 한번 살펴보도록 하겠습니다 첫 번째는 계획 단계입니다 성공적인 논문 작성자는 말씀드린 대로 가능한 빨리 계획을 수립을 하는데 논문 작성을 결정하자마자 바로 시작하고 가능한 여러 개의 작업을 나누며 연구를 완료하기 전부터 논문 작성을 위한 중요한 작업들을 시작합니다 말씀드린 것처럼 평소에 연구를 하는 과정에서도 논문을 쓸 때 예를 들면 이 그래프를 이런 그래프를 이런 형태로 넣어야지 하면 그 그래프를 미리 가지고 있는 사람이라는 말씀이죠 또한 좋은 논문 작성을 위해서는 논문을 읽을 독자가 어떤 사람이 있 는지를 묻고 파악을 하며 작성할 논문의 목적을 명확하게 결정하게 됩니다 논문을 작성할 때 글의 독자와 이 독자에 따라 결정되는 목적을 정하는 것은 매우 중요하다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 왜냐하면 논문의 독자가 어떤 사람인지 그들의 전문성과 해당 주제에 대한 이해도 호감 등을 사전에 파악함으로써 작성할 논문의 목적을 더 정확 하게 정할 수 있기 때문입니다 이 페이지는 독자 분석을 위해 사용되는 여러 가지 질문들을 보여줍니다 여러분들의 글을 읽을 사람은 어떤 사람인지에 따라서 여러분들의 글을 읽을 사람은 어떤 사람인지에 따라서 기술적으로 전문가들, 관리자 또는 사업가가 어떤 사람들인지 기술적으로 전문가들, 관리자 또는 사업가가 어떤 사람들인지 또 그들이 왜 여러분들의 논문을 읽을 것인지 그들이 여러분들에게 논문 작성을 의뢰한 동기는 무엇인지 만약에 여러분들이 작성한 논문을 독자들이 봤을 때 그들이 여러분들이 작성한 논문의 제목이나 초록을 보고 관심을 가져서 볼 텐데 어떤 부분에 관심이 있겠느냐 하는 그런 이야기죠 여러분들의 논문을 바탕으로 그들이 어떤 행동을 취하게 될 건지 그들은 어떤 정보를 알고 싶을지 그런 부분들에 대해서 한번 생각해 보는 것이 필요하겠습니다 독자들이 주제에 대해 얼마나 잘 알고 있는지 또 얼마나 많은 배경 지식과 정보를 필요로 하는지 독자들이 여러분들이 사용하는 기술 용어에 대해서 익숙한지 독자들이 어떤 정보를 필요로 하고 여러분들이 그들의 요구를 해결하는데 필요한 정보들을 얼마나 어떤 형태로 가지고 있는지 필요한 정보들을 얼마나 어떤 형태로 가지고 있는지 필요한 정보를 가지고 있는지 만약에 그렇지 않다면 여러분들이 어떤 것을 좀 찾아야 되고 어떤 형태로 어떤 내용들을 정리해서 제시해야 될지 어떤 내용들을 듣고 어떤 내용들을 빼야 될지 이런 것들이 독자들이 여러분들이 작성한 논 문을 읽으면서 어떤 부분에 대해서 궁금하고 필요로 할지에 따라서 결정된다는 부분을 강조해서 말씀드리고 싶습니다 다음은 논문의 목적을 정하기 위한 과정에서 사용되는 질문들입니다 이 논문을 통해서 여러분은 무엇을 얻고 싶습니까? 논문의 목적을 명확하고 간결하게 기술할 수 있을지 기술하시길 권해드리고요 논문의 목표가 독자들의 기대와 어떤 관련이 있는지 독자들의 여러분들의 목표를 공유하고 있는지 그러니까 독자들이 여러분들의 논문을 보면서 갖는 기대나 목적과 여러분들이 논문을 통해서 독자들에게 전하고 싶은 이야기와 제시하고 싶은 내용이 일치해야 된다는 말씀이죠 그래서 그런 목표가 어느 정도 잘 맞는 건지 그렇지 않다면 일치하지 않는 부분이 뭔지 를 한번 따져보실 필요가 있습니다 결국엔 여러분들의 목표와 독자들의 기대를 모두 충족시킬 수 있는 방법이 무엇일지를 생각하시고요 독자들이 무엇을 알고 무엇을 모르는지 여러분들은 어떻게 그것을 또 판단할 수 있는지 논문에서 고려해야 할 태도나 가치에는 어떤 것들이 있는지를 여러분들이 한번 스스로 생각해 보시고 생각해 보시고 생각해 보시고 하실 필요가 있습니다 이러한 질문들을 무슨 시험 보듯이 각각의 질문에 대해서 답을 해 보는 형태라기 보다는 일종의 체크리스트처럼 여러분들이 이 질문들을 쭉 보면서 여러분들이 독자를 분석하고 목적을 결정하는 데 있어서 일종의 가이드라인처럼 활용을 하시면 좋다고 생각이 됩니다 아울러 계획 단계에서 좋은 글쓰기 환경을 준비해서 확보하는 것이 좋습니다 제가 지난 시간에 여러분 연구실에서 스스로 조용하게 집중해서 할 수 있는 그런 시간을 만들라고 말씀드렸는데요 글쓰기도 마찬가지입니다 글쓰기를 하고 있는데 주변에서 다른 방해나 이런 부분들이 있으면 가뜩이나 글 쓰는 게 어려운데 골치 아픈데 쉽지 않겠죠 그래서 가능하면 조용하고 방해받지 않을 수 있고요 중단 없이 논문 작성 작업을 진행할 수 있는 자신만의 글쓰기 환경을 구상하시는 게 필요합니다 이때 글은 한 번씩 읽어보시고 글쓰기 환경을 구상하시는 게 필요합니다 이때 글은 한 번씩 읽어보시고 글쓰기 환경을 구상하시는 게 필요합니다 글쓰기는 아무래도 컴퓨터 모니터를 보면서 쓰시기 때문에 조명이라든지 그런 부분에 신경을 쓰고 신체적으로 편안함을 향상시키도록 합니다 일반적인 이야기입니다만 글쓰기를 하는데 특히나 주변에 시끄럽거나 번다 하면 사실 글쓰기에 집중하기 어려워집니다 왜 그러냐 하면 글쓰기 자체가 별로 즐겁고 그런 행위가 아니기 때문에 그렇습니다 사실 글쓰기는 좀 괴롭죠 괴롭고 하기 싫은 경우가 대부분이거든요 그래서 가뜩이나 즐겁지 않은 골치 아픈 행위를 하고 있는데 주변에서 방해가 되고 잘 안 보이고 소리가 나고 시끄럽고 하면 글쓰기가 굉장히 어려워집니다 그래서 보통 글을 쓸 때는 조용하게 여러분들이 안정적으로 방해받지 않으면서 안락하게 집중해서 글을 작성할 수 있는 그런 환경이 필요하겠습니다 저를 포함해서 제가 알고 있는 많은 연구자들이 나름만의 자기만의 환경을 가지고 있는데요 어떤 분은 커피숍에 가서 조용히 앉아서 글을 쓰는 게 잘 되는 분도 있고 어떤 분은 도서관에 열람실에 조용히 있는 게 자기한테 너무 편하다는 사람도 있고 어떤 사람은 자기 책상에서 음악을 들으면서 하는 게 좋다는 사람도 있고 이것은 여러분들 스스로에게 자기만의 편안한 글쓰기의 효율을 높일 수 있는 그런 환경을 가지고 있는데요 어떤 분은 커피숍에 가서 조용히 앉아서 글을 쓰는 게 잘 되는 분도 있고 어떤 분은 커피숍에 가서 조용히 앉아서 글을 쓰는 게 잘 되는 분도 있고 그런 환경을 찾도록 노력하셔서 그런 환경을 계속 유지하고 구성하시라는 말씀이 되겠습니다 모두에게 동일한 부분은 아니겠습니다 여러분들 자신만의 글쓰기 친화적인 환경을 찾아서 만들어 나가라 하는 부분을 말씀드리고 싶습니다 또한 논문 작성에서 사용하는 컴퓨터와 소프트웨어의 사용능력을 증진시키는 것이 좋은데요 논문 작성 시 많이 사용되는 워드프로세서, 아래안글이나 MS Word 같은 것이 되겠죠 그것뿐이 아니라 여러분들은 과학기술 2공개 분야에서는 그림이나 표, 수식 이런 것들을 많이 작성하게 되는데 이때 여러분들이 많이 쓰시는 아래안글이나 MS Word뿐이 아니라 다른 여러 가지 소프트웨어들을 사용하는 경우도 많이 있습니다 대표적인 게 마이크로소프트 엑셀 같은 소프트웨어들이죠 이런 여러 가지 소프트웨어의 사용법을 일단 잘 익히시는 것이 필요합니다 필요하다면 시간 투자를 하셔서 필요 하다면 시간 투자를 하셔서 이런 사용법들을 배우십시오 만약 논문 작성이 어떤 특정한 작업 환경에서 진행되어야 한다면 해당 환경에 있는 장치나 프로그램들을 빨리 파악하고 그 사용법을 숙지하고 배울 필요가 있습니다 효율적인 학술 논문 작성을 위한 논문 작성의 두 번째 단계는 구상 및 준비 단계입니다 구상 및 준비 단계에서는 논문에서 다룰 주제들과 내용을 구상 및 준비 단계에서는 논문에서 다룰 주제들과 내용을 정리하고 조직화하여 배열하게 되는데 이 조직화하고 배열하는 과정에서 여러분들이 작성하는 논문의 구성이 결정되게 됩니다 그래서 보통 개요, 아웃라이닝은 학술 논문 작성 중 내용을 구성하여 전체적인 흐름을 보이는데 사용되는 가장 일반적인 전략 중의 하나라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 예를 들어 이 슬라이드에서 보여지고 있는 것은 여러분들이 많이 쓰시는 마이크로소프트 워드의 개요 기능을 예로 보고 계십니다 이렇게 전체 문서의 아웃라인을 먼저 잡아놓고 해당된 아웃라인에 대하여 내용을 붙이는 형태로 작업하시기를 권해드립니다 여러 가지 주제와 내용을 조직화하기 위해서 그래픽을 이용하기도 하는데 이 페이지에서 보여주고 있는 마인드 맵핑이 대표적인 방법 중 하나입니다 아마 여러분들 중학교나 고등학교 때 마인드 맵핑 방법을 이용해서 여러 가지 아이디어나 어떤 사문에 관련해서는 여러 가지 아이디어나 어떤 사문에 관련해서는 여러 가지 아이디어나 어떤 사문에 관련해서는 관련된 것들을 연관짓고 정리해 보셨을 겁니다 마인드 맵핑은 알고 계신 바와 같이 아이디어 간의 관계를 보여주면서 아이디어를 생성하고 지각적으로 구성하는 방법으로 논문을 구상할 때 여러 소주제들과 내용들을 조직화하는데 상당히 유용합니다 꼭 이 마인드 맵핑 방법뿐이 아니라 여러분들이 알고 계신 또 유용하게 생각되는 여러 가지 방법들을 통해서 관련된 주제나 소주제들 또 내용들을 이렇게 그래픽하게 정리해 보시는 것도 상당히 좋은 습관이라고 생각합니다 여러 가지 주제와 내용들을 조직화하기 위해 그래픽을 이용하는 방법 중에서 여러분들 알고 계시는 텍사노마이징 분류 방법도 있습니다 이 방법은 예제에서 볼 수 있는 것처럼 공통 특성을 기반으로 여러 가지 아이디어를 역시 지각적 으로 하고 또 그룹핑 지을 수 있는 전략 메소돌로지가 되겠습니다 논문 작성은 이렇게 하고요 논문 작성에서는 아이디어와 내용의 조직화를 위해 논리적인 순서 패턴이 사용됩니다 학술 논문에서 많이 사용되는 패턴으로는 시간별 사건 발생 순서에 따라 어떤 프로세스를 설명하는 연대순 물리적인 연관 관계에 따라 어떤 객제를 설명하는 공간순 유사성과 차이점에 대한 설명을 통해 기존 설계와 새로운 설계를 비교하는 비교 대조 방법 독자들의 관심에 따라 정해지는 중요도에 따라 비교 대조 방법을 사용하는 방법이 있습니다. 독자들의 관심에 따라 정해지는 중요도에 따라 비교 대조 방법을 사용하는 방법이 있습니다. 중요한 것에서 덜 중요한 순으로 설명하는 중요도순 문제 설명, 방법 제시, 해결책 설명과 권장사항으로 진행되는 문제 해결순 일반적인 요점을 설명하고 이후 보다 자세한 설명이나 특별한 예제가 뒤따르는 일반에서 특별로 기술하는 방법 등이 있습니다 조직화에서 이상과 같이 널리 알려진 패턴을 사용하면 논문에서 관련 내용을 알기 쉽게 설명하고 전체적으로 논리적인 흐름을 잘 따르도록 해 줄 뿐만 아니라 독자들이 내용을 쉽게 이해하고 오래 기억할 수 있도록 해주는 효과가 있습니다 여러분들 가장 익숙한 것이 아마 시간순, 공간순이 될 것 같은데요 연대순 같은 경우에 예를 들어서 관련 연구에 대한 히스토리를 설명할 때 1960년대에 이런 연구들이 있었고 70년대에 이런 연구들이 있었고 80년대에 이런 연구들이 있었고 이 런 식으로 연대순으로 설명하는 것이 굉장히 자연스럽죠 물리적으로는 예를 들어서 흔히 여러분들이 일정이나 여정을 설명한다고 했을 때 우리나라 기준으로 얘기했을 때 서울에서 출발해서 대전, 대구, 부산 이렇게 설명하는 것이 더 좋겠죠 서울 설명하고 부산 설명했다가 대전 했다가, 대구 했다가 이렇게 왔다 갔다 하는 것보다는 순서대로 독자들이 익숙하고 다음을 알고 있는 그런 어떤 순서대로 설명하는 것이 우리 관계자들이 하는 것보다도 더 잘 알고 있는 것 같아요. 과학기술 쪽에서 얘기하는 논리적인 어떤 순서 패턴에 부합된다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다 이제 효율적인 학술 논문 작성을 위한 논문 작성의 세 번째 단계로 초고 작성에 대해서 말씀드리겠습니다 일반 적으로 초고 작성에는 네 가지 방법이 있습니다 즉, 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성 그리고 교정을 결합해서 한 번에 진행하는 방법이 있고요 두 번째로는 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 교정을 결합해서 한 번에 진행하는 방법이 있고요. 두 번째로는 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 교정을 결합해서 한 번에 진행하는 방법이 있고요. 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 그리고 교정을 각각을 완전히 구별해서 별도로 진행하는 방법 세 번째로는 구상 및 준비와 초고 작성을 같이 진행하고 이후 교정 작업을 진행하는 방법 네 번째로는 구상 및 준비를 먼저 진행하고 이후 초고 작성과 교정을 같이 진행하는 방법들입니다 일반적으로 네 가지 방법들이 많이 쓰이는데요 분량이 짧은 논문일수록 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 그리고 교정을 결합해서 같이 진행하는 방법이 더 효율적입니다 그러나 분량이 길고 내용이 굉장히 복잡할수록 구상 및 준비, 초고 작성, 그리고 교정을 각각 구분하여 별도로 진행하는 법이 더 효과적이라고 알려져 있습니다 일반적으로 학술 대회나 저널에 제출하는 5 페이지에서 15 페이지 정도 분량의 논문은 구상 및 준 비와 초고 작성을 먼저 진행하고 이후 교정을 진행하는 세 번째 방법이 가장 널리 쓰이고 있는데요 이후 교정을 진행하는 세 번째 방법이 가장 널리 쓰이고 그다음에 이후 교정을 진행하는 세 번째 방법이 가장 널리 쓰이고 направья 있습니다. 가장 효과적이라고 알려져 있습니다. 이제 각각의 초고작성 방법별로 장단점을 말씀드리도록 하겠습니다. 제일 먼저 구상 및 준비, 초고작성, 그리고 교정을 결합하여 한 번에 진행하는 방법입니다. 이 방법에서는 어떻게 작성해 나갈지 명확한 아이디어가 떠오르지 않더라도 쉽게 요점과 문장을 써내려 나갈 수 있습니다. 때문에 이 방법에서는 글쓰기를 바로 시작할 수 있으며 특정 문제에 대한 명확한 해결책이 없을 때 특히 유리합니다. 그러니까 어떤 주제가 정해지면 앉아서 생각나는 것을 쭉 써내려 나가는 방법이죠. 높은 창의력을 보이고 글쓰기가 상대적으로 자유롭기 때문에 일반적으로 시작이 어려운 경우 논문 작성을 시작할 수 있는 좋은 방법입니다. 다음은 구상 및 준비, 초고작성, 그리고 교정을 시작하여 한 번에 진행하는 방법입니다. 다음은 구상 및 준비, 초고작성, 그리고 교정을 완전히 각각 구별하여 별도로 진행하는 방법입니다. 이 방법에서는 초기에 논문의 내용, 형식과 구성에 대한 세심한 계획을 세우고 이후 각 세션별로 가능한 빨리 작성이 됩니다. 마지막으로 여러모로 걸쳐서 집중적으로 완전한 교정을 진행하는 방법이 되겠습니다. 일반적으로 사용자 설명서나 교재와 같 이 굉장히 내용이 방대하고 긴 문서인데 각 세션별로 내용이 다른 경우에 많이 사용되는 방법입니다. 다음은 일반적으로 논문 작성에 가장 널리 쓰이는 적합한 방법으로 알려져 있는 구상 및 준비와 초고작성을 같이 진행하고 이후 교정을 진행하는 방법입니다. 이 방법에서는 구상 및 준비와 초고작성을 결합하여 먼저 진행하고 이후 교정작업을 진행하기 때문에 교정작업에 필요한 충분한 시간을 남겨주는 것이 중요합니다. 아까 말씀드린 것처럼 이런 교정작업이 필요하다면 교정 작업을 시작하기 전에 교정작업을 시작하는 방법이 중요합니다. 교정작업이 시작되는 방법은 교정작업의 첫 번째 방법입니다. 교정작업에 충분한 시간을 투자해야 최종적으로 완성된 완성본의 품질을 높은 수준으로 얻을 수 있습니다. 특히 이 방법에서는 글쓰기 모멘텀의 유지가 무엇보다 중요하며 일단 초고작성을 시작한 이후에는 첫 번째 초안작성 작업을 마칠 때까지 가능하면 작성을 멈추지 않는 것이 중요합니다. 때문에 구상 및 준비나 초고작성에서 작성하다 보면 생각이 안 나는 경우나 문제에 부딪히는 경우가 있는데 이때 그 문제 해결에 시간을 넣어 시간을 낭비하지 말고 이 부분은 나중에 작성, 또는 이 부분은 나중에 자료를 찾는다 하는 식으로 그냥 표시만 해놓고 해당 부분을 넘어갑니다. 초고작성에서 중요한 것은 글쓰기 모멘텀을 잊지 않고 처음부터 끝까지 드래프트를 완성하는 것이 중요하다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 드래프트는 어디까지나 드래프트고 요. 또 뒤에 충분한 교정시간을 남겨놨기 때문에 그 드래프트가 완성이 되면 이것을 가지고 높은 수준으로 수정하고 할 시간이 충분합니다. 수정하고 할 시간이 충분히 확보되어 있기 때문에 이것이 가능합니다. 이것은 일반적으로 5에서 15페이지 정도 되는 비교적 짧은 문서나 긴 문서에 포함되는 하나의 섹션을 작성할 때 효율적으로 적용되는 방법이 되겠습니다. 이 방법에서는 논문을 작성하는 행위 그 자체가 새로운 아이디어, 당면 문제에 대한 새로운 접근 방법 그리고 문제에 대한 새로운 해결책 제시에 단서가 됩니다. 또한 비록 완성도는 매우 낮더라도 드래프트니까요. 일단 초안이 완성되어 있기 때문에 어느 정도의 만족감을 얻을 수 있고 첫 초고 작성에 신경을 가진 노력을 덜 들였기 때문에 여유를 가지고 논문을 더 확정해 나가거나 교정하는데 시간을 사용할 수 있게 됩니다. 이 방법에서는 말씀드린 것처럼 글쓰기 모멘텀 유지를 위한 방해받지 않는 환경 확보가 필수적이며 구상 및 준비와 초고 작성 진행 후에는 교정 작업을 시작하기 전에 충분한 휴식을 갖는 것이 필요합니다. 이 적절한 휴식의 형태를 우리가 창의적 휴식이라고 부릅니다. 창의적 휴식이란 논문 작성 작업에서 벗어나서 마음과 두뇌를 쉬게 해주는 시간을 말하는데 창의적 휴식을 통해 보다 창의적이고 의욕적으로 또 객관적이고 꼼꼼하게 이후에 벌어지는 교정 작업을 진행할 수 있는 것이 가능해집니다. 창의적 휴식 후에는 자신이 작성했던 논문도 다르게 보이고 이전에는 생각하지 못했던 새로운 아이디어가 떠오르기 때문입니다. 그러니까 이런 것이죠. 내가 열흘이라는 시간이 있을 때 처음에 한 5일 정도 시간을 투자해서 또는 5일하고 반나절 시간을 투자해서 구상을 하고 여러 가지 자료를 수집하고 구상을 한 다음에 초고 작성을 집중적으로 진행하는 것이죠. 초고 작성을 진행하는 과정에서는 가능하면 쉬지 마시고 완성도까지 만들게 됩니다. 초고 작성이 완성되면 일단 힘들죠. 그동안 쉴 틈 없이 초고 작성을 했으니까 그런 다음에 한 반나절 정도를 쉰다는 말씀입니다. 쉴 때는 초고 작성 문서 작성 작업을 좀 잊고 음악을 듣거나 영화를 보거나 그야말로 휴식을 취하게 되는데 이러한 중간에 쉬는 작업을 통해서 반나절이나 하루 쉬었 다가 그 다음에 작성했던 초고를 보게 되면 내가 왜 이렇게 작성을 했지? 전혀 다른 측면도 보이게 되고 기존에 작성했던 부분의 잘못된 부분이나 또 기존에 초고 작성할 때 아이디어가 떠오르지 않아서 비워놨던 부분들도 이제 채워 놓을 수가 있게 된다 하는 부분이죠. 그것이 어떤 창의적 휴식의 긍정적인 효과가 되겠습니다. 주의사항은 제 경험에 의하면 창의적 휴식 때 다 좋은데 술을 마시거나 이렇게 완전히 정신을 혼미하게 하는 그런 행위가 있으면 별로 효과가 좋지는 않은 것 같습니다. 그래서 제가 좀 권해드리기로는 창의적 휴식 때는 완성된 초고를 손에 들고 또는 USB에 넣어서 주머니에 넣고 편안한 시간을 영화를 보든지 커피집에 가서 커피나 맛있는 커피나 음식을 먹든지 하는 시간을 가지시기를 권해드립니다. 마지막은 구상 및 준비를 먼저 진행하고 이후 초고 작성과 교정을 진행하여 같이 진행하는 방법입니다. 이 방법은 일반적으로 15분 정도가 되고요. 15에서 50페이지 정도의 좀 더 긴 문서를 작성하는 경우나 제안서, 특허 또는 법률문서처럼 단어 하나하나, 표현 하나하나의 선택이 매우 중 요한, 매우 정확해야 하는 이런 경우에 효과적입니다. 이 방법에서는 조직화가 매우 중요하며 그렇지 않으면 교정 진행 중 잠시 중단했을 때 다음에 와야 하는 내용을 떠올리기가 힘들어집니다. 대신 꼼꼼하게 계속 완성도 높게 작성을 하기 때문에 그때까지 작성한 내용에서 다음 아이디어를 얻을 수 있는 경우가 많기 때문에 글을 쓰다가 막히게 되면 내가 지금까지 작성한 글을 앞에 몇 문 단락을 읽어보면서 검토를 하면 그 다음에 글을 작성해 나갈 수 있는 글쓰기 장애를 극복하는데 도움이 된다는 측면의 장점도 가지고 있습니다. 초고 작성에 중요한 것은 작성을 멈추지 않고 모멘텀을 유지하는 것이라고 말씀을 드렸는데요. 논문을 작성할 때 흔히 부딪히는 글쓰기 장애를 극복하는 것입니다. 논문을 작성할 때 흔히 부딪히는 글쓰기 장애를 극복하는 것입니다. 논문을 작성할 때 흔히 부딪히는 글쓰기 장애를 극복하는 것입니다. 글쓰기 장애 요인들이 2페이지에 설명되어 있습니다. 보통 계획에 관련된 것, 여러분들 많이 경험하셨죠? 언제까지 뭘 해야 되는데 이런 것, 환경적 요인에서 기인한 것, 주제와 관 련된 것, 단어에 의해서 발생한 것, 아, 이걸 표현하는 좋은 단어가 뭘까? 이런 고민을 하다가 시간이 가는 거죠. 또 형식에서 기인한 것, 독자와 관련된 것, 기대와 위기에서 비롯된 것 등이 있습니다. 철저한 준비와 전략적 대응을 통해 철저한 준비와 전략적 대응을 통해 이러한 장애 요인을 극복하는 것이 성공적인 초고 작성과 효율적인 문서 작성에 필요하며 유능한 저자들은 이러한 장애 요인들을 다루는 방법들을 잘 알고 잘 만들어 놓고 있는 사람들이라고 생각하시면 되겠습니다. 효율적인 학술 논문 작성을 위한 논문의 마지막 단계는 교정 및 최종 완성 단계입니다. 교정은 연구 논문의 오류를 제거하여 신뢰도를 높이고 또 완성도를 높이고, 또 완성도를 제거하기 위해 가장 중요한 과정입니다. 꼼꼼하고 완전한 교정 작업에는 상당한 시간이 소요되기 때문에 말씀드린 것처럼 초기 계획 단계에서 교정에 필요한 충분한 시간을 확보해 놓으셔야 합니다. 또한 자신이 작성한 논문을 다시 객관적인 시각으로 여러 차례 살펴보고 꼼꼼하게 수정하는 교정 작업은 쉬운 작업이 아니기 때문에 교정 수행 전에 좀 차 기적 휴식을 갖는 것이 좋습니다. 교정 작업 중에는 논문을 객관적이고 비판적으로 3자의 시각에서 읽는 것이 중요하며 내용 구성, 설득력 있는 강조, 형식, 규칙, 단락조직, 문장 구조와 단원 슬립 등 여러 가지 레벨과 측면에서 꼼꼼하게 교정을 진행해야 합니다. 교정을 효율적으로 진행하기 위한 전략을 살펴보면 첫 번째, 한꺼번에 모든 측면을 살펴보기 어렵기 때문에 여러 차례에 걸쳐서 수행하는 것이 좋습니다. 무슨 말씀이냐 하면, 일단 첫 번째는 전체적으로 글의 흐름이 괜찮은지를 보기 위해서 한번 보시고요. 그때는 예를 들어서 5자가 눈에 띄어도 그냥 무시하는 거죠. 두 번째는 꼼꼼하게 단어들이 잘 괜찮은지 단어들 위주로 보고 세 번째는 5자를 한번 쭉 보고 이런 식으로 한 가지의 측면으로 전체적으로 한번씩 쭉 보면서 여러 번을 교정하는 측면이 더 효과적이라는 말씀이 되겠습니다. 또 컴퓨터 스크린을 보고 진행하기보다는 종이에 출력하여 진행하는 경우가 많습니다. 이거는 아마 개인의 취향이 되겠습니다. 나는 컴퓨터 스크린을 보고 하는 게 더 좋아. 그런 경우는 괜찮겠습니다만 일반적으로 종이에 출력해서 보시면 종이를 들고 앞뒤를 갈 수 있을 뿐 아니라 노트를 자유자재로 할 수 있기 때문에 종이에 출력해서 진행하는 것을 아직까지는 일반적으로 권해지고 있습니다. 그런데 여러분들은 특히나 디지털에 더 친숙하시거나 디지털에 더 친숙하시거나 그런 경우가 많습니다. 그런 경우가 많습니다. 그래서 편하신다면 컴퓨터 스크린을 보고 진행하는 것도 괜찮겠죠. 또한 때때로는 큰 소리를 읽으면서 오류를 찾아내기도 합니다. 참 신기하게도 눈으로 보고 찾아지지 않았던 오자나 오류 같은 것들이 소리를 내서 읽기 교정이라고 하죠. 소리를 내서 읽으면 눈에 띄기도 합니다. 그래서 이런 것도 한번 시도해 보실 필요가 있고요. 전반적인 논문의 흐름을 검토하기 위해서는 문서의 개요를 확인하는 것이 효과적이고요. 문서의 개요를 확인하는 것이 효과적이고요. 아까 보여드린 것처럼 워드프로세서의 아웃라이닝 기능 같은 것들을 아까 보여드린 것처럼 워드프로세서의 아웃라이닝 기능 같은 것들을 활용하시면 좋겠습니다. 또 반복되는 문제의 경우에는 목록을 작성해서 빠짐없이 수정이 될 수 있도록 활용하시면 좋겠습니다. 일반적으로 학술 논문의 교정은 본인이 4차례에서 5차례 또 다른 사람에 의해서 2, 3차례 결과적으로 총 7번에서 8번은 최소한 진행하는 것이 필요하다고 얘기합니다. 3자에 의한 교정 진행 시에는 나중에 그 사람에게 그 사람이 논문의 독자가 될 사람들을 찾아서 의뢰하는 것이 제일 좋고요. 여러분들의 대학원 동료, 같은 연구실의 학생들, 또 이들이 서로 상대방의 논문을 보고 교정해주는 형태의 버디 시스템을 구성해서 운용해주시는 것을 적극 권장합니다. 여러분들 대학원 연구실 동료들은 같이 연구를 하는 동료일 뿐 아니라 논문을 작성하는 과정에서 서로 도움을 주는 그런 버디가 되실 수 있습니다. 아울러 전체적으로 논문이 잘 적성되었는지 확 인하기 위해서는 도입부 부분을 다시 작성해보는 것도 좋은 방법이 되겠습니다. 학술 논문의 완성을 위한 교정 작업을 어렵게 만드는 것은 두 가지가 있는데요. 첫 번째가 완벽주의이고요. 두 번째는 지루함, 작업의 어려움이라고 말씀드릴 수 있겠습니다. 먼저 완벽주의는 좋은 논문을 작성하는데 도움이 되긴 하지만 이 완벽주의가 지나치 게 되면 교정 작업이 어려울 수 있습니다. 교정 작업을 한없이 길게 만들고 효율을 떨어뜨리게 됩니다. 완벽주의를 극복하기 위해서는 교정과 최종 편집에 투입할 수 있는 시간과 에너지에 대한 제한을 명확하게 설정해놓고 작업을 시작하시는 것이 좋습니다. 그러니까 내가 교정 작업은 금요일까지 마친다. 앞으로 4시간 동안만 한다 하는 식으로 마치는 것이 좋고요. 또한 오자, 맞춤법 오류 등 낮은 수준의 편집 작업보다는 전반적인 글의 흐름, 장과 절의 균형이나 밸런스, 부족한 부분이나 불필요한 내용들을 넣거나 빼는 것들 같은 높은 수준의 교정 작업에 더 집중하는 것이 좋습니다. 왜냐하면 낮은 수준의 편집 작업, 오자라든지 맞춤법 같은 것들은 대개의 워드 프로세스에서 자동으로 해결해주는 것이 많고 또 이런 교정 작업만 전문적으로 수행해주는 웹사이트들도 많이 있습니다. 또 논문 게재가 확정되면 출판사의 전문 편집자가 기계적으로 이 부분들을 수행해줍니다. 그렇기 때문에 여러분들이 교정 작업에서 정말 집중하고 있는 것들은 기계적으로 이 부분들을 수행해줍니다. 교정 작업에서 정말 집중해 야 할 부분은 뭐냐면 이 논문이 잘 작성이 되었는가, 구성의 흐름, 들어갈 내용이 다 들어갔는지 순서는 괜찮은지, 밸런스가 맞는지 같은 부분들에 집중하시는 것이 좋겠습니다. 아울러 논문 발간 후 여러분들이 작성한 논문에 대한 독자들의 반응을 명확하게 파악하고 논문 작성 시 생각하고 예상했던 것과 실제 독자들의 반응 차이를 보고 분석해보는 것이 그 다음 논문을 쓸 때 가장 중요한 부분입니다. 그래서 이 논문이 큰 도움이 된다는 부분을 말씀드리고 싶습니다. 교정 작업에서 만나게 되는 지독한 지루함, 작업의 어려움인데요. 이것을 극복하기 위해서는 보다 복잡한 부분에 초점을 맞춰 당면한 작업의 난이도를 높이는 것이 좋습니다. 즉, 올바른 단어 선택을 위한 단 순 편집 작업이 아니라 어떤 단어가 독자에게 부흥할 수 있는지를 고민하는, 또 전체 흐름이 괜찮은지 이런 고차원적인 고민과 노력이 교정 작업을 지루하지 않습니다. 이것이 창의적인 작업이기 때문에 그렇습니다. 또한 먼저 흥미로운 작업들을 나열하고 흥미로운 작업일수록 나중에 진행하시는 것이 좋겠습니다. 아울러 교정 작업 자체가 흥미롭지 않다는 점을 분명히 인정하고 지루함과 어려움으로 인해서 집중력이 떨어질 때는 다시 교정 작업 진행에 주의를 기울일 수 있도록 어떤 체크리스트라든지 소홀함이 없도록 그런 체제를 설정해놓고 교정 작업을 체계적으로 진행하는 것이 좋겠습니다. 이상과 같이 이번 시간에는 좋은 학술 논문을 작성하기 위한 효과적인 절차, 프로세스에 대해서 공부해 보았습니다. 경청해 주셔서 감사합니다. 3주차 제목: Academic Papers in Science and Engineering, Selecting a Target Journal for Your Academic Manuscript 내용: 안녕하세요. 논문 작성법 및 연구윤리 강좌에서 제3강부터 제6강까지를 담당하게 된 에너지과학과의 김성웅입니다. 제가 담당하게 된 제3강에서부터 6강까지는 아무래도 논문 기술에 있어서 기술적인 부분을 조금 많이 말씀을 드리도록 하게 될 것 같습니다. 먼저 제3강부터 말씀을 드리면 아카데믹 페이퍼라는 게 여러분들이 지금까지 공부해 오셨던 교과서하고는 전혀 다른 내용을 담게 됩니다. 그래서 보통 공부하셨던 텍스트 북에서나 보았던 과학적인 사실 그리고 연구 방법들에 대한 것과는 전혀 다르게 조금 많이 생각을 하고 기술을 해야 되거나 작성을 해야 되는 것들이 있습니다. 그래서 그런 부분들에 대해서 말씀을 많이 드릴텐데요. 먼저 제3강에서는 여러분들이 작성하고 있는 논문들을 어떤 저널에다가 투고를 할지 그리고 어떤 저널에 여러분들의 연구 결과가 실리게 되서 많은 사람들이 읽게 될지 이것들을 고민하는 시간을 가져보도록 하겠습니다. 먼저 그러면 시작을 하도록 할텐데 여기서 생각을 조금 해야 될게요. 페이퍼라는 게 도대체 무엇인지 그리고 논문이라는 게 도대체 어떤 것인지. 그래서 어떤 논문을 작성하는지. 먼저 제가 먼저 작성해 드리겠습니다. 먼저 제가 작성해 드리겠습니다. 어떤 논문을 작성하는지. 그리고 그게 보통은 아카데믹한 페이퍼라는 것을 생각을 하게 되는데요. 많은 기술서들이 있고 보고서들이 있습니다만 그런 것들과는 전혀 차원이 다른 게 바로 이 논문이고 과학적인 기술을 요구하는 그리고 우리가 학계에서 많이 보고 있는 페이퍼라는 것인데요. 과학 분야와 엔지니어링 분야에서 그런 페이퍼들은 도대체 어떻게 무엇을 생각을 하고 써야 되는 건지에 대해서 말씀을 한번 드려보도록 하겠습니다. 과학 분야와 엔지니어링 분야에서 그런 페이퍼라는 것을 생각을 하고 raises against ЕnSogan? 바로ensen 우리가 원하시는 질문을 말하고 싶다는 거죠. 먼저 이 강좌는 여러 교수님들께서 나눠서 진행을 하고 계시기 때문에ilogewhovarwassedesandthe Carrieo하고 계시기 때문에 많이 알 수 있습니다 first of allthis lesson has been 요�onz교수님들께서 나누어서 진행을 하고 계시기 때문에 confident이다 and strength cent Transport 모든 교수님들의 생각이 다 동일하지는 않습니다h benompovovokable 그리고 또 많은 교수님들이 사는 논문들을 쓰시지만 모든 교수님들의 생각은 다 다릅니다uanton Gimmeu 공통적인 부분에서는 기술적인 부분이 있겠지만 논문이라는 것 자체가 사람과 사람의 대화의 연속이기 때문에 어떤 내용을 어떤 생각을 가지고 그 사람들과 즉 본인이 쓰셨던 논문을 어떤 독자들이 읽을지 그리고 그 독자들이 어떤 생각으로 읽을지 이런 것들을 고민하면서 쓸 수밖에 없는 게 아카데믹 페이퍼입니다. 그렇게 되면 지금까지 여러분들이 공부해 오셨던 책, 텍스트북과는 전혀 다른 내용을 담고 있을 수밖에 없는데요. 기본적으로 논문을 쓰는 게 굉장히 어려운 일입니다. 그 이유는 여러분들이 생각하시는 것을 어떤 독자들이 어떻게 읽을지 고민을 하기 때문이고 그 독자들이 읽을 때 여러분들의 생각을 정확히 과학적인 사실에 기반해서 이해를 할 수 있게 해야 되기 때문에 굉장히 고통스럽습니다. 그래서 앞으로 지금 현재 이 강좌를 듣고 계시는 대학원생 여러분들 논문을 한 번이라도 작성을 해 보셨던 분들이거나 지금 작성을 할 기회가 있으신 분들은 아마 여기 카툰에서 보여지는 것처럼 굉장히 부담이 크고 고통스러운 나날들을 조금 지내실 텐데요. 그 이유를 한번 말씀을 드리고 왜 이건 고통보다도 즐거움인지를 한번 또 말씀을 드려보도록 하겠습니다. 먼저 위에 카툰에서 보여지는 것처럼 한 학생이 자기 생각을 그 스크린에 바로 보여줄 수 있다면 하고 생각을 하고 있습니다. 예, 저도 그렇습니다. 저도 지금 연구를 하면서 제가 얻은 연구 결과들을 어떻게 말을 해야 될지 어떤 점이 중요할지 여러 독자들에게 말을 할 때 그저 그냥 생각을 어떻게 쓸까 고민을 하는 시간들이 많이 있습니다. 그래서 그 고민하는 시간들에는 손이 바로 키보드에 가지가 않죠. 써야 되는데 쓰기가 참 어렵습니다. 그래서 계속해서 생각합니다. 아 쓰자 어떻게 쓸까 쓰자 이러고 있는 시간들이 굉장히 깁니다. 그러다가 이제 괴로워하죠. 보통은. 이런 과정들은 당연한 과정이고 어렵기 때문에 당연한 과정이라고 생각을 하면 되는데요. 근데 이 어려움은 실제로 그렇게 큰 어려움이 아닐 수도 있습니다. 그 이유를 오늘부터 3강부터 6강까지 좀 차근히 한번 말씀을 드릴 텐데요. 그 이유를 오늘부 터 3강부터 6강까지 좀 차근히 한번 말씀을 드릴 텐데요. 또 하나의 케이스는 아래 보시는 카툰인데요. 이 카툰에서는 지금 어떤 교수님께서 학생이 쓴 논문을 다시 고쳐서 참석을 해주셔서 보냈습니다. 학생에게. 학생이 그걸 보고 아 이걸 모두 다 고치셨네요 라고 합니다. 단어 하나 그리고 문법 하나 이런 거를 고치지 않고 다 고쳤습니 다. 논문의 전체를 다 고쳐버린 건데요. 단어 하나 그리고 문법 하나 그리고 문법 하나 그리고 문법 하나 그리고 문법 하나 그리고 문법 하나고 우리가 교수를 SAIь하는 거거든요. 나는 그저 후史의 현실 돌� beating을ization 실수로 고쳐버려 가지고 있어서 그는 다 고치는 게 Showsa cambio란 desdeック 아니면 것보다 더 시씩 기출한 거를 하겠죠. 나는 그서forderitat,다는 키워드를 반영 보셨는데. 그 교수님께서 하시는 말씀이 어떤 부분을 고치는 것보다 지적을 해주는 것보다 전체를 다 써버리는 게 쉽 다 라고 말씀을 하십니다. 한국의 prepare for a success이라는 것이 하나의 교수로 나오죠. 여기에 굉장히 중요한 점들이 들어가 있는데요. 아. 얘기를 한도 끝이agner입니다. 시작과 끝까지 1 2 3 4 4 Poland. 스 truly bones. 그런데 그 작성된 스토리는 개인의 생각입니다. 즉, 학생들, 여러분들께서 쓰시고 계시는 생각과 그 논문을 가지고 같이 연구하셨던 공동연구자들의 생각이 다 담겨져 있습니다. 그 사람들마다 다 다른 생각들을 하나의 논문으로 하기 때문에 어떤 한 사람이 논문을 쓰기 시작하 면 그 사람의 생각이 처음부터 끝까지 다 담기게 됩니다. 그래서 여러분들이 생각하셨던 오류라는 것들이 분명히 있을 수도 있는데요. 그 오류라는 것을 하나로 고치게 되면 그 사람이 다시 고치고 있는 사람이 다시 고칠 때는 그 오류 하나만을 잡는 게 아니고 그 사람의 생각을 처음부터 끝까지 나타내 줘야 되기 때문에 전체를 고치는 게 대단히 쉽습니다. 실제 저도 저희 학생들이 가지고 오는 페이퍼를 2월 페이지, 20페이지 하더라도 하나하나 단어 그리고 문장 하나하나 고치다 보면 전체를 고쳐놓고 보면 도대체 이건 내가 왜 고쳤지? 왜 이런 말로 했지라는 생각을 하게 됩니다. 그래서 또 다시 전체를 고치는 기간을 또 가지게 됩니다. 그러면 제가 고쳤던 부분에 대해서 는 여기 옆에 카툰에서 보여주는 것처럼 교수님께 가져갔더니 고쳐주셔서 다시 그 고친 것을 받아서 다시 작성을 했고 교수님께 다시 보여주면 그 교수님께서는 다시 다 고칩니다. 그리고 그 교수님께서는 다시 다 고칩니다. 그리고 또 다시 여러분들에게 돌려주죠. 그래서 이 사이클이 영원합니다. 솔직히 말씀을 드리면. 그리고 여러분들이 오케이 하기 전, 여러분들은 오케이 했어도 교수님께서 오케이 하시거나 공동연구자들이 오케이 하기 전까지는 서밋하기가 어렵죠. 그래서 서밋할 때까지의 이 과정들은 굉장히 지난하기도 하고 어렵기도 하고 끝이 없을 수도 있습니다. 그렇지만 이렇게 고쳐가는 과정들에서 가장 중요한 거 하나는요. 여러분들의 생각이 얼마만큼 잘 담겼 는지 그리고 그게 처음부터 끝까지 일관성이 있게 잘 담겼는지가 대단히 중요하게 됩니다. 뭐 이런 과정들을 겪으면서 수백 편의 논문을 쓰고 수십 편의 논문을 써보면서 잘 쓸 수 있게 되고 뭐 그런 상황이 오기는 하지만 처음에 여러분들이 작성을 하는 거 논문이란 게 어떤 건지 읽기만 했다가 실제 작성을 하기에는 상당히 어려운 점이 있습니다. 그래서 그런 점들을 같이 얘기를 하면서 그렇게 어려운 것만은 아니다 라는 말씀을 드리고자 합니다. 처음에 서두에서 말씀드렸다시피 논문 작성이라는 것은 여러분들의 생각을 다른 사람들이 즉 독자 독자들이 어떻게 볼지 그리고 독자들이 보기 전까지도 많은 연구자들 그리고 논문의 에디터들과 소통을 하게 됩니다. 그 소통을 하는 방식에 있어서 여러가지 커뮤니케이션을 하는 방식에 있어서 여러가지 커뮤니케이션을 하는 방식에 있어서 여러가지 커뮤니케이션을 하는 방식이 있습니다. 하는 방식이 사람과 사람의 사이이기 때문에 여러분은 혼자여도 다른 사람들이 그 다른 사람들은 다 각자의 생각들이 있기 때문에 항상 다른 반응들이 오게 됩니다 그 반응의 몇 가지 것을 말씀을 드리고 그 반응들에 대해서 뭐 어려워하는 필요가 없다는 것을 한번 말씀을 드려보도록 하겠습니다 어 1 예로 어떤 페이퍼를 작성을 해서 이렇게 뭐 논문을 투고를 했습니다 투고를 하고 다행스럽게 에디터를 통과를 해서 에디터를 통과를 한다는 말씀은 어 이제 논문을 투고하는 과정 그리고 논문이 어떻게 만들어지는지에 대한 과정은 나중에 말씀을 드릴 텐데요 다행스럽게 에디터를 통과를 해서 리뷰 프로세스를 들어갔습니다 이 리뷰 프로세스를 들어가서 온 레프리의 내용입니다 이 논문은 어떤 어떤 어떤 주제에 대한 이 논문은 무엇을 뭐 리포트하고 있겠습니까? 이 리뷰 프로세스에 대한 이 논문은 무엇을 뭐 리포트하고 있겠습니까? 이 리뷰 프로세스에 대한 이 논문은 무엇을 뭐 리포트하고 있겠습니까? 근데 재밌는 결과가 있다 재밌는 결과는 1번 2번 이렇게 뭐 정리를 해 줬습니다 이렇게 정리를 해 줬다 라는 말은 어쩌면 이 레프리는 이 논문을 정말 열심히 읽어줬다 일 수도 있구요 그리고 대충 읽어보고 대충 이라는 말은 여러분들이 쓰신 abstract 초록에 대해서만 읽고 저 정도는 정 리를 할 수 있습니다 그러니까 그거를 꼭 여러분들에게 이렇게 레프리들이 적어준 것들을 모두 정리하고 정리할 수 있습니다. 모두 다 믿을 필요는 없다는 말씀인데요 왜냐하면 초록만 보고도 저 두 개 정도에 여러분들이 논문을 잘 작성을 하셨으면 저렇게 중요하다라고 하는 포인트들 두 가지 혹은 서너 가지 정도에 대해서는 경험이 많은 그리고 오랫동안 연구를 해오고 논문을 쓰셨던 분들의 입장에서는 매우 쉽게 저것들을 픽업을 할 수가 있습니다 그래서 그 결과들에 대해서는 굉장히 재미있다 라고 말씀을 해 주셨습니다 그래서 그 결과들에 대해서는 굉장히 재미있다 라고 말씀을 해 주셨습니다 그런데 이런 결과들은 전혀 시그니피션드 하지도 않고 네이처나 네이처 저널 에 실릴 만큼 충분하지 않은 노벨티를 가지고 있다라고 합니다 그러면 이 워딩은 도대체 뭐지? 재미있다 라고는 하는데 안된다 이렇게 되면 여러분들은 굉장히 서운해 하실 겁니다 왜 재미있다고 하면서 안된다고 할까? 그래서 앞으로 말씀드릴 내용이 이렇게 표현을 하는 것입니다. 그런데 어떤 사람들의 생각을 잘 읽어 볼 필요가 있습니다 여러분들의 연구 결과가 재미있긴 하지만 여러분들이 쓰셨던 논문 네이처나 네이처리서치 저널들의 투고가 되서 실리기에는 아직은 뭔가 시그니피션드가 부족하다는 표현이 있겠습니다 저게 여러분들의 능력이나 여러분들의 연구결과를 매우 안 좋게 보는 건 절대 아닙니다 그래서 결코 저런 문장에 대해서 리뷰 어포인트들에서 저 사람의 생각을 잘 읽어봤다가 너무나lexikwill적으로 할 수 있을 지금은Phisher della munir criticer의 Cam ан�� cab Pattone 입장에서 사람의 생각을 그냥 그대로 받아들일 필요는 없습니다. 왜냐하면 저 레프리의 생각은 재밌다고도 하면서도 부족하다고 하지만 저건 일 개인의 생각입니다. 저 부족하다는 거가 여러분들의 논문의 가치, 논문의 가치보다는 여러분들의 연구 결과의 가치를 결정하지는 않습니다. 그렇기 때문에 저 일 개인의 레프리의 생각에 동의를 할 수도 있고요. 동의를 하지 않을 수도 있습니다. 그래서 보통은 동의를 하지 않습니다. 왜냐하면 자기의 연구 결과를 다른 사람이 보고 안 좋다라고 생각을 했으면 동의를 안 하는 게 정상입니다. 거기서 동의를 해 버리면 여러분들은 연구 논문을 쓰실 때부터 잘못 쓰셨을 수도 있습니다. 그래서 동의를 하지 않고 다시 대화를 하게 됩니다. 소통을 하는 거죠. 그래서 이 논문에서는 실제로 우리가 어떤 것들을 했지만 조금은 우리가 믿었지만 좀 수준ip쯔를 한 번 깨끗하게 정획 글을zer access주지고 다시 정답íamos 뭔가는he 망ardı 배 miracles 이런 이런 오� whoa 내가 있어요 east entered v crue crystal 시� gear 뒤중 invited another you controller x m computation 들었다 이렇게 얘기를 해주고 이 웍이 대단히 재미있다 재미있으면서도 페이퍼도 매우 잘 썼다 well organized 라는 말은 되게 쉽게 들을 수는 없지만요 듣게 되면 매우 기분이 좋습니다 왜냐하면 페이퍼는 처음부터 끝까지 잘 작성을 해야 되는 지나는 고난이 기간이 있는데 이것을 잘 했다는 뜻이 되기 때문에 그래서 이렇게 잘 했음에도 불구하고 이 웍의 significance 중요도는 충분하지 않다 하이 퀄리티 저널의 네이처 같은 이렇게 표현이 됩니다 네이처 사이언스 이런 하이 임팩트 저널에서는 어려울 수도 있겠습니다만 그게 여러분들의 결과들을 아까 말씀드렸던 것처럼 연구 결과들을 매우 안 좋다라고 판단하는 것은 아니다 라는 말씀을 다시 한번 드립니다 그래서 이렇게 표현을 하는 warrant 하지 않다 publication 할 정도로 충분하지 않다 라고 하는 것은 저 레프리의 생각일 뿐입니다 그렇게 되면 이 레프리는 그런 생각을 했으면 그것보다는 조금 더 낮은 단계의 낮은 레벨의 논문에 투구를 할 것을 이제 뭐 suggestion을 하게 되죠 보통은 저렇게 suggestion 합니다 그러면 여러분들은 또 suggestion을 받을 때에 그 논문에 갈 수도 있지만요 저 말을 인정을 할 수도 있기 때문에 그렇게 되면 네이처라든지 에디터가 또는 레프리가 레프리는 동의를 할 수도 있습니다만은 기본적으로는 다른 사람들이 다시 여러분들의 논문을 보게 됩니다 그렇게 되면 또 한 번에 이런 과정들을 겪기 때문에 그 과정을 겪기 전에 이 레프리가 어쩌면 조금의 misunderstanding이 있었을 때에 이런 과정을 겪기 전에 이 레프리가 어쩌면 조금의 misunderstanding이 있었을 때에 이런 과정을 겪기 전에 이 레프리가 어쩌면 조금의 misunderstanding이 있었을 때에 그리고 � cercakeys요 떮을 수nah consequence as 잡가서 says 열심히 읽지 않았다는 것을 대화를 하지 않고서도 저 문장으로 알게 됩니다. 이렇게 알게 됐다면 여러분들이 하실 수 있는 방법은 크게 두 가지가 있죠. 그래, 포기할게. 아니면 열심히 읽지 않았으니 다시 한번 대화를 해서 소통을 하고 그 생각을 바꿔야 되겠네 라고 하실 수 있습니다. 저 같은 경우는 저도 일개인이기 때문에요. 저 같은 경우는 항상 두 번째의 선택지를 선택합니다. 항상 다시 얘기를 합니다. 다시 얘기를 하고 정말 많은 얘기를 거치면서 안 될 때 포기를 하고 다른 논문으로 다른 저널에 투고를 다시 하게 되기도 합니다. 이렇게 리젝을 당하고 리젝을 당해서 받아들이고 다른 논문에 내기까지 여러 사람들과 여러 사람들의 그 가까운 생각이 다 다른 생각들을 소통을 하게 되는 과정들이 굉장히 오랜 시간이 걸립니다. 그래서 이런 생각들을 본인의 생각을 논문을 쓰시고 계시는 여러분들 학생분들의 그 생각들 그리고 그것을 교수님들과 그리고 공동 연구자들과 정리를 하면서 그 생각을 다른 사람들에게 정확하게 전달을 하고 정확하게 왜 이 연구가 더 훌륭한 연구이고 과학적으로 가치가 있는지를 정리해내는 것입니다. 정확하게 말할 수 있는 그런 방법들을 여러분들이 잘 아시는 게 매우 중요하다고 생각을 하고 있습니다 그래서 이렇게 많은 사람들과 소통을 하는 데 있어서 여러분들이 이제 기술적으로 논문이라는 것은 이런 거 부다 라는 것을 조금 아실 필요가 있는데요 그 논문은 정말로 여러분들이 인터넷에서 검색을 하시면서도 금방 파악이 되시겠지만 정말 많은 전원이 있고 그 전월마다 굉장히 많은 논문들이 항상 출판이 되고 있습니다 그래서 이 수많은 출판된 논문들 중에서 여러분들이 어떤 논문을 선택을 하셔야 하는지 그리고 왜 선택을 해야 되는지 그런 선택의 과정들에 대해서 한번 말씀을 드려보도록 하겠습니다 보통 이렇게 많은 논문들은 그 논문들을 그냥 여러분들이 아시는 것처럼 어디에서부터 어디까지 분야에서부터 또는 레벨에서부터 레벨까지 고려를 해서 외부부 사항을 고려하고 있는 것입니다 그래서 이런 것들을 클래리베이트 사이언스 라는 곳에서 클래리베이트 아날리틱스 라는 곳에서 이렇게 분류를 해 놓고 여러분들이 쉽게 어떤 논문이 나의 연구 결과 그리고 왜 이 논문에 가야 될지 이런 것들을 정리할 수 있게 판단할 수 있게 도와주고 있습니다 여기 보시는 것처럼 SCI라고 많이 들어보셨을 텐데요 사이언티픽한 논문들은 보통 SCI나 SCI-E 엔지니어링이나 기초과학에 대한 논문들은 저 두 논문들 중에서 가장 중요한 논문들입니다 그래서 각각의 분류에 속하게 되어 있는 논문들에 대해서 여러분들이 어떤 논문들이 있는지 쳐다보게 되고 그 논문들에 투고를 하게 되는 과정이 있습니다 그 투고를 하게 되는 과정에 선택을 하는 과정에 있어서 첫 번째 여러분들이 고민을 하시는 보통은 저도 그렇습니다 그렇지만 고민을 하시는 분류할 수 있는 방법이 임팩트 팩터라고 하는 파라미터가 있습니다 이 임팩트 팩터는 여러분들이 논문을 어느 논문에 투고를 할지를 결정해주는 매우 중요한 수단이 될 수도 있는데요 실제로 본인들이 생각하는 연구 논문이 매우 대단하다고 생각을 하면 임팩트 팩터가 매우 높은 저널 그리고 조금 이거는 이 분야에서는 중요하기는 하지만 긴급한 정도도 아니고 조금 이거는 이 분야에서는 중요하기는 하지만 긴급한 정도도 아니고 남들도 이 정도는 다 보여주고 있으니 임팩트 팩터가 어느 정도 선에서 있는 저널 이런 식으로 고르시게 됩니다 그 고르는 거는 여러분들이 직접 고르시기도 하고 공동 연구자들과 같이 고르시기도 하는데요 예를 들어서 이 임팩트 팩터가 뭘 얘기를 해주는지를 잘 생각을 해 보시면 왜 골라야 하는지를 아실 수가 있습니다 이 임팩트 팩터의 숫자는 논문의 레벨을 결정을 하기도 하지요 그런데 논문의 레벨을 어떻게 결정하는지에 대해서는 그런데 논문의 레벨을 어떻게 결정하는지에 대해서는 여기 임팩트 팩터를 계산하는 방법에서 쉽게 아실 수 있습니다 2년 동안 어떤 잡지에서 퍼블리시가 된 논문의 숫자와 그런 퍼블리시된 논문들이 2년 동안 얼마만큼 많이 인용되어 있는지 그 비로 비례로 결정을 하게 됩니다 그러면 논문의 숫자는 적고 사이테이션 넘버가 많다 즉 다른 연구자들이 이 잡지에 출판이 된 논문들을 많이 인용을 하거나 즉 다른 연구자들이 이 잡지에 출판이 된 논문들을 많이 인용을 하거나 즉 다른 연구자들이 이 잡지에 출판이 된 논문들을 많이 인용을 하거나 그 연구 결과가 좋던 나쁘던 많이 인용을 했다고 하면 임팩트 팩터는 높습니다 많이 인용을 했다는 뜻은 인용을 하지 않을 수도 있기 때문에요 많이 인용을 했다는 뜻은 인용하지 않은 사람들과 인용을 한 사람들 정말 많은 연구자들이 읽었다는 뜻이 됩니다 많은 사람들이 읽을 수 있다 그러면 많은 사람들이 중요하다고 생각하는 연구 결과들이 나오는 잡지 라고 생각합니다 그러면 많은 사람들이 중요하다고 생각하는 연구 결과들이 나오는 잡지라고 생각을 합니다 그래서 영국 독등국회의에서 기영경 기입 위원장과 zdee.cf을 사연을 해석하고 있었다는 내용을 상상하시며 그래서 여러분들도 그런 하이 임팩트 저널의 논문들을 가지고 공부를 하고 계실 수도 있습니다. 그렇기 때문에 많은 사람들이 읽히기를 바라면서 논문을 내는 거지 몇 명의 사람들만 읽을 수 있으면 좋겠다라고 생각을 하고 논문을 작성을 하고 그 고통스러운 시간들을 참아가면서 논문을 작성을 하지는 않습니다. 그래서 보통은 임팩트 팩터를 기준으로 해서 나의 지금 쓰고 있는 논문은 어느 정도 많은 사람들이 읽히기를 바라고 그 읽히기를 바라는 것도 그 논문마다 분야의 브로드한 스콥이 다 넓을 수도 있고 좁을 수도 있고 다 다릅니다. 그래서 그런 저널을 선택하는 데 있어서 첫 번째로 많은 사람들에게 읽힐지 그리고 그 본인들의 논문의 연구 결과의 중요도를 고민해서 고르게 됩니다. 실제로 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 어떤 had 어떤 Apa 어떤orsa 어떻게 어떤 어떻게 어떻게 어떻게 이렇게 이렇게 이렇게 좋겠습니다. 물론 그래서 제가 선생님과 дело는 이렇게 나오게 됩니다. 어떤 한 사람의 논문일 수도 있지만 구글 스칼라를 치기만 하면 제목 밑에 항상 몇 번의 인용이 되었습니다. 라고 써져 있습니다. 몇 번의 인용이 되어 있는 게 중요하죠. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 읽고 그 연구 결과의 중요도가 결정이 되니까요. 그래서 보통은 여기처럼 사이언스라든지 네이처 피직스라든지 여러분들이 아시는 굉장히 높은 레벨의 저널들에 항상 많은 인용도가 기록되게 됩니다. 그래서 임팩트 팩터가 높은 저널에 많이 투고를 하고자 하는 겁니다. 기본적으로 임팩트 팩터가 높은 저널을 가지고자 하는 것보다는 내 연구 결과가 많은 사람들과 소통을 하게 되면서 많은 사람들이 인정을 하고 받아들이고 그 연구 결과를 다시 이용을 하고 이런 과정들을 겪고자 했기 때문에 이런 높은 인용도를 가지는 하이 임팩트 저널에 투고를 하게 됩니다. 그러면 여러분들은 항상 이렇게 높은 저널에만 투고를 할 것이냐 이런 문제가 발생을 하게 되는데요. 실제로는 그게 매우 어려운 과정이 기 때문에 어려운 일이기 때문에 여러분들이 투고를 하는 논문들을 잘 결정을 해야 될 필요가 있습니다. 그래서 그 결정하는 방법들이라든지에 대해서 간단하게 말씀을 드리겠습니다. 개인적으로 저한테만 물어보신다고 하면 개개인의 성향이 다 다르기 때문에요. 저는 항상 높은 임팩트 팩터를 추구하고요. 항상 높은 임팩트 팩터를 추구를 해서 많은 실패의 과정들을 겪고 낮은 임팩트 팩터의 논문까지 퍼블리시가 되기도 합니다. 그렇게 많은 시간을 소요하면서까지 왜 이렇게 높은 임팩트 팩터를 내려고 노력을 하는지에 대해서 말씀을 해보면 논문이라는 것은 어떤 논문에 투고를 해야 될지 그리고 어떤 논문에 실려야 될지 그걸 굉장히 중요하게 고민을 해야 되는데요. 왜냐하면 논문을 퍼블리싱하는 목적이 있습니다. 그리고 그 목적은 많이 읽히기를 바라기 때문입니다. 많이 읽히기를 바라니 높은 임팩트 팩터를 요구를 원하게 될 거고요. 그렇게 되면 높은 임팩트 팩터는 실제로 빠른 시간에 퍼블리싱이 됩니다. 낮은 임팩트 팩터보다는 높은 임팩트 팩터에서 빠른 시간에 퍼블리싱이 되는 케이스가 많은데요. 그렇게 되면 이 빠른 시간 안에 내 논문 연구 결과를 세상에 보여주고서는 다른 많은 연구자들과 항상 경쟁 관계에 놓여 있으시기 때문이죠. 이 경쟁 관계도 어렵지만 이 경쟁 관계를 이겨서 빠른 시간 안에 나의 좋은 연구 결과를 좋은 연구 저널에 투고를 한다는 점이 그리고 퍼블리싱을 한다는 점이 매우 중요하게 됩니다. 어떤 논문을 결정을 할지는 결정을 하는데 몇 가지 생각을 해봐야 되는 포인트들이 있습니다. 먼저 비저빌리티를, 비저빌리티를 높여야만 합니다. 여러분들의 연구는 연구자이시기 때문에요. 여러분들의 연구 결과를 좋은 연구 결과를 많은 사람들에게 보여주면서 여러분들이 누구다 라고 하는 게 보여지게 되는데요. 이것을 향상시키기 위해서 논문을 결정하기도 합니다. 그리고 여기처럼 시간과 노력을 세이브를 하고자 합니다. 왜냐면 임팩트 팩터가 높은 저널에서부터 투고를 하게 되면 본인들이 썼던 논문이 많이 리젝이 될까 하는 생각을 하고요. 그래서 이 논문을 제출할 수 있는 가능성도 있죠. 그렇다 보면 시간이 다시 들어가게 되고요. 그리고 논문을 똑같은 형식으로 제출을 하지 않고 다시 고쳐야 되는 노력이 또 들어가게 됩니다. 그래서 이런 시간들을 그리고 퍼블리싱 될 때까지의 사람들과의 소통을 하는 시간들까지 고려를 하게 되면 충분히 그런 시간들을 아끼고자 하는 노력이 고민을 할 수 있는 포인트가 생깁니다. 그리고 또 하나는 그것과 함께 재생을 할 수 있는 것입니다. 대출했던 연구 논문들에서 퍼블리싱이 될 때까지 퍼블리싱이 안 되고 리젝이 되는 이 상황들을 많이 겪으실 수도 있습니다. 그래서 이런 것들을 좀 줄이기 위해서 많은 좋은 가장 적절한 논문들을 여러분들이 선택을 하시게 됩니다. 그래서 보통은 이렇게 몇 가지의 생각들을 하게 되는데요. 여러분들이 논문을 고르실 때 가장 먼저 생각을 하실 점은 여러분들이 어떤 연구를 하시는지에 대해서 생각을 하셔야 됩니다. 하고 계시고 그리고 여러분들이 직접 어떤 연구 논문들을 전월들을 읽고 계시는지를 잘 한번 생각을 해보시면 됩니다 그러면 그 연구는 여러분들이 읽고 계시는 전월들은요 여러분들의 연구 결과 비슷하고 그리고 그 연구 결과를 공부를 하기 위해서 많은 그 잡지를 읽고 계실 겁니다 논문들을 그래서 보통은 여러분들이 읽고 계시는 논문들의 투고를 하는게 정상적입니다 그러면 여러분들이 배우시고 있고 공부를 하시고 있기 때문에 높은 레벨의 전월들일 가능성이 매우 높습니다 그래서 항상 높은 레벨부터 낼 것이냐에 문제가 있지만 이렇게 몇 가지의 전월들을 후보들을 결정을 하실 수가 있습니다 여러분들이 직접 보고 공부하고 있는 논문들에 대해서 그러면 그 중에서도 골라야 하는 이유가 있는데요 예를 들면 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 네이처나 사이언스 그리고 분야가 다르게 되는데요 그리고 어드밴스드 머츄리얼 이렇게 4가지의 잡지가 있다고 생각을 해보시면 하이팩트 저널이 네이처와 사이언스는 인터 디스플로널이기 때문에 굉장히 브로드한 스콥 들을 많이 가지고 있습니다 논문들에서 바이오도 있구요 머츄리얼도 있구 요 케미스트리 도 있습니다 피직스 도 있고 굉장히 뭐 지올로지도 있구요 굉장히 넓은 전체 필드에 논문들을 모두 다 보여주고 있습니다 그래서 여러분들 가장 먼저는 Nature Science를 선택하실 수도 있습니다. 그렇지만 여러분들의 연구 결과가 Scope이 조금 Specific하다, 조금은 좁다 라는 생각이 들 수도 있으십니다. 그러면 Nature 보 다는 Nano를 연구하셨다면 Nano Technology를 선택을 하시게 되죠. 또는 재료를 하셨으면 Advanced Motoring이나 이런 논문들을 선택을 하시게 되는데 선택을 하시는 데 있어서 가장 먼저 하셔야 될 일은 후보들을 정하셨으면 그 논문에 Scope을 읽어보시기를 강력하게 권유 드립니다. 왜냐하면 어떤 논문들이든요. 자기 잡지에서 원하는 Scope이 있습니다. 근데 그 Scope과 맞지 않은 논문, 예를 들어서 Nano를 연구하셨는데 Nano 안에서 Nano 재료를 연구하셨는데 그 Nano 재료를 가지고 Photonics를 연구를 하셨습니다. 그렇지만 Nano 재료이기 때문에 Nature Nanotechnology를 갈 수도 있구요. Nature Photonics를 갈 수도 있습니다. 그렇지만 여러분들의 연구 결과에 가장 중요한 Significance가 뭔지를 생각을 해보시면 그 Scope에 맞는 Journal은 Nanotechnology 일 수도 있고, Photonics도 포토닉스 일 수도 있습니다. 그런 것처럼 여러분들은 이 잡지에 Scope을 항상 고민을 하시고 결정을 하시는 게 매우 중요합니다. 그래서 보내게 됩니다. 그리고 보내고 나서 Journal의 Response가 오고, Publishing 할 때까지의 결과가 어 Publishing이 되면 여러분들은 적절한 Paper를 Journal을 골랐다고 생각을 하실 수가 있게 되는 거죠. 이 긴 고난동안 여러분들이 고민을 해야 되는 점들이 몇 가지 있습니다만, 이런 것들은 굉장히 기술적이기 때문에 앞으로 계속 말씀을 드릴 겁니다. 그래서 먼저 저도 열심히 좋은 논문을 쓰기 위해서 노력하지만 여러분들하고 똑같이 그 방법 중에 가장 먼저 시간을 줄이기 위한 방법을 한번 말씀을 드려보도록 하겠습니다. 시간을 줄이기 위해서 보통 하는 방법들은 빨리 작성을 해서 빨리 투고한다 가 아닐 수도 있습니다. 어쩌면, 에디터가 각각의 잡지마다 에디터가 있는 이유는 여러분들의 논문을 받아서 읽어보고 리뷰를 보낼지, 리뷰 프로세스를 보낼지 고 민하는 기간이 있습니다. 이 기간이 보통은 2주에서부터 짧게는... 제가 경험하지만, 보통은 2주에서 2주가 되기 때문에, 그 기간이 길게 옵니다. 그래서 보통은 2주에서 2주까지가 되기 때문에, 그 기간을 좀 더 빨리 투고하자. 바로는 짧게는 하루 정도 24시간 정도 길게는 한 달 정도 이렇게 시간이 들어가는 기간이 있습니다 그래서 이 기간을 매우 줄이고 그리고 다음 단계로 빨리 넘어가게 하기 위한 방법이 하나가 있는데요 많은 분들이 하지는 않은 걸로 알고 있습니다만은 한번 학생 때부터 해보도록 권유를 드리고 싶은게 교수님들과 함께 논문을 투고 하기 전에 이 잡지에 내 논문을 먼저 보내 보는 겁니다 에디터에게만 에디터에게 보내서 이 잡지에 내 논문이 이 정도의 시그니피션트가 있기 때문에 무조건 뭐 퍼블리쉬가 돼야 될 이유가 있다 라고 한번 말을 전달을 해보는 거죠 내 생각이니까 상관은 없습니다 그 사람들은 에디터들은 받아들일 수도 있고요 아니면 무시할 수도 있고요 아니면 답장을 잘해서 여러분들이 다음달에 공부할 수 있는지에 대해서는 상관없습니다. 그래서 이 단계로 바로 넘어갈 수 있게 해 줄 수도 있습니다 근데 이렇게 좋은 연구 결과를 먼저 에디터들과 소통을 해서 프로세스를 조금 더 짧게 해 가는 과정들이 있고 이 과정이 만약에 좋다라고 하면 좋은 결과를 얻어서 리뷰 프로세스를 넘어갔다 라고 하면 제 개인적인 경험으로는 논문이 될 확률이 매우 높아집니다 그래서 프리섬미션에 프리섬미션에 인퀘이리를 항상 해보는 것도 굉장히 좋은 방법이기 때문에 이런 과정들은 꼭 해보시고 계시길 바랍니다. 그래서 이렇게 논문을 골라가는 과정들을 앞으로 조금 더 디테일하게 테크닉한 부분들에 대해서 다음 4화장에서 말씀을 드리도록 하겠습니다 그래서 이렇게 논문을 골라가는 과정들을 앞으로 조금 더 디테일하게 테크닉한 부분들에 대해서 다음 4 화장에서 말씀을 드리도록 하겠습니다 4주차 제목: Structure of an academic paper Storytelling method for academic papers Preparing for writing academic papers 내용: 네, 논문 작성법 및 연구윤리 제4강입니다. 이번 강좌에서는 아카데믹 페이퍼의 스트럭처, 구조, 어떻게 논문이 구성되어 있는지 그리고 3강에서 말씀드렸던 것처럼 많은 사람들과 소통을 하기 위해서 어떤 방식을 취해야 되는지 그리고 잘 쓰기 위해서 어떻게 준비를 해야 되는지에 대해서 말씀을 드리도록 하겠습니다. 먼저 페이퍼의 구조입니다. 여러분들이 지금 많이 공부를 하시고 계시는 여러 논문들을 보시면 페이퍼들마다 구성이 조금씩은 다릅니다. 그렇지만 기본적인 구성이라는 것은 정해져 있기 때문에 그 정해진 룰에서 조금씩 변형된 형태로 각각의 논문들이 정해진다고 생각하시면 됩니다. 여러분들이 정하시는 하이 임팩트 전월, 그리고 낮은 임팩트의 전월까지 각각의 모든 논문들의 스코프도 다르기도 하면서 구성이 다를 수도 있습니다. 또 하나는 페이퍼가 어떤 페이퍼인지에 따라서도 구성이 다 다르기 때문에 이 구성에 대해서 한번 살펴보고 그 구성에서 각각의 구성마다 중요한 내용들에 대해서 언급을 해보도록 하겠습니다. 먼저 빨리 빨리 슬라이드를 넘겨볼 텐데요. 먼저 타이틀이고요. 타이틀 그리고 그 다음에 항상 아시는 것처럼 저자들입니다. 저자들이 있고 가장 먼저 나오는 문장은 Obstract, 초록의 문장들이 있습니다. 다시 초록이 끝나면 보통은 서론, Introduction이 시작이 되고요. Introduction이 끝나면 보통은 Maturals and Method가 들어가기도 하고 안 들어가기도 합니다. 왜냐하면 전월마다 이 Maturals and Method 가 제일 뒷부분에 있습니다. 그리고 다른 서프문처리처럼 다른 파일에 출판이 되기도 하니깐요. 또 하나는 Introduction이 끝나고 항상 Method나 Maturals에 대한 얘기가 끝나면 가장 중요한 Result 그리고 Discussion이 나오게 됩니다. 이 Result하고 Discussion은 한 통으로 한 섹션으로 나오기도 하고요. 분리되서 나오기도 합니다. 쓰는 방법은 여러분들이 결정하시기도 하지만 여러분들이 타겟팅하시기도 합니다. 여러분들이 타겟팅하시기도 하지만 여러분들이 타겟팅하시기도 합니다. 여러분들이 타겟팅하시기도 하지만 여러분들이 타겟팅하시기도 합니다. 저 저널에 맞춰서 작성을 하실 수도 있습니다. 그리고 그렇게 나오게 되면 구성은 글로만 하는 게 아니고 여러분들이 아시다시피 그림, 피겨로도 보여주고 테이블로도 정리해서 연구 결과를 말씀하시게 되죠. 또 하나는 이렇게 끝나게 되면 보통은 이 논문은 어떤 어떤한 도움으로 실행이 됐다 라고 말씀하시는 Acknowledgement가 있고 이 논문은 다른 방법이 있습니다. 이 논문은 다른 방법이 있습니다. 논문들과 어떤 논문들을 인용을 했고 그 인용한 내용들이 어디 어디에 기술되어 있다고 말씀을 하시게 되는 레퍼런스 부분들이 있습니다 이렇게 해서 논문들의 10가지 정도의 그리고 또는 뭐 작게는 6가지 정도의 부분들로 섹션들로 나누게 되는데요 이 각각의 부분들이 하나하나마다 여러분들이 생각을 해보셔야 될 포인트들이 여러가지들이 있습니다 자 그러면 먼저 여러분들의 경험에 비추어서 말씀을 많이 드리도록 노력을 해볼 텐데요 먼저 논문을 읽으실 때 무엇부터 읽으실지 한번 본인들께서 생각을 해보시면 그 시그니피션스의 정도는 결정이 됩니다 항상 그렇듯이 타이틀부터 읽으시죠 타이틀부터 읽으십니다 예 저자부터 읽을 일은 없죠 어쩌면 굉장히 훌륭한 교수님들의 연구 논문을 보기 위해서 그 교수님의 논문만을 찾기 위한 그 교수님의 논문만을 찾기 위한 저자부터 읽을 일은 없죠 어쩌면 굉장히 훌륭한 교수님들의 연구 논문을 보기 위해서 그 교수님의 논문만을 찾기 위한 노력이 있을 수도 있죠 그러면 오서부터 찾아보실 수도 있습니다 그렇지만 보통은 타이틀부터 봅니다 타이틀을 보면 가장 먼저 이건 굉장히 심플하면서도 어려운 말이 될 수도 있는데요 이 타이틀 안에 여러분들이 어떤 생각을 가지고 어떤 연구 결과로 어떤 내용을 썼다라고 하는지가 그리고 그것 중에서 가장 중요한 게 무엇이다라고 하는지가 담겨야만 합니다 어렵죠 예 타이틀은 너무너무 어렵습니다 타이틀을 작성하는 것은 정말 어떤 부분들을 작성하는 것보다 가장 어렵다고 생각합니다 저 자신도 그렇기 때문에 타이틀은 항상 논문을 제출하는 그 순간까지도 고민을 하고 있습니다 이게 모든 것을 결정할 수가 있기 때문에 그 타이틀에 대해서의 중요도를 가장 우선순위를 두고 항상 논문을 작성하고 있는 experimental section 을 작성하고 있는 중간에 있는 것입니다. experiment section 을 작성하고 있는 중간에 있는 것입니다. 중간에도, Conclusion을 작성하고 있는 마무리 단계에서도 항상 타이틀은 고민을 하고 있습니다. 이 타이틀이 적당한지, 이 타이틀이 많은 사람들의 관심을 끌 수 있는지, 이런 부분들을 생각을 가지고 많이 작성을 하고요. 그렇게 되면 이제 Author를 작성을 하는데, 이 Author 작성은 기본적으로 굉장히 기술적인 내용이기 때문에 여러분들이 연구하셨던 논문들을 본인들이 직접 작성을 하게 되면 First Author가 되는 것은 당연히 할 것이고, 지도교수님 혹은 같이 공동연구 하시는 교수님들이 Corresponding Author, 책임 저자로 등록이 되시게 됩니다. 그래서 이런 부분들은 누구나 다 아는 부분이니까 스킵을 하고요. 다음으로 중요한 게 타이틀이 정해지면 연구 논문이 굉장히 리미트된 워딩 몇 개 만 가지고 전부를 얘기를 하는 타이틀이 정해지고, 타이틀이 정해지고, 연구 논문이 굉장히 리미트된 워딩 몇 개만 가지고 전부를 얘기를 하는 타이틀이 정해지고, 그 타이틀을 읽고 보통 독자들은 Upstract만 읽습니다. Upstract을 먼저 읽습니다. Upstract을 먼저 읽을 때, Upstract에 읽고 아까 처음에 3강에서 말씀을 드렸던 것처럼 다른 리뷰어들과의 소통하는 과정에서 이 리뷰어가 Upstract만 읽었구나, 또는 전체를 다 잘 읽어줬구나 하는 내용들을 알아들을 수 있을 만큼 이 Upstract이 굉장히 중요하게 됩니다. 왜냐하면 타이틀에서 말을 했던 10개의 단어, 15개의 단어 정도를 가지고 100개 혹은 250개의 단어로 펼쳐내게 됩니다. 왜 중요한지, 무엇을 연구를 했는지, 그 연구 결과가 너무너무 이 소사이어티의 이 필드에 중요한지, 그래서 이 결과가 어떤 것을 의미하는지, 이 과정들을 담게 되는 Upstract은 여러분들이 쓰시는 전체 논문에서 타이틀 2에는, 타이틀 2에는, 제일 중요한 부분이라고 할 수 있겠습니다. 그리고 Upstract이 담고 있는 전체 내용을 제한되서 작성하고, 그 부분들에 대해서 Introduction에서는 왜 이런 연구를 했는지, 왜 이런 연구를, 다른 사람들이 해왔던 연구를 이야기를 하면서, Background, Literature, Reference를 가지고 얘기를 해서, 왜 이 Introduction에서는 As an Introduction, 이 연구를 해야 tienes this kind of research in order to understand, It was involved in destination operations. 해야만 했 는지, 본인들의 연구를 왜 해야만 했는지, problem definition이라든지, 문제 제기라든지, 그리고 문제점이라든지, 혹은 내가 하려고 했던 새로운 아이디어가 무엇이었는지 이런 것들을 상세하게 기술을 하게 됩니다. 그래서 introduction도 중요하죠. 그러면 introduction은 abstract보다는 한 3배에서 5배 정도의 길이로 작성을 하는 게 보통의 방식입니다. 그리고 materials하고 method section이 있습니다. 그래서 어떤 연구를 어떻게 진행을 했는지, 예를 들어서 재료이면 어떤 재료를 가지고 어떻게 분석을 했는지, 그리고 어떤 결과를 어떤 방식으로 해석을 했는지를 말씀을 하게 되는 부분들이 있습니다. 어쩌면 이것도 중요한데요. 제가 지금 말씀을 드리면서도 약간 어색 한 게 title도 중요하고 abstract도 중요하고 다 중요합니다. 그만큼 각각의 부분들이 담아야 되는 내용들이 다 다르기 때문에 모두 다 중요해질 수밖에 없는데요. result 부분은 여러분들이 굉장히 시간을 많이 들이게 됩니다. 예를 들어서 결과를 보여줄 때 가장 먼저 결과를 잘 보여줄 수 있는 방법은 그림이고 그래프이고 테이블일 수가 있죠. 예 맞습니다. 저의 경험을 보면, 제 경험을 말씀을 드리는 이유는 각각의 논문을 보는 방식, 논문을 선정하는 방식, 그리고 공부하는 방식이 각 개인마다 다 다르기 때문에 제 방법을 먼저 말씀을 드립니다마는 저는 논문을 볼 때 title과 abstract을 읽고 기본적으로는 이 연구 논문은 어떤 연구를 했구나, 그리고 어떤 결과가 있구나, 이 결과가 어떤 의미를 가지고 있다, 라는 거를 abstract까지 다 파악을 하게 됩니다. 그렇게 파악을 하고 이 연구 논문은 내가 읽어볼 시간을 들여서 읽어볼 가치가 있다, 없다를 결정을 하면 읽어볼 가치가 있다고 했을 때 가장 먼저 result 섹션으로 가서 저는 그림부터 봅니다. 테이블부터 보고요. 어떤 연구 결과들이 어떻게 측정이 되었는지 그리고 어떤 데이터가 있는지를 먼저 쳐다보게 됩니다. 그리고 그렇게 본 데이터들이 디테일한 데이터들이 나오게 되면 이 데이터들이 나의 주목을 끌게 되면 제가 result 부분에 기술되어 있는 문장들을 열심히 읽어봅니다. 그래서 이 result에서는 여러분들이 많은 독자들에게 읽히게 하려면 좋은 그림과 그리고 디테일한 데이터 들을 굉장히 선명하게 클리어하게 보여줄 수 있는 노력들이 들어가게 됩니다. 영어로 논문을 기술하는 것 위하여 여기에 어떻게 하면 데이터를 잘 보여줄지 노력이 또 들어가기 때문에 이 result 부분을 작성하시는 기간들이 매우 길고 지난한 노력들이 필요로 하게 됩니다. 그리고 나서 이 result 부분에서는 핵심적으로 어떻게 보여주면서 어떻게 전개를 해나갈지 꼭 고민을 하셔야 됩니다. 여기에 보여주는 몇 가지 규칙들이 있는데요. 그 규칙들 중에서도 가장 중요한 것은 1번입니다. 1번이 모든 것을 다 결정을 하고 있다고 생각을 하시면 됩니다. 이 1번에서 보여주는 것처럼 현재 본인들의 결과를 테이블이나 그림 그리고 그래프를 이용해서 얼마만큼 선명하게 설명을 보여 주고 있는지 그리고 피규어가 보통 논문에서 하나만 있지 않고요. 작게는 3개 많게는 여러분들이 결정하시기 나름입니다만 굉장히 많은 숫자의 그림이 있을 수도 있습니다. 1번부터 나오는 그림들에 언제 가장 중요한 데이터를 보여주고 어떤 기초 데이터부터 보여줄지 아니면 어떻게 가장 중요한 부분을 더 말을 하고 나중에 서포팅하는 데 이터들을 보여줄지 이런 로직에 관련해서 여러분들이 생각하고 있는 상상을 하고 있는 논문에 여러분들의 논문에 어떻게 펼쳐갈지를 로지컬하게 보여주는 게 그리고 그 로직을 설명할 때 매우 클리어하게 보여주는 게 굉장히 중요한 것 같습니다. 만약에 심사를 하는 도중에, 다른 사람과 소통을 하는 도중에 여러분들의 로직이 약간 뒤형켜 있게 되면 사람들이 읽는 도중에 아, 이거는 내가 소통을 하고 싶지 않아. 더는. 그렇게 되면 리뷰어들이나 레프리들이 리젝트를 주게 되는 가능성이 있고요. 아니면 웰오르그라이저되어 있지 않기 때문에, 잘 써져 있지 않기 때문에, 논문을 다시 써라, 하거나 리젝트를 다시 보내거나, seven을 다시 다시 시키기도 합니다. 이렇기 때문에 어떤 내용을 어떻게 말하는지를 다른 사람들이 쉽게 이해할 수 있게 만들어주는 게 매우 중요합니다. 그러려면 예로 들어서 네 번째 작성을 해놓은 것처럼 불필요한 데이터 필요가 없습니다. 왜냐하면 불필요한 데이터들을 그림을 그려서 나 연구 열심히 했고 많은 데이터들이 있습니다 라고 자랑을 하는 것은 정말 불필요합니다. 그 불필요 한 것까지 넣게 되면 이 로직이 망가지고 어쩌면 클리어링스가 떨어지게 됩니다. 그렇게 되면 논문을 읽고 논문을 만드는 입장 그리고 논문을 만들어진 논문을 읽는 입장에서는 매우 어려운 논문이 되기도 하고 그리고 그 어렵다고 생각을 하게 되면 많은 사람들이 또 다시 읽지 않고 인용을 하지 않고 하는 과정들이 되겠죠. 그러면 논문은 질이 떨어지기도 하는 거죠. 이렇다 보니 필요 없는 데이터들을 로직에 맞지 않게 선명하지 않게 제시를 하는 것은 꼭 피해야 되는 중요한 이유가 있습니다. 디스커션 부분인데요. 보통은 저와 같은 논문을 쓰는 방식은 리절트와 디스커션을 같이 얘기를 하기도 합니다. 데이터를 보여주고 그 데이터의 의미들을 왜 중요한지에 대해서 디스커션을 해줍니다. 디스커션을 하는 것은 어떤 의미인가요? 그 의미가 있는 데이터가 있다면, 그 부분을 어떻게 판단하는 말은 나는 쓰기만 하지만 다른 사람들은 읽고 그 중요도를 판단하고 생각을 하겠죠. 그러면서 맞다, 틀리다 그 자체로 고민을 하게 될 겁니다. 독자들은. 그렇기 때문에 그걸 서로 디스커션을 한다고 하게 되는 건데요. 왜 중요한지를 얘기를 해주는 게 중요합니다. 그러면 여러분들은 많은 데이터가 있기 때문에 어떤 부분들이 중요하다고 하는지 항상 많은 말을 하고자 합니다. 그렇지만 읽는 입장에서는 독자들이나 소통을 하고 있는 리뷰어, 레프리들 입장에서는 가장 중요한 게 뭔지를 먼저 파악을 하고 싶어 합니다. 가장 중요한 게 먼저 파악을 해야 하기 때문에 여러분들이 그 파악을 해야 되는 독자들을 생각해서 먼저 가장 중요한 부분을 하이라이트 시켜줘야만 하는 의무가 있습니다. 그리고 왜 이런 연구들을 해야 되는지. 왜냐하면 이런 연구들을 해서 많은 데이터들을 주고 그러면 어떤 워드가 가장 중요한지 여러분들이 그걸 써서 로직하게 말씀을 하게 됩니다. 여러분들의 생각을. 그래 서 여러분들의 생각을 다른 사람들과 소통을 하면서 중요도를 가장 탑에 놓는 것과 가장 바텀에 놓는 것을 잘 고민을 해 보시면 전장에서 말씀드렸던 것처럼 리젤트 부분을 어떻게 꾸밀지 결정이 돼 버리게 됩니다. 로지컬하게. 그런 로직의 뜻을. 그러한 로직의 뜻에 따라서 여러분들의 워딩도 정해지게 되고요. 어떤 포인트들에서 가장 클 리어하게 말을 할지 그리고 여러분들의 메인의 클레임이라고 하는 메인의 컨셉이라고 하는 게 타이틀에 담겨 있을 텐데요. 그 타이틀에 담겨 있는 게 얼마만큼 적절한지에 대해서 여러분들의 아이디어가 이 디스커션 부분에 대해서 부분에서 그것들을 다른 사람들에게 설득을 하는 과정들이 들어가게 됩니다. 이렇게 설득을 하는 discussion 부분에서 만약에 로직이 뒤틀려 있고 result 부분이 약간의 순서가 뒤바뀌어 있거나 하면 이 부분들을 정확히 전달을 하기가 어렵게 됩니다. 그렇기 때문에 무엇보다도 중요한 게 로지컬하게 그리고 클리어하게 작성을 하고 불필요하지 않고 정말 필요한 데이터만 로직하게 선명하게 보여주는 게 매우 중요하다고 할 수 있습니다. 그리고 테 이블하고 그래프인데요. 정말 많은 노력이 필요하다는 걸 잘 알고 있습니다. 어렵죠. 그런데 무엇보다도 자기의 데이터의 가장 중요한 부분이 무엇인지 빠짐없이 그리고 테크니컬하게 실수 없이 작성을 하는 여러 번의 데이터가 필요한 것입니다. 그래서 여러 번 쳐다보고 여러 번 고쳐가는 그런 과정들이 있을 수밖에 없습니다. 왜 그러냐면 이 안에 담기는 테이블이나 그래프 혹은 피규어에 담기는 것들은 여러분들이 그 논문을 쓰기까지 들였던 연구한 그 시간 동안 얻었던 데이터들 그리고 내용들을 심플하게 보여주는 여러분들의 정말 노력의 결정체이기 때문에 어쩌면 어쩌면요 여러분들이 기술하였던 영어 문장풀과 같은 데이터가 필요한 것입니다. 그래서 여러분들이 기술하였던 영어 문장풀과 같은 데이터가 필요한 것입니다. 그래서 여러분들이 기술하였던 영어 문장풀과 같은 데이터가 필요한 것입니다. 그래서 여러분들이 기술하였던 영어 문장풀과 같은 데이터가 필요한 것입니다. 그런데 어떤 사람 보다도 이 그래프가 더 중요할 수도 있습니다. 그런데 어떤 사람 보다도 이 그래프가 더 중요할 수도 있습니 다. 이렇게 한 번 생각을 해보시죠. 여러분들이 보시고 있고 공부하고 있는 텍스트북이 있습니다. 그 텍스트북에 실려 있는 그림들이 많이 있죠. 그 그림들은 어디에서 나왔을까요? 네 연구논문에서 나옵니다. 연구논문에서. 그러면 그 연구 논문에서 그렸던 오류가 있었다고 하면 텍스트북에 실릴까요? 아닙니다. 정말 중요하고 클리어하고 선명한 너무 좋은 여러분들의 떄문으로 왔습니다. 여러분들의 노력의 결정체가 정말로 텍스트북에 실릴 만큼 중요한 데이터라고 하면 여러분들이 만든 그 그림 그 자체가 책에 실리게 됩니다 그러면 여러분들의 명성과 이름은 후세대까지 평생 남게 되는 거였고요 여러분들이 죽어도 그렇기 때문에 이 그림 하나를 그리는 게 저는 대단히 중 요하다고 생각을 합니다 꼭 여러분들의 그림들이 논문에 실리는 그림들이 텍스트북에 실릴 만큼 좋은 연구 결과를 얻을 수 있기를 굉장히 희망을 하고 있습니다 그리고 마지막에 어크널리지먼트는 어떤 서포트를 받았다 예로 들어서 다른 사람들과 디스커션을 해서 어떤 도움을 받았다라든지 그리고 여러분들이 연구를 진행하는 데 있어서 경제적으로 연구 비율이 필요하잖아요 이 연구 비가 어떤 소스에 얻다 그리고 어떤 어떤 다른 도움들이 있었다 라는 것들을 뭐 그냥 뭐 기술을 하게 됩니다 이런 기술들은 어쩌면 대단히 윤리적으로 중요할 수 있습니다 기술적 이기는 하지만 윤리적으로 대단히 중요하기 때문에 여러분들이 논문 작성 하실 때 매우 중요하게 생각을 하셔야 할 부분 중에 하나입니다 마지막으로 레퍼런스 인데요 이 레퍼런스 는 어떻게 생각을 하면요 굉장히 쉽게 그냥 뭐 치부하고 아무것도 아닌 것처럼 치부하고 넘어갈 수도 있지만요 어떻게 보면 굉장히 잘 써야 되는 잘 만들어야 되는 부분이기도 합니다 왜냐면 여러분들이 보통 레퍼런스를 다는 것은 다른 사람들의 연구 결과를 먼저 인용을 하기 때문인데요 다른 사람들의 연구 결과가 본인의 연구 결과가 어떤 연구 결과가 아닌지에 대한 연구를 하기도 합니다 다른 사람들의 연구 결과와 관계가 없습니다 관계가 없는 데도 비슷한 재료로 했기 때문에 혹은 비슷한 필드에서 연구를 했기 때문에 괜찮다라고 생각을 하시고 레퍼런스를 잡아서 어딘가에 번호를 매겨 놓고 인트로덕션이나 뭐 리절트 부분에는 당연히 그 리절트 하고 관련이 있으니까 쓰셨겠지만 인트로덕션에 이 레퍼런스를 올려 놓으시면 만약에 관계가 없는데 올려 놓으셨다고 하면 굉장히 큰 문제가 될 수도 있습니다 어 이 레퍼런스에 관계가 없는데 올려 놓으셨다고 하면 굉장히 큰 문제가 될 수도 있습니다 어떤 문제가 되냐면 어 섬세한 리뷰어들 그리고 그런 리뷰어들이 인트로덕션까지 있게되는 케이스는 이 논문의 연구 결과가 괜찮다라고 판단을 했기 때문인데요 이 연구 결과를 초록을 읽고 그렇게 판단을 했으면 아 인트로덕션에서 왜 이 연구를 했는지 본인들이 문제 제기를 했거나 해결하고자 하는 내용들을 기술을 하셨던 것을 보고자 했을 겁니다 여러분들의 생각을 읽어보려고 그런데 아 여러분들의 생각을 읽어 보려고 그런데 그런데 아 여러분들의 생각을 읽어 보려고 그런데 이렇게 읽는 과정에서 여러분들의 생각을 읽는 과정에서 레퍼런스를 보면서 잘 알고 있는 레플이기 때문에 리뷰어이기 때문에 이 분야에서 이런 연구 결과의 중요도는 이거였는데 왜 이 연구 논문은 관계도 없는 이런 레퍼런스를 선택을 했을까 라고 해버릴 수도 있습니다 그렇게 되면 읽는 입장에서 소통을 하고 있는 입장에서 디스커션 부분 그리고 결과 부분에서도 한번 말씀을 언급을 드렸습니다만 불필요한 내용이 들어가 버리게 됩니다 이 불필요한 내용이 들어가 버리면 읽는 입장에서는 이거 이상한데 라는 생각을 해버리게 됩니다 이상하거나 또는 이거 잘 읽히지 않는데 라는 생각을 하게 됩니다 그렇게 되면 이 연구 논문에 여러분들의 노력이 판단을 받을 때 평가를 받을 때 약간 좀 떨어지게 됩니다 그래서 레퍼런스는요 레퍼런스를 쓰는 방법은 각 연구 저널마다 다 다르기는 하지만 공통된 것은 여러분들이 왜 레퍼런스를 해야만 하는지 그 연구 논문을 인용을 해야 되는 이유와 함께 이 연구에서 했던 연구 결 과보다 본인의 연구 결과가 왜 새로운지 그거를 강력하게 표현을 할 수 있는 방법이 되기 때문에 레퍼런스는 정말 잘 고르시고 제대로 된 레퍼런스를 고르셔서 꼭 좋은 기술 내용과 함께 기술을 할 수 있도록 노력을 해야 합니다 이렇게 많은 내용들을 가지고 논문을 작성을 하게 되고 중요도를 따져서 각각의 부분들을 작성을 하게 되는데요 말씀드렸던 것처럼 가장 중요한 부분은 로지컬하게 어떻게 설명을 할지 입니다 로직을 가지고 어떻게 설명을 할지는 여러분들이 스토리텔링 하는 방법에서 결정이 됩니다 그래서 무엇보다도 중요한 게 논문을 쓰실 때 먼저 고민을 하실 것은 스토리텔링 입니다 어떻게 내 연구를 이야기를 풀어 갈지 예를 들어서 여러분들 친구들과 함께 자 기 연구에 대해서 디스커셜 하거나 소개해 주는 시간이 있다라고 치면 굉장히 긴 시간 동안 연구 논문을 시간을 들여서 썼습니다 그거를 여러분들이 소개를 할 때 그 시간과 똑같이 소개를 할 수는 없죠 그러면 보통은 생각을 하는 게 나는 이래 이래 이런 것들이 부족해서 혹은 대단해서 따라 해 보려고 했거나 부족했기 때문에 극복해 보려고 했거나 이런 내용들을 논리적으로 이야기를 하실 겁니다 그 논리적으로 이야기를 하시는 방법이 바로 스토리텔링 인데요 이 스토리텔링은 쓰고 난 다음에 하는 게 아니지요 쓰기 전에 고민을 해야 되는 거죠 고민을 해서 썼기 때문에 그 스토리텔링을 서서 그 스토리텔링을 읽고 나서 그 스토리텔링을 소개할 때는 가능해집니다 그러면 아카데믹 페이퍼에서는 이 스토리텔링을 어떻게 하는지에 대해서 한번 알아보겠습니다 여러 가지 타입이 있습니다 스토리텔링 하는 방법은 정말 다양하고요 정해진 규칙이라는 거는 없습니다 그렇지만 정해진 규칙이 없는 이유는 계속해서 말씀을 드리지만 사람 대 사람으로서 얘기를 하고 대화를 하는 게 논문이기 때문이죠 그런데 몇 가지 타입이 있죠? 약간 분류를 해 보면 전형적인 방법이 있기도 하고요 또는 굉장히 극적으로 쓰는 방법이 있습니다 드라마도 스토리텔링의 연속이죠 드라마도 어쩔 때는 밋밋하지만 쭉 이어지는 드라마가 있고 굉장히 급하게 드라마틱하게 전개되는 드라마도 있습니다 그거하고 똑같이 여러분들이 취사 선택을 하시면 됩니다 왜냐하면 여러분들이 직접 작성을 하는 여러분들의 작가이기 때문이죠 그리고 또 하나는요 매거진 스타일 보통은 매거진과 페이퍼, 사이언티픽, 저널 페이퍼에 약간 혼동이 있을 수도 있는데 매거진은 어느 누구나 다 읽으라고 하는 거죠 네이처나 사이언스 저널이 바로 매거진이라고 할 수가 있습니다 그래서 매거진 스타일은 조금은 하이 임팩트 저널이고 그 매거진은 약간 방법이 좀 특이할 수도 있습니다 그렇지만 대부분 드라마틱하거나 일반적인 방법들에서 어떻게 스토리텔링을 만들어 갔는지를 보시면 매우 쉽게 여러분들의 스토리텔링을 만드실 수가 있습니다 이 10가지 부분, 타이틀에서부터 10가지 섹션들에서 가장 중요한 부분들을 말씀을 드리면서 리절트하고 디스커션 부분들에서 로직하게 말을 하는 게 중요하다고 말씀을 드렸는데요 그 로직이 바로 짧게 이 타이틀에 담겨져 있습니다 이 타이틀의 예시로는 그래핀이 트랜스페런트하고 플렉서블한 필드 에미션 디바이스가 되기를 바라면서 올 그래핀을 썼습니다 그래서 이 연구 논문의 주제를 보면, 제목을 보면 모든 게 함축되어 있습니다 이 연구 논문은 플렉서블하고 트랜스 페런트한 디바이스를 만들기 위해서 여러 디바이스들의 각각의 구성이 있지만 가능한 한 올 그래핀을 썼네 라는 생각을 하실 수도 있습니다 그러면 읽어보시면 제너럴한 컨셉이 먼저 나오지 않습니다 백그라운드부터 나옵니다 왜 이 연구의 배경부터 설명을 할까요? 연구의 배경은 이 분야가 어떤 분야에서 연구를 하는지를 어떤 부분에 속해 있는지를 결정을 해주기 때문입니다 그래서 누구나 다 쉽게 알 수 있는 누구나 정말 잘 알 수 있는 백그라운드부터 작성을 하게 됩니다 이 백그라운드는 여러분들 그래핀이라는 거는 잡지 기사에서도 알 수 있는 것입니다 그래서 누구나 다 쉽게 알 수 있는 누구나 정말 잘 알 수 있는 백그라운드부터 작성을 하게 됩니다 잡지 기사에서도 그리고 인터넷에서도 많이 들어보셨을 텐데요 그래핀은 어떤 거다 라고 설명을 해줍니다 너무나도 잘 알려 있지만 한번 언급을 하고요 언급을 할 때도 뭐가 중요하다고 언급을 하는 포인트들이 생깁니다 어떤 점이 중요했기 때문에 왜 이 분야가 중요하다고 하는지를 기술을 하게 되고요 그렇게 기술을 하면 약간 조금은 더 스페시피한 점이 생깁니다 조금은 더 스페시피해지는 리미트가 되어가는 필드가 백그라운드가 나오게 됩니다 큰 부분에 대해서 말을 하고 그 부분에서 중요한 것 중에 남들이 다 잘 알고 여러분들도 잘 알고 여러분들의 연구 결과와 조금 관련이 있는 백그라운드 이 부분에 대해서 얘기를 하게 됩니다 그렇게 되면서 여러분들의 연구 결과를 어떤 연구 결과가 있다라고 왜 했고 어떤 연구 결과가 있다라고 말할 수 있는 것입니다 왜 했고 어떤 연구 결과가 있는지를 설명을 다시 하게 되고요 그래서 이 연구는 어떻다라고 하고 마무리 짓는 아웃룩을 전체적으로 보여주는 이런 전형적인 백그라운드부터 끝까지 흐름을 가지고 쓰는 방법이 있기도 합니다 제가 선호하는 방법이 있습니다 드라마틱하게 구성을 하는 것은 어쩌면 여러분들에게 많은 연습을 요구하는 것입니다 드라마틱하게 구성을 하는 것은 어쩌면 여러분들에게 많은 연습을 요구하는 것입니다 드라마틱하게 구성을 하는 것은 어쩌면 여러분들에게 많은 연습을 요구하는 것입니다 드라마틱하게 구성을 하는 것은 어쩌면 여러분들에게 많은 연습을 요구하는 것입니다 이 연습은 대단히 중요하다고 생각을 해서 꼭 한번 연습을 해 보시도록 권유를 드리겠습니다 이 연습은 대단히 중요하다고 생각을 해서 꼭 한번 연습을 해 보시도록 권유를 드리겠습니다 비슷한 주제를 가지고 연구한 논문입니다 Nature에 투고가 돼서 Publish가 된 논문인데요 보시면 매우 잘 썼습니다 보시면 매우 잘 썼습니다 매우 잘 쓴 게 이유는 그래핀이라고 하는 단어부터 끝까지 피겨까지 읽히는 데 있어서 무리가 없습니다 매우 잘 쓴 게 이유는 그래핀이라고 하는 단어부터 끝까지 피겨까지 읽히는 데 있어서 무리가 없습니다 여러분들은 읽으면서 생각을 하실 때 여러분들은 읽으면서 생각을 하실 때 아 이거는 어떤 백그라운드를 가지고 있구나 다 아시게 되죠 이것들은 대충해서 그냥 넘어갈 수도 있는데 여기 하이라이트 해 놓은 것처럼 이런 단어들을 쓰고 각각의 부분들을 쓴 것은 전장에서 말했던 이 잘 알려진 백그라운드에 대신하는 부분이 될 수도 있습니다 그래서 이런 부분들에 대해서 기술을 하고 나면 보통은 이렇게 드라마틱하게 작성을 하는 데 있어서는 이 전에 연구들에서 핵심적인 부분들만 간략하게 소개를 하게 됩니다 핵심적인 부분들을 소개를 하는 이유는요 하이 임팩트 저널에서 이 전에 연구들 중에서 가장 좋았던 연구들을 소개를 하는 게 되겠죠 핵심적이기 때문에 가장 좋았을 거고 그 연구 결과에 대해서 설명을 하면 왜 이렇게 나의 페이퍼가 나의 연구 결과가 좋은 논문이 되어야 하는지에 대해서 말을 하게 됩니다 왜 이렇게 나의 페이퍼가 나의 연구 결과가 좋은 논문이 되어야 하는지에 대해서 말을 하게 됩니다 왜 이렇게 나의 페이퍼가 나의 연구 결과가 좋은 논문이 되어야 하는지에 대해서 말을 하게 됩니다 이 말하는 방법이 이런 드라마틱한 디스크립션의 방법에서는 제게 좋습니다 라고만 할건지 제 연구 결과가 대단합니다 라고 하면 그래 니가 대단하니까 여기 냈겠지 라고만 리뷰들은 생각을 하게 되죠 그렇지만 보통은 이런 식으로 이 연구 결과들 이전에 행해졌던 가장 좋은 연구 결과와 함께 이 전에 기술들이나 과학적인 사실들의 리미테이션, 기술의 무리, 기술의 기술의 미래가 되어야 하는 것입니다 이 전에 기술들이나 과학적인 사실들의 리미테이션, 기술의 미래가 되어야 하는 것입니다 혹은 문제점을 지적을 할 수가 있습니다 왜 지적을 하시겠습니까? 본인들이 해결했기 때문이죠 본인들이 해결을 했고 극복을 했기 때문이죠 그러면 일반적인 사실과 함께 가장 좋은 연구 결과를 말을 하고 그리고 그 문제점을 지적을 하면 나는 어떠어떠한 연구를 어떠어떠한 결과를 얻었다 라고 간략하게만 써도 이렇게 중요한 연구 분야에서 이렇게 중요한 연구 결과가 되어야 하는 것입니다 이렇게 중요한 연구 분야에서 이런 연구 결과가 있었는데 이것을 다 극복을 했다고 하네 어떤 문제점이 있어서 그러면 여러분들의 아이디어가 담겨 있을 수도 있고요 이 노란색으로 하이라이트 한 부분에서는 그리고 아주 중요한 연구 결과가 담겨 있을 수도 있습니다 이렇게 되면 모든 읽는 독자들이 쉽게 더 극적으로 접근을 할 수가 있죠 왜냐하면 이 부분 때문입니다 기존의 연구 결과들의 내용 중에 여러분들이 파악을 하셔서 문제점이 뭐다라고 알고 계신다면 정말 대단한 겁니다 아주 중요한 연구 결과에서도 문제가 있다 혹은 극복해야 되는 점이 있다 라고 하는 것은 정말 정말 대단한 겁니다 칭찬을 받아 마땅하죠 근데 그런 부분을 해결을 했다고 하면 너무나 대단합니다 그 대단함을 표현을 하게 되는 것이기 때문에 쉽게 처음부터 필드부터 이렇게 기술을 하는 것과 이렇게 문제가 있는 부분에 대해서 지적을 하고 그 부분을 극복했다고 하면서 내가 어떤 것을 했습니다 라고 짧게 기술을 하는 게 어쩌면 더 효과적일 수도 있습니다 다음은 비슷한 연구 분야에서의 다른 포맷의 스토리텔링인데요 보통 문제가 있다고 이렇게 지적을 했던 페이퍼 같이 이렇게 지적을 했다고 하면 이런 것들이 쓰는 방식도 있고요 다르게 모티베이션을 잘 서술을 하는 연구 논문들도 있습니다 모티베이션을 서술을 하면서 다른 연구 이전의 연구 결과들에 대해서 문제가 있다 라고 얘기를 하기보다는 왜 이 연구 를 해야지만 이 분야에서 어떤 연구가 앞으로 더 왜 이런 연구가 중요해질지에 대해서 담담하게 모티베이션을 하는 것입니다 모티베이션을 얘기를 하는 게 대단히 중요하죠 그렇게 되면 꼭 과학적으로 또는 사이언티픽하게 엔지니어링하게 중요한지 니즈가 있는지 어떤 니즈 때문인지를 말씀을 하게 됩니다 이런 말을 기술을 하면서 왜 어드 밴티지가 있는지 그리고 왜 이런 것들이 이 논문이 이 주제가 되면서 적절한 주제가 되는지에 대해서 여러분들이 말을 하게 되죠 그래서 매거진에서는 보통은 트렌디한 연구 논문들이 많습니다 트렌디하다는 말은 패션이 있는 연구들에 대해서 가장 좋은 결과들을 어떤 요구가 있었기 때문에 작성을 하게 될 것이기 때문이죠 그래서 이렇게 스토리텔링 하는 방법들이 여러 가지가 있기 때문에 본인들의 연구 결과가 어느 정도의 시그니피션스를 가지고 있고 그 시그니피션스를 얘기하는 방식을 본인들이 결정을 하시게 됩니다 그래서 결정을 하는 방법에 있어서는 여러분들의 자유지만 결정을 하고 말을 하는 그리고 글로 보여주는 방법은 소통을 하는 거라는 것을 꼭 기억을 해 두시고 그 소통에 있어서 어떤 점이 로직하게 말해서 그 소통을 부드럽게 하고 더 쉽게 내 연구 결과를 잘 전달하기 위한 방법들을 꼭 선택을 하셔야 됩니다 다른 스토리텔링의 방법들은 다른 스토리텔링의 방법들은 또 하나는 연구 논문 그러니까 여러분들이 쓰시고 학기 과정에서 쓰시는 This is style이 있죠 그렇게 되면 또 똑같이 비슷하 게 모티베이션이 적어져 있고요 그리고 어드밴티지 그리고 왜 이 연구 논문이 적절한지 이렇게 적어지는 그 과정들이 있습니다 그래서 말씀드렸던 것처럼 스토리텔링의 방법은 여러분들이 직접 연구 결과를 무엇이 제일 중요했겠는지 무엇이 제일 중요했겠는지에 대한 연구 결과를 직접 연구해 주셔야 됩니다 무엇이 제일 중요했기 때문에 그 무엇을 어떻게 보여줄지를 결정을 하시게 되면 자연스럽게 결정이 되는 것이니까요 잘 결정을 해서 전체 타이틀부터 끝까지 잘 작성을 하시길 바랍니다 그러면 얼마나 많은 데이터를 가지고 하는지 잠깐 기술적인 내용에 대해서 말씀을 드리겠습니다 다음 강좌에서 말을 하겠지만 연구 논문은 많은 다양한 타입들이 있습니다 다양한 타입들 이 있습니다 레터라든지 그리고 풀페이퍼 아티클이라든지 있게 되는데요 이런 논문들에 마다 요구하는 스콥과 기준들이 있고 내용들의 길이가 있습니다 그것들은 각각의 잡지에 들어가 보시면 본인의 연구 결과를 어떻게 말할지에 대해서 생각을 하셨을 때 그 스콥과 함께 그 연구 각각의 논문들에 대해서 잘 설명이 되어 있기 때문에 한번 보시고요 요즘에 들어서 왜 이렇게 변해 왔는지를 말씀을 드리면 여러분들이 어떻게 논문을 작성하게 되는지가 한번 더 고민을 해 볼 점이 생기게 됩니다 오래전부터 지금까지 변화한 건데요 간단한 추이를 보시면 요즘에는 메인 피규어가 개수가 매우 작습니다 메인 피규어의 개수가 작고 서포팅의 피규어의 개수가 굉장히 많습니다 요즘의 논문들은 대충 그렇습니다 왜 그러냐면 정말 많은 논문들이 출판이 되고 많은 연구자들이 많은 논문들을 작성을 하기 때문에 그 모든 논문들을 다 실을 수가 없고 많은 논문들을 다 읽을 수도 없기 때문에 메인 피규어 정말 중요한 피규어들만 잡지에 실고 그 잡지에서 서포팅에 대한 이 메인 피규어들을 서포팅할 수 있는 정말 많은 데이터 들은 중요도는 좀 떨어지지만 이 메인 피규어의 개수가 정말 많습니다 그래서 이 메인 피규어들을 설명을 하기 위해서는 중요한 데이터이기 때문에 싫겠다고 하더라도 정말 많은 백데이터가 필요하게 되는 거죠 그래서 이 많은 백데이터는 보통은 다른 다큐먼트로 그냥 인터넷에서 다운을 받을 수 있고 메인 논문에는 안 나오기도 합니다 그 렇지만 리뷰어들 입장에서 그리고 소통을 하는 입장에서 메인 피규어만 가지고 쉽게 이해가 되지 않은 현상 이런 결과들에 대해서는 항상 서포팅을 정말로 이게 혁신적인 결과이고 새로운 결과인지에 대해서 서포팅의 피규어로부터 또 판단을 하게 되기 때문에 메인 피규어처럼 많은 서포팅의 피규어도 메인 피규어에 들이는 노력처럼 서포팅 피규어에도 많은 노력을 들이셔서 많은 연구자들이 리뷰어들이 레프리들이 잘 판단을 하고 본인의 연구 결과를 할 수 있게 넘어가는 추세로 바뀌고 있습니다 메인 피규어를 이렇게 몇 개를 고르는 것은 그 과정이라고 하는 것은 결국에는 제가 말씀드렸던 것처럼 어떤 로직을 가지고 얼마만큼의 선명도를 가지고 본인의 연구 결과를 잘 설명해 줄 수 있는지에 따라서 개수도 결정이 되고 순서도 결정이 되게 됩니다 그 순서의 개수의 결정에 따라서 서포팅의 개수와 서포팅의 순서도 결정이 되게 되겠죠 그래서 많은 데이터들을 준비를 할 때 로직을 가지고 선명성을 어떻게 보여줄지를 많이 고민을 하셔야 하는 이유가 되겠습니다 그래서 이런 페이퍼들을 어떻게 퍼블리싱 해가는 지에 대해서는 이제 다시 5강에서도 말씀을 드리겠지만 기본적으로 간단한 프로세스를 말씀을 드리겠습니다 여러분들이 준비를 하시고요 준비를 하시면 투고를 하게 됩니다 투고를 했을 때 커버레터라고 하는 이 연구 논문은 본인들이 제시를 하셨던 투고를 하셨던 연구 논문들은 10장 혹은 20장일 수도 있고 그보다 많을 수도 있습니다 이 모든 것들을 각각 잡지의 에디터들이 다 읽지는 않습니다 어렵죠 읽기가 어떤 중요도를 가지고 있는지 빨리 파악을 하고자 합니다 그렇게 빨리 파악을 하고자 하는 것을 도와줘야 되겠죠 도와주려면 커버레터를 작성을 하게 됩니다 그래서 많은 잡지들이 커버레터를 요구를 하고 있죠 그래서 말씀드렸던 논문 전체를 작성하는 거에서도 타이 틀도 중요하다고 하지 업스트랙도 중요하다고 하지 다 중요하다고 하면서도 저는 개인적으로 강조드리는 것 중에 하나는 이 커버레터는 그 무엇보다도 더 중요할 수도 있습니다 여러분들이 열심히 작성을 하셔서 정말 좋은 논문을 작성을 하셨는데 투고를 하고 에디터가 요구하는 커버레터를 작성을 해서 왜 이 논문을 작성하는데 너무 힘들 어서 어느 정도만 작성을 해서 냈더니 이렇게 좋은 페이퍼를 한순간에 24시간 안에 혹은 리젝을 시켜버린다 에디터가 그러면 정말 정말 디프레스 될 거 아닙니까 그러면 이 커버레터가 그거를 결정해 버리게 된다면 이 커버레터를 얼마만큼 더 노력을 해서 작성을 해야 될지 고민을 해 보실 필요가 있습니다 그래서 이 커버레터 작성은 전체 논문을 작성하는 것입니다 그래서 이 커버레터 작성은 전체 논문을 작성하는 것입니다 그래서 이 커버레터 작성은 전체 논문을 작성하는 것입니다 전체 논문을 작성하는 것과 함께 저는 많은 시간을 들이고 그 많은 수만자의, 수천자의, 수천자의 단어들을 정말 함축을 해서 나타낼 수 있는 한 페이지 혹은 두 페이지의 문서로 작성을 하게 됩니다 왜 중요하고 아까 스토리텔링을 말씀드렸던 것처럼 백그라운드도 얘기하고 이 결과를 또 얘기하고 그 것들을 문단으로도 얘기하지 않고 문단을 넣어서 말하는 것도 중요합니다 그 것들을 문단으로도 얘기하지 않고 문단으로도 말하는 것도 중요합니다 그 것들을 문단으로도 얘기하지 않고 문단을 넣어서 말하는 것도 중요합니다 한두 문장으로 얘기하는 이 커버레터의 중요성은 정말로 정말로 중요하기 때문에 잘 작성을 하시기를 바랍니다. 그래서 에디터가 이 커버레터를 보고 이 내용들을 확인을 하고요. 좋다고 하면 리뷰 프로세스를 가겠죠. 리뷰 프로세스에서 코멘트가 오고요. 에디터가 그 코멘트를 보고 여러분들에게 리스폰스를 줍니다. 이 리스폰스를 줄 때 리젝이 될 수도 있고, 리바이스를 하라고 할 수도 있고, 또는 accept 바로 as is로 올 수도 있습니다. 그렇지만 보통의 경우에는 리바이스 과정을 겪습니다. 이 리바이스 리비전하는 과정을 겪고 나서 에디터가 마지막으로 여러분들의 논문은 accept이다, 아니다라고 결정을 하게 될 텐데요. 이 과정에서 굉장히 많은 시간이 지체가 됩니다. 이 과 정이. 이 과정에서 리비전이 아니고, 리젝이었을 때는 여러분들은 받아들이실지, 아니면 잘못 리뷰를 했기 때문에 여러분들이 파이트를 하실지, 싸울지, 아니면 설득을 할지 결정을 하시게 되고, 이 에디터를 통해서 소통을 하시게 됩니다. 이 과정이 너무너무 길고 어렵기 때문에 커버레터, 이 서브미션 하는 단계, 그리고 서브미션 하기 위한 논문을 작성하는 단계에서 이 기간을 줄이기 위해서는, 이 기간을 줄이기 위해서는, 이 기간을 줄이기 위해서는, 잘 작성을 하고, 쉽게 작성을 하고, 클리어하게 작성을 해야 되는 필요가 있습니다. 그래서 퍼블리싱을 할 때 보통은 이렇게 짧게 커버레터를 쓰기도 하고요. 아주 간략하게 쓰죠. 보통은. 이 간략하게 쓰는 게 매우 어렵다 는 걸 잘 알고 있습니다. 매우 어렵습니다마는, 여러분들이 앞으로 연구 논문을 많이 쓰시게 되면, 이 콘사이즈하고 로지컬하게, 또는 클리어하게 작성하시게 되, 해야만 합니다. 그래서 이런 것들은 많은 연구 논문들을 읽으실 때도, 어떻게 해서 클리어런스를 줬구나, 어떻게 해서 로지컬하게 했구나를 잘 한번 생각해 보실 필요가 있습니 다. 그래서 이렇게 커버레터를 작성을 하고 나면, 이런 시스템을 통해서 서브미션을 하고요. 서브미션 한 결과가, 이렇게 코멘트로 리뷰어 1은 무슨 말을 했고, 2는 무슨 말을 했고, 그래서 전체 2에 대해서 우리의 리스폰스는 뭐다라고 말씀을 하게 됩니다. 이 리스폰스에서 리뷰어 1의 내용은 하나하나 어떤 점이 맞고, 어떤 점은 잘못됐고, 어떤 점은 요구하는 내용들을 정확히 다시 한번 실험을 해서, 혹은 생각을 해서 보여줬습니다라고 길게 기술을 합니다. 보통은 설득을 해야 되니까요. 소통을 해야 되고, 대면하고 있는 경우는, 말로만 하면 좋을 텐데, 보통은 리뷰어가 누군지 잘 모르시죠? 당연히 몰라야만 하는 거고요. 요즘에는 알게 해주는 저널도 있습니다만, 모르기 때문에 정확하게 저 사람의 생각을 파악을 하고, 우리가 리스폰스 레터를 작성을 하게 됩니다. 이렇게 작성을 해서 겨우 퍼블리시가 되고, 그게 1년 혹은 2년, 혹은 또 3, 4년 걸릴 수도 있습니다. 이 많은 고난의 기간을 짧게 하기 위해, 이 많은 고난의 기간을 짧게 하기 위해, 여러분들이 가장 중요하게 생각해야 될, 어떻게 스토리텔링 을 해 갈지, 그리고 나의 연구 결과를 어느 논문에 작성을 하게 할지, 고민해서 좋은 논문을 쓰도록 해야 할 것 같습니다. 이 정도로 4강을 마치고요. 다음 5강과 6강에서부터는, 매우 기술적인 내용에 대해서 다시 말씀을 드리도록 하겠습니다. 감사합니다. 감사합니다.","output":"1주차 강의의 핵심 요약: 성균관대학교 공과대학 산업공학과 노상도 교수님의 대학원생을 위한 학술 논문 작성법 및 연구윤리 과목 소개입니다. 이 강의는

Это может быть файл или набор файлов в форматах, таких как CSV, JSON, Parquet или даже директория с текстовыми файлами. Подробнее о поддерживаемых форматах и как загрузить свой датасет, можно узнать в документации [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading_datasets.html#local-and-remote-files). 2. **Структура датасета**: Основываясь на примере, структура датасета должна содержать поля \`title\`, \`content\`, и \`all_labels\`. \`all_labels\` содержит метки, разделенные запятой, представляющие классы, к которым относится пример. Убедитесь, что ваш датасет имеет похожую структуру или измените функцию \`preprocess_function\`, чтобы она соответствовала вашей структуре. 3. **Загрузка вашего датасета**: Если ваш датасет локальный, вы можете использовать прямой путь к нему или относительный путь от текущей рабочей директории. Пример для CSV файла: \`\`\`python dataset = load_dataset('csv', data_files={'train': 'path_to_your_train_dataset.csv', 'test': 'path_to_your_test_dataset.csv'}) \`\`\` Этот код загрузит ваш датасет из указанных файлов, распознавая их как части для обучения и тестирования. 4. **Адаптация препроцессинг функции**: Функция \`preprocess_function\` обрабатывает данные и подготавливает их к тренировке модели. Если ваш датасет имеет другую структуру, измените эту функцию так, чтобы она соответствовала вашим данным. Например, если у вас нет поля \`title\`, вы можете использовать только \`content\` для анализа. 5. **Метки классов**: Убедитесь, что все метки классов в вашем датасете хорошо определены и соответствуют тем, что описаны в начале кода (\`classes\`, \`class2id\`, \`id2class\`). После этих изменений, код должен работать с вашим датасетом.

Вот пошаговое описание того, что делает эта функция: 1. **Конкатенация заголовка и содержимого**: Функция начинается с создания единого текстового блока \`text\`, который состоит из заголовка \`example['title']\`, за которым следует содержимое \`example['content']\`, разделенное точкой и переводом строки. Это обычная практика при работе с текстовыми данными, где заголовок и содержимое могут давать ценную информацию для задачи классификации или других задач NLP (Natural Language Processing, Обработка естественного языка). 2. **Разделение меток**: Строка \`all_labels\`, предположительно содержащая метки, разделенные запятыми и пробелами, разделяется методом \`.split(', ')\` на список \`all_labels\`, где каждый элемент списка является отдельной меткой. Это необходимо для дальнейшего создания вектора меток. 3. **Формирование вектора меток**: Создается список \`labels\`, длина которого равна количеству классов (\`len(classes)\`), и все его элементы инициализируются нулями. Это представление используется для указания отсутствия или присутствия конкретных меток для данного примера. Для каждой метки из \`all_labels\` определяется соответствующий индекс (\`label_id\`) с помощью словаря \`class2id\`, который сопоставляет каждую метку с ее уникальным идентификатором. Для каждой метки в \`labels\` по соответствующему индексу значение устанавливается в 1, что указывает на присутствие метки. 4. **Токенизация**: В созданный текстовый блок \`text\` применяется токенизатор (определенный в \`tokenizer\`), который преобразует текст в формат, подходящий для входных данных модели машинного обучения. Процесс токенизации включает разбиение текста на токены (например, слова или части слов), преобразование их в уникальные целочисленные идентификаторы и другие потенциальные шаги, такие как укорачивание текста до максимально допустимой длины с помощью параметра \`truncation=True\`. 5. **Добавление меток к примеру**: К результату токенизации добавляется ключ \`labels\` с ранее подготовленным вектором меток \`labels\`. Таким образом, преобразованный пример будет содержать как обработанный текст, так и соответствующие метки классов в виде вектора. 6. **Возвращение измененного примера**: Функция возвращает обогащенный пример с токенизированным текстом и метками классов для дальнейшего использования, например, при обучении или оценивании модели. Функция \`preprocess_function\` представляет собой типичный этап предварительной обработки в процессе подготовки текстовых данных к обучению моделей NLP, обеспечивая преобразование исходных данных к формату, необходимому для входных данных модели."},{"instruction":"У меня метки представлены столбцами с 0 и 1, где 1 ставится если эта метка соответсвует классу, как мне преобразовать эту функцию","output":"Если метки в вашем датасете уже представлены в виде столбцов с 0 и 1, где каждый столбец соответствует определённому классу, и значения 1 указывают на принадлежность примера к этому классу, то предварительная обработка данных будет немного отличаться.

Ошибка возникает из-за несоответствия типов данных между выходом модели и метками целевых данных. В контексте многоэтикетной классификации с помощью бинарной кросс-энтропии (используемой часто для множественной классификации), PyTorch ожидает, что метки (цели) будут в формате \`float\`, тогда как некоторые операции или настройки могли привести к тому, что метки были преобразованы в \`long\`. # Решение проблемы Вам нужно убедиться, что и выходы модели, и метки целевых данных передаются в функцию потерь в правильном типе данных. Для множественной классификации с бинарной кросс-энтропией метки должны быть \`float\`. Если вы используете пользовательскую функцию для вычисления метрик (\`compute_metrics\` в вашем коде), проверьте, что метки преобразуются в \`float\` перед передачей их в функцию потерь. Это можно сделать, используя метод \`.float()\` в PyTorch: \`\`\`python def compute_metrics(eval_pred): logits, labels = eval_pred preds = np.argmax(logits, axis=1) # Убедимся, что метки в формате float labels = labels.float() # Ваш код для вычисления метрик... \`\`\` Если проблема возникает в самой функции потерь, убедитесь, что целевые метки передаются как \`float\`.

Если ошибка возникает при вызове \`trainer.train()\`, вам возможно потребуется изменить способ подготовки меток в вашей функции препроцессинга или в функции, которая генерирует пакеты данных (\`batch\`).

Эта ошибка может возникать в различных контекстах, но основным ее источником является попытка использования целевых данных (\`target\`), чей тип данных не соответствует ожидаемому типу, указанному в функции потерь.

В контексте использования \`Trainer\` от Hugging Face, это часто делается в пользовательской функции вычисления метрик. Если ваша ошибка возникает во время обучения, скорее всего, необходимо изменить препроцессинг данных или же определение модели. Вот несколько подходов к решению: # 1. Изменение формата меток перед обучением Убедитесь, что ваши метки представлены в виде тензоров с плавающей запятой. Если у вас есть шаг препроцессинга данных, в который метки преобразуются из списка или массива Numpy в тензоры PyTorch, укажите правильный тип данных: \`\`\`python import torch # Предполагая, что labels - это ваш список или массив меток labels_tensor = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.float) \`\`\` # 2. Приведение типа в функции вычисления метрик Если вычисления метрик включают в себя операции с предсказаниями модели и истинными метками, убедитесь, что истинные метки приводятся к типу \`float\`. Однако подход с изменением типов непосредственно в функции вычисления метрик может не подходить если ошибка возникает до ее вызова, например, в процессе обучения. # 3. Проверка модели на соответствие задаче Убедитесь, что ваша модель настроена на соответствие целям вашей задачи. Например, для бинарной классификации с \`binary_cross_entropy_with_logits\` в вашей модели последний слой должен использовать функцию активации, соответствующую этой функции потерь (т.е., logit или линейный выход без активации). Если вам известно имя места в коде, где возникает ошибка, конкретное решение будет зависеть от контекста этого участка.

NSE is a marker often associated with neuroendocrine tumors as well as small cell lung cancer (SCLC), whereas ProGRP is more specifically a marker for SCLC among neuroendocrine tumors. Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that arises from glandular tissue and can occur in various organs, including the lungs, colon, pancreas, and breast. While NSE can sometimes be elevated in non-small cell lung cancers (including adenocarcinomas), it is not as commonly associated with these cancers as it is with neuroendocrine tumors. Carcinoid tumors, on the other hand, are a subset of neuroendocrine tumors that can secrete various substances such as serotonin and occasionally, though less commonly, can cause an increase in NSE as well. However, the secretion of ProGRP by carcinoid tumors is less common, with this marker being more specific for SCLC, as mentioned above. In summary, it is relatively uncommon for either adenocarcinomas or carcinoid tumors to raise NSE and ProGRP simultaneously. These markers are more indicative of SCLC. If both NSE and ProGRP are elevated, it might suggest a neuroendocrine characteristic of the cancer, possibly pointing toward a small cell lung cancer diagnosis rather than a typical adenocarcinoma or a classic carcinoid tumor. However, the elevation of these markers alone is not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis, and further diagnostic procedures, including histopathological examination, are essential for accurate cancer typing."},{"instruction":"What are the other specific cancers exhibit raise of both nse and progrp?","output":"Elevation of both neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) levels is most closely associated with neuroendocrine characteristics, particularly in lung cancers. However, these markers can be elevated in a range of neuroendocrine tumors beyond small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Here’s a broader look at the context in which both markers may be elevated: # Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) - **SCLC:** This is the primary cancer type where both NSE and ProGRP are elevated together. SCLC is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that is highly aggressive and is known for its rapid growth and early spread. ProGRP is considered more specific for SCLC among neuroendocrine markers. # Other Neuroendocrine Tumors - **Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC):** Although less common than SCLC, LCNEC can also show elevated levels of these markers due to its neuroendocrine nature. LCNEC is a type of lung cancer that shares some pathological characteristics with SCLC but exhibits a distinctly different large cell size under microscopic examination. - **Merkel Cell Carcinoma:** This rare skin cancer with neuroendocrine features may also present elevated levels of NSE and, less commonly, ProGRP. Merkel cell carcinoma is aggressive and tends to spread quickly. - **Other High-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinomas:** Various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and bladder can be origins for high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Depending on the degree of neuroendocrine differentiation, these tumors might also elevate NSE and ProGRP levels to some extent. # Additional Contexts While significantly elevated levels of NSE and ProGRP are strongly suggestive of neuroendocrine origin, particularly pointing towards SCLC, it’s important to note that these markers are not entirely exclusive and might be elevated in other conditions or tumors with neuroendocrine features. The context of elevated levels of these markers, along with other clinical and diagnostic findings, must be considered to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. Finally, elevated tumor markers alone are not definitive for diagnosis; they must be interpreted in conjunction with imaging studies, histopathological examination, and clinical presentation. It’s also vital to understand that not all neuroendocrine tumors will necessarily elevate both markers significantly, and the absence of elevated markers does not rule out the disease."},{"instruction":"Statistically, what's the likelihood of one being diagnosed with cancer upon elevation of both nse and progrp.","output":"The specific statistical likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer based solely on the elevation of both neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) without considering other clinical information and diagnostic results is difficult to quantify accurately. This is because the relevance of these markers is highly context-dependent, varying with factors such as the presence of symptoms, history, radiological findings, and the results of other laboratory tests. However, it is crucial to understand the following points when considering the elevation of these markers: 1. **High Specificity in Certain Contexts:** Both NSE and ProGRP are particularly associated with neuroendocrine tumors of the lung, especially small cell lung cancer (SCLC). ProGRP, in particular, has high specificity for SCLC. An elevation of both markers would substantially raise the suspicion of SCLC, especially in a patient with compatible symptoms (e.g., a smoker with new respiratory symptoms, weight loss) and radiological evidence of lung pathology. 2. **Other Neuroendocrine Tumors:** While the combination of elevated NSE and ProGRP is strongly suggestive of SCLC, other high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas can also present with elevations in these markers. Thus, the clinical context and differential diagnosis would extend to other sites where neuroendocrine tumors might arise. 3. **False Positives:** As with any tumor marker, there are potential false positives. Conditions other than cancer can sometimes cause elevated levels of these markers, though such instances are less common. Therefore, elevated markers should not be interpreted in isolation but with a full clinical workup. 4. **Lack of Absolute Values:** There are no absolute cut-off values beyond which the presence of cancer is confirmed or ruled out. The levels of these markers must be interpreted relative to the clinical scenario and other findings. Given these considerations, while an elevation in both markers increases the suspicion of a neuroendocrine tumor, notably SCLC, it does not automatically translate to a definitive cancer diagnosis. The likelihood of cancer would be higher in a patient with both elevated NSE and ProGRP, especially in the context of compatible symptoms and imaging findings suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor. However, definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy and pathological examination. In summary, while statistically significant correlations between elevated NSE, ProGRP, and certain cancers (especially SCLC) exist, a precise statistical likelihood of cancer based only on these elevations cannot be isolated without additional diagnostic contexts. Diagnostic accuracy improves significantly when these markers are used alongside a comprehensive clinical evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please elaborate on \\"other neuroendocrine tumours\\".","output":"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a diverse group of malignancies that originate from neuroendocrine cells throughout the body.

NETs can arise in various organs, displaying a wide range of behaviors, from indolent to highly aggressive, depending on their site of origin and histological features. Here's a closer look at some of the key types of neuroendocrine tumors outside of the well-known small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and their primary characteristics: # Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP-NETs) 1. **Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNETs):** - These arise in the pancreas and can produce a variety of hormones, leading to distinct clinical syndromes, depending on the hormone produced. Examples include insulinomas (insulin-producing), gastrinomas (gastrin-producing), and non-functional tumors. 2. **Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors:** - Found in organs such as the stomach, intestines, rectum, and appendix. They might produce serotonin and other substances, leading to carcinoid syndrome, characterized by flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing. # Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumors 1. **Typical and Atypical Carcinoids:** - These are generally less aggressive than SCLC and tend to grow and spread more slowly. They can occur in the lungs and may lead to symptoms due to local growth or hormone secretion (in some cases). # Merkel Cell Carcinoma - This is a rare and aggressive skin cancer that exhibits neuroendocrine features. It is known for its tendency to metastasize and its sensitivity to chemotherapy, although prognosis is often poor if not caught early. # Pheochromocytomas and Paragangliomas 1. **Pheochromocytomas:** - Tumors arising from the adrenal glands that often produce catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to symptoms such as hypertension, palpitations, and headaches. 2. **Paragangliomas:** - Similar to pheochromocytomas but located outside the adrenal glands, often along the spine. They can also secrete catecholamines. # Medullary Thyroid Cancer - This is a form of thyroid cancer originating from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid, which produce calcitonin. It has distinct clinical and genetic profiles compared to other types of thyroid cancers. # Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Syndromes - These are rare, inherited conditions leading to the development of multiple endocrine tumors, including NETs. MEN1, MEN2A, and MEN2B are the main types, each associated with different tumor profiles. # Diagnosis and Management The diagnosis of NETs often relies on a combination of imaging tests (CT, MRI, PET), biochemical markers (chromogranin A, hormone levels, NSE for some high-grade NETs), and histopathological examination of biopsy specimens. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (OctreoScan) or Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT scans are particularly useful for detecting somatostatin receptor-positive NETs. Treatment varies by the type of NET, its location, and stage at diagnosis and may include surgery, targeted therapies, somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), among others. Understanding the diverse nature of NETs is crucial for appropriate diagnosis and management, given their variable presentations, behaviors, and prognosis."},{"instruction":"Can Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT scans pick up lesions missed by pet ct with fdg when it comes to detecting sclc at very early stage?","output":"Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT and FDG PET/CT are imaging techniques that utilize different tracers to visualize tumors. Each tracer has its own unique properties and affinities, making them suitable for detecting different types of cancers and their metabolic activity. # FDG PET/CT FDG PET/CT uses 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a glucose analog, to detect areas of increased glucose metabolism, which is a hallmark of many types of cancer, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Since cancer cells often have higher metabolic rates than normal cells, FDG PET/CT can be effective in identifying active tumors. However, its effectiveness can vary depending on the cancer type and its metabolic activity. # Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT, on the other hand, targets somatostatin receptors, which are often expressed on the surface of neuroendocrine tumor cells. This makes Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT particularly useful for imaging neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). It binds to somatostatin receptors, allowing for visualization of tumors that express these receptors. # Comparison and Effectiveness for SCLC SCLC is a type of neuroendocrine tumor, but it has a high grade and is typically very aggressive with a high metabolic rate, making FDG PET/CT generally effective for detecting SCLC due to its ability to highlight areas of high glucose metabolism. Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT scans are more specific for well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, which usually express somatostatin receptors more abundantly. While SCLC may express somatostatin receptors, their expression level and the aggressiveness of SCLC might reduce the effectiveness of Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT for this specific cancer compared to FDG PET/CT. # Early-Stage Detection For detecting SCLC at a very early stage, FDG PET/CT is typically considered the more suitable option due to the high metabolic activity of SCLC. Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT might miss certain lesions that do not express somatostatin receptors at a high level or are too aggressive, which is often the case with SCLC. It's important to note that the choice between these imaging modalities depends on the clinical context, the specific type of cancer suspected, and the purpose of the imaging (e.g., initial diagnosis, staging, response assessment, or surveillance). In some cases, both types of PET/CT scans might be used together or in sequence to provide comprehensive information about the disease. In summary, while Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT is invaluable for detecting well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, FDG PET/CT is generally more effective for detecting high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas like SCLC, especially in early stages due to the high metabolic activity of these tumors."},{"instruction":"What's,well differentiated tumors","output":"\\"Well-differentiated\\" describes tumors that closely resemble normal cells from the tissue they originate. This term is used in histopathology and oncology to classify tumors based on their appearance under a microscope in comparison to normal, non-cancerous cells of the same tissue type. The degree of differentiation is a key factor in determining the grade of a tumor, which is an important aspect of cancer diagnosis and helps guide treatment choices. # Characteristics of Well-Differentiated Tumors 1. **Cell Appearance:** The cells of well-differentiated tumors retain many of the morphological (structural) and functional characteristics of normal cells in the tissue from which they arise. This means they look and might act much like the healthy cells of the tissue type. 2. **Growth Rate:** Well-differentiated tumors tend to grow and spread at a slower rate compared to poorly differentiated or undifferentiated tumors, which have cells that look nothing like normal cells, grow rapidly, and are often more aggressive. 3. **Prognosis:** Generally, well-differentiated tumors have a better prognosis than their poorly differentiated counterparts, mainly because their growth is slower and they are less likely to invade surrounding tissues or metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) early in their development. # Grading System Tumors are graded based on their degree of differentiation: - **Grade 1 (Low Grade or Well-Differentiated):** These tumors closely resemble normal tissue and tend to have a better prognosis. - **Grade 2 (Intermediate Grade or Moderately Differentiated):** These tumors have characteristics between well-differentiated and poorly differentiated. - **Grade 3 (High Grade or Poorly Differentiated):** These tumors appear abnormal and do not clearly resemble the original tissue. - **Grade 4 (High Grade or Undifferentiated):** These tumors have cells that do not resemble any normal cells in appearance or function and usually represent the most aggressive cancers. # Well-Differentiated Tumors in the Context of Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs) In the context of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), well-differentiated tumors often maintain some functional aspects similar to the neuroendocrine cells they originate from, potentially producing hormones. These tumors are contrasted with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, which are more aggressive and have a worse prognosis. Since neuroendocrine cells are found throughout the body, well-differentiated NETs can arise in various locations, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and lungs, among others. The treatment and management of NETs heavily depend on the degree of differentiation, with well-differentiated NETs often managed differently than their poorly differentiated counterparts."},{"instruction":"Why is raise of nse and progrp so specific to sclc?","output":"The specific elevation of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is closely related to the cellular origin and biological characteristics of this type of cancer. Understanding why these markers are particularly elevated in SCLC involves a look at both the nature of SCLC and the function of these markers. # Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) 1. **Neuroendocrine Nature:** SCLC originates from neuroendocrine cells within the lung. These cells are part of the body’s neuroendocrine system, which consists of cells that both release hormones in response to signals from the nervous system and have features resembling nerve cells. 2. **Aggressiveness:** SCLC is known for its rapid growth and early metastasis. It accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases and is strongly associated with cigarette smoking. SCLC is characterized by small, densely packed tumor cells. # Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) 1. **Neuroendocrine Marker:** NSE is an enzyme found in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, which are the cell types from which SCLC originates. In the context of cancer, NSE is released into the bloodstream from the neuroendocrine tumor cells. 2. **Expression in SCLC:** Given its neuroendocrine origin, SCLC tends to express NSE at higher levels, making NSE a useful tumor marker for both diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression or response to treatment in patients with this type of cancer. # Pro-Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (ProGRP) 1. **Specific to Neuroendocrine Cells:** ProGRP is a precursor to gastrin-releasing peptide, which plays a role in numerous physiological processes, including the stimulation of gastrin release. It is particularly expressed in neuroendocrine tissues, and its elevated levels are significantly associated with SCLC due to the tumor's neuroendocrine characteristics. 2. **High Sensitivity and Specificity for SCLC:** ProGRP has been found to have a high sensitivity and specificity for SCLC. This makes it an exceptional biomarker for distinguishing SCLC from other types of lung cancer and other neuroendocrine tumors, which might not elevate ProGRP levels to the same extent. # Conclusion The elevation of both NSE and ProGRP in SCLC is attributed to the tumor’s neuroendocrine origin and the biological characteristics of these markers, reflecting their role in the neuroendocrine system. Their increased levels in patients with SCLC make these markers particularly useful for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of this highly aggressive cancer. The specificity and sensitivity of NSE and ProGRP to SCLC highlight the importance of these biomarkers in the clinical management of the disease."},{"instruction":"Please list all types of lung cancer that fall under neuroendocrine tumors","output":"Lung cancers categorized under neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) represent a spectrum ranging from relatively indolent (slow-growing) to highly aggressive malignancies. These cancers originate from neuroendocrine cells present in the lung. Understanding this spectrum is crucial because the treatment approach and prognosis can vary significantly depending on the specific type of neuroendocrine tumor. Here are the main types of lung cancer that fall under the category of neuroendocrine tumors: # 1. Typical Carcinoid Tumors - **Characteristics:** These are the least aggressive form of lung NETs and tend to grow slowly. They rarely spread to other parts of the body. - **Symptoms:** Often asymptomatic in early stages, can cause symptoms related to hormone secretion or obstruction. - **Treatment:** Surgery is typically the primary treatment option. # 2. Atypical Carcinoid Tumors - **Characteristics:** More aggressive than typical carcinoid tumors, atypical carcinoid tumors have a higher likelihood of metastasis but are less aggressive than small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). - **Symptoms:** Similar to typical carcinoids but may present with more advanced disease due to their greater aggressiveness. - **Treatment:** Surgical resection is preferred, with considerations for adjuvant chemotherapy in some cases. # 3. Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) - **Characteristics:** Highly aggressive and rapidly growing, SCLC accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers. It typically presents with extensive disease due to its propensity for early metastasis. - **Symptoms:** Patients may present with symptoms related to rapid tumor growth and metastasis, such as cough, weight loss, and shortness of breath, among others. - **Treatment:** Due to its aggressive nature, treatment usually involves combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is rarely an option due to the advanced stage at diagnosis. # 4. Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC) - **Characteristics:** This is a rare and aggressive form of lung cancer that shares histopathological features with both non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and SCLC. LCNEC is characterized by large cells with neuroendocrine differentiation. - **Symptoms:** Similar to other aggressive forms of lung cancer, including cough, chest pain, and systemic symptoms. - **Treatment:** Management strategies can include surgery for early-stage disease, combined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for more advanced stages. # Diagnosis and Management The diagnosis of lung NETs typically involves a combination of imaging studies (such as CT scans), biopsy for histological examination, and possibly the measurement of specific markers in the blood. The treatment and prognosis vary significantly across the spectrum of lung NETs, with typical carcinoid tumors usually having the best prognosis and SCLC being the most aggressive with a poorer prognosis. Multidisciplinary treatment approaches are often necessary, involving thoracic surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists, among others. Understanding the diversity within lung neuroendocrine tumors is essential for appropriate clinical management, as each subtype follows a different clinical course and requires tailored treatment strategies."},{"instruction":"Do all of them typically lead to elevation of nse and progrp?","output":"Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) can be elevated in cases of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), especially in lung cancers. However, their levels and the frequency of elevation vary significantly among the different types of lung NETs. # 1. Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) - **NSE and ProGRP:** Both of these markers are often significantly elevated in SCLC. ProGRP, in particular, is recognized for its high sensitivity and specificity for SCLC. The elevation of these markers reflects the aggressive, high-grade neuroendocrine nature of SCLC, making them useful for diagnosis, monitoring treatment response, and detecting recurrence. # 2. Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC) - **NSE:** NSE can be elevated in LCNEC, given its neuroendocrine component, although this is less specific and less frequently seen compared to SCLC. - **ProGRP:** There may also be an elevation in ProGRP levels in LCNEC, but like NSE, this is not as common or as pronounced as in SCLC. The use of ProGRP as a biomarker for LCNEC is not as established or routinely utilized in clinical practice. # 3. Typical Carcinoid and Atypical Carcinoid Tumors - **NSE:** Elevation of NSE can occur but is less common in carcinoid tumors compared to SCLC. NSE levels in carcinoid tumors, if elevated, tend to be lower and may not be as diagnostically useful. - **ProGRP:** ProGRP is generally not elevated in typical and atypical carcinoid tumors. These tumors are less aggressive and have a lower grade compared to SCLC and LCNEC, and ProGRP is not considered a marker for these types of lung NETs. In summary, while elevation of NSE and ProGRP is particularly characteristic of and useful for diagnosing and monitoring SCLC, these markers are less commonly elevated and less diagnostically useful in LCNEC, typical carcinoid, and atypical carcinoid tumors. The utility of these markers largely reflects the biological behavior and aggressiveness of the tumor, with high-grade, aggressive neuroendocrine carcinomas like SCLC showing more significant elevations."},{"instruction":"If sclc is ruled out, what the next most possible diagnosis. Please include all other types of cancer.","output":"If small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is ruled out but a patient still presents with symptoms or findings that suggest cancer, there are several other types of malignancies that could be considered, depending on the clinical presentation, imaging results, and specific biomarker levels. Lung cancer itself can be broadly categorized into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with NSCLC accounting for the majority of cases. However, when considering the broader spectrum of possible diagnoses beyond just lung cancer, it's important to take into account a wide range of cancers that can present with similar symptoms or radiologic findings. Below is a summarization of possible diagnoses: # Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 1. **Types:** a. **Adenocarcinoma** - The most common type of NSCLC and lung cancer overall, often occurring in peripheral lung tissue. b. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Generally originates in the central part of the lungs near the main bronchi. c. **Large Cell Carcinoma** - A less common form that can appear in any part of the lung and tends to grow and spread quickly. 2. **Key Points:** - NSCLC generally has a slower progression than SCLC. - Treatment and prognosis differ, with surgical resection being a more common option in early-stage disease. # Other Lung Tumors 1. **Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC)** - High-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, similar in aggressiveness to SCLC but classified under NSCLC due to its large cell characteristics. 2. **Carcinoid Tumors** - Include typical and atypical variants, representing well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. # Metastatic Tumors to the Lung - Cancers from other parts of the body (e.g., breast, colon, kidney, melanoma) can metastasize to the lungs and mimic primary lung cancer in imaging studies. # Other Types of Cancers That Can Present Similarly 1. **Pleural Mesothelioma** - A rare cancer associated with asbestos exposure, affecting the lining of the lungs (pleura). 2. **Esophageal Cancer** - Especially in advanced stages, can present with respiratory symptoms due to local invasion or metastasis. 3. **Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma** - Tumors of the thymus that can present with symptoms due to compression of nearby structures or paraneoplastic syndromes. 4. **Mediastinal Masses** - Not all mediastinal masses are malignant, but they can include lymphomas (Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin), germ cell tumors, and neurogenic tumors, all of which could theoretically present with symptoms similar to those seen in lung cancer. It's important to conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including detailed imaging studies, histopathological analysis, and molecular testing where appropriate, to accurately diagnose the specific type of cancer or rule out malignancy. The exact diagnostic approach will depend on the patient's clinical presentation, history, and initial test results."},{"instruction":"What cancers can metastasize to the lungs and lead to elevation of nse and progrp, yet patient remains asymptomatic, and pet ct with fdg shows negative.","output":"A scenario where a patient has metastatic cancer to the lungs with elevations of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), remains asymptomatic, and yet has a negative FDG PET/CT scan, is quite complex and relatively rare. Both NSE and ProGRP are markers associated primarily with neuroendocrine characteristics, with ProGRP, in particular, being highly specific to small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, several other cancers might metastasize to the lung and potentially increase these markers under specific circumstances, even if they don't always result in a positive FDG PET/CT. # Cancers That May Metastasize to the Lungs and Potentially Elevate NSE and/or ProGRP: 1. **Other Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs)** - Some neuroendocrine tumors outside of SCLC, particularly those from the gastrointestinal tract (like pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors) or from the bronchial system (carcinoid tumors), might elevate these markers. NETs can occasionally present with \\"cold\\" spots on FDG PET/CT due to their variable metabolic activity. 2. **Breast Cancer** - Certain subtypes, particularly small cell/neuroendocrine variants of breast cancer, could potentially raise these markers. While breast cancer commonly metastasizes to the lung, the specific elevation of NSE and ProGRP would be unusual. 3. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - This rare skin cancer with neuroendocrine features could potentially lead to elevated levels of NSE and ProGRP. Merkel cell carcinoma is known for aggressive behavior and metastasis, including to the lungs. 4. **Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma** - These neuroendocrine tumors arising from adrenal glands (pheochromocytoma) or extra-adrenal locations (paraganglioma) can metastasize and might elevate NSE. They typically have intense FDG uptake, but atypical presentations can occur. 5. **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma** - A type of thyroid cancer with neuroendocrine features. It generally produces calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) but in atypical cases might lead to elevation of other neuroendocrine markers. # Factors to Consider - **Asymptomatic Patients:** The absence of symptoms in a patient with metastatic disease to the lungs and elevated tumor markers is curious and suggests that the metastatic burden might be low or that the tumors are biologically less aggressive. - **Negative FDG PET/CT:** Some neuroendocrine tumors, especially well-differentiated ones, might show low metabolic activity on FDG PET/CT scans. This is because such tumors can have low glucose uptake, making them appear \\"cold\\" on FDG PET despite metastatic disease. It's essential to consider the entire clinical context—including the patient's history, pathology, and the results of other imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, or somatostatin receptor imaging (like Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT for neuroendocrine tumors)—for a comprehensive diagnostic approach. Additionally, a biopsy of accessible lesions, when possible, would provide definitive histological and molecular characterization of the metastatic disease, particularly in cases where standard imaging and serum markers generate atypical results or conflicting information."},{"instruction":"From the information you can gather, statistically, is it more likely that the cancer is originated from lungs instead of metastasis from other parts of the body?","output":"Given the provided context of elevated neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) levels, and focusing on the statistical probabilities based on available cancer data and the specificity of these markers, it is generally more likely that the cancer originated from the lungs, particularly if we are considering small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or other neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. # Reasons Supporting Lung Origin: 1. **Marker Specificity:** ProGRP is highly specific to neuroendocrine lung cancers, especially SCLC. While NSE can be elevated in a variety of neuroendocrine tumors and other conditions, the combination of elevated NSE and ProGRP significantly increases the likelihood of a lung origin, particularly SCLC, given ProGRP's strong association with this disease. 2. **Statistical Prevalence:** Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers globally and is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. SCLC, while less common than non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is known for its aggressiveness and propensity for early metastasis, often presenting with extensive disease. 3. **Clinical Presentation:** SCLC and other neuroendocrine lung tumors can be asymptomatic in early stages, especially in limited disease, but they commonly present with symptoms due to their aggressive nature. However, a scenario wherein a patient remains asymptomatic, with elevated markers and negative FDG PET/CT, creates a complex diagnostic challenge that might still lean toward a lung primary simply due to the specificity of ProGRP and the high prevalence and aggressive behavior of SCLC. # Considering Metastatic Disease: While the combination of elevated NSE and ProGRP with a lung lesion highly suggests a lung primary, cancers from other parts of the body can metastasize to the lungs. However, these would not typically result in elevated levels of ProGRP, and while NSE might be elevated in various neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumors, its specificity for lung neuroendocrine tumors in this context is noteworthy. # Diagnostic Approach: In clinical practice, the diagnostic approach to an undiagnosed lung mass or abnormality would consider the patient's clinical history, risk factors (e.g., smoking status), symptoms, and a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation including, but not limited to, imaging studies, histopathological analysis (biopsy), and molecular profiling where appropriate. This holistic approach helps in differentiating between primary lung cancers, metastatic disease from other sites, and benign conditions, ensuring accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Given this context, while exceptions can occur, the statistical likelihood and clinical reasoning often point toward a primary lung origin, especially SCLC, when both NSE and ProGRP are elevated, and there's a lung lesion in question, unless proven otherwise by further diagnostics."},{"instruction":"There's no lesion according to pet ct with fdg. Please review your answer.","output":"Apologies for the oversight. If there is no lesion detected on an FDG PET/CT scan, but there is an elevation of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), the situation thus involves reconsidering the initial interpretation. In the absence of detectable lesions on FDG PET/CT, several scenarios could still lead us to consider a primary lung cancer, notably forms that may not be metabolically active or sizable enough to be detected via this imaging modality. However, the specific elevation of NSE and ProGRP strongly indicates a neuroendocrine origin, with SCLC being a primary candidate given these markers. Yet, if the PET/CT shows no lesion, we must also consider: # 1. Early Detection or Very Small Lesion: A very early-stage disease or a very small lesion might not be picked up by FDG PET/CT, especially if the lesion has low metabolic activity or is below the resolution limit of the imaging. # 2. Types of Cancer with Low FDG Uptake: Certain cancers, including some neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), might not show significant uptake of FDG, making them less visible on FDG PET/CT scans. This includes some forms of lung NETs, though it's less common for SCLC and more typical for well-differentiated NETs like carcinoids, which would less likely lead to elevated ProGRP. # 3. Extrathoracic Malignancy: An occult or hidden primary tumor outside the lung, which could be of neuroendocrine origin, might cause an elevation in these markers. These could include neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas (though typically more associated with other markers). However, given the strong lung association of ProGRP especially, this might be less likely without other clinical indications pointing away from the lung. # Evaluation and Next Steps: Given the complexity of such a presentation, further diagnostic steps could include: - **Enhanced Imaging Techniques**: Additional imaging with higher sensitivity for NETs, such as Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT, which targets somatostatin receptors common in NETs. - **Pulmonary Function Tests** and **Bronchoscopy**: If a lung origin is strongly suspected despite negative imaging. - **Repeat Imaging**: Over time, to monitor for the development of any lesions. - **Biochemical Testing**: Comprehensive biochemical profiling to look for additional markers or hormonal syndromes associated with neuroendocrine activity. - **Consultation with a Multidisciplinary Team**: Including pulmonologists, oncologists, and radiologists to consider less common diagnoses and ensure a thorough diagnostic approach. # Conclusion: In this corrected scenario, without a detectable lesion on FDG PET/CT but with elevated NSE and ProGRP, the clinical picture remains challenging. The high specificity of ProGRP for neuroendocrine activity, particularly of lung origin, leads to a continued suspicion of a neuroendocrine process, possibly SCLC, despite the unusual presentation. A comprehensive diagnostic approach, as outlined above, becomes essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. This scenario underscores the complexity of diagnosing certain cancers and the need for a nuanced, multidisciplinary approach to care."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

<p>“这种情况可能会引发投资者对公司自主盈利能力的担忧。长期依赖政府补助可能会减弱公司的市场竞争力和自我调整能力，因此，公司需要在未来寻求更加可持续的盈利模式，并提高其核心业务的竞争力。”天使投资人、知名互联网专家郭涛对《华夏时报》记者表示。</p> <p>就相关问题，本报记者致函公司董秘办，但截至发稿未收到回复。</p> <p><strong>政府补助或为公司盈利主因</strong></p> <p>公开资料显示，<span web=\\"1\\" href=\\"http://quote.eastmoney.com/unify/r/0.002410\\" class=\\"em_stock_key_common\\" data-code=\\"0,002410\\"><a

id=\\"bk_90.BK0740\\"><a href=\\"https://wap.eastmoney.com/quote/stock/90.BK0740.html\\">教育</a></span><span id=\\"bkquote_90.BK0740\\"></span>、数字金融等数个创新业务单元；根据业务区域不同，又分为国内业务和海外业务。</p> <p>在公司近期举行的业绩说明会上，公司相关负责人介绍道，公司一季度数字新成本新签合同有所下滑，施工业务有所下滑，一直以来施工交付实施成本居高不下。</p> <p>“虽然数字新成本一季度新签合同上是有所下滑，但从业务端来看，新成本的续费率有所提升。而在施工业务上，从客观外部需求端来看，受季节性影响，从主观的角度看，公司对产品结构做了调整，重点聚焦在四小龙产品，自下而上推广使用，和开工数的直接联系比往年更紧密一些。”公司相关负责人表示。</p> <p>他续称，后续的经营战略上，公司坚定认为施工业务是公司的第二曲线。不过，据此前年报显示，2023年公司数字施工业务营收同比下滑35.00%，毛利率同比下滑22.56%，主要是2023年施工企业的经营压力普遍较大。</p> <p>除公司营收有所下滑外，净利润也现下降。利润表中，管理费用、投资收益、信用减值损失变动明显。</p> <p>其中，公司管理费用增加了约1.35亿元，同比增加了47.62%。“公司在24 年初对部分业务进行了调整，对相应的岗位人员进行了优化。人员优化所带来的相关费用一次性计入当期的管理费用，导致一季度管理费用大幅增加，进而导致一季度归母净利润同比出现明显下降。”公司副总裁、董事会秘书冯健雄在业绩说明会上表示。</p> <p>“人员优化后，一方面更聚焦在核心的产品、核心的区域上；另一方面是在流程上提效，包括整个供应链的优化、交付过程中的项目计划性管理和资源有效性管理、与财务相关的能力匹配等等。从目前来看，人员优化的效果已经产生，三费剔除一次性补偿后同比明显下降，而且这个下降会一直持续到全年。”公司相关负责人表示。</p> <p>“这通常被视为公司短期内的成本压力。这种成本的增加可能会在短期内对公司的利润率产生负面影响。然而，如果这些变化是公司战略重组的一部分，并且能够带来长期的效率提升和成本节约，那么它们可能会在未来对公司的营收和利润产生积极影响。关键在于管理层是否能够有效地执行这些变革，并确保这些成本在可预见的未来得到回报。”郭涛认为。</p> <p>同时，利润表中变动幅度较大的信用减值损失在报告期内同比增加196.29%。“主要为报告期应收账款余额增加额同比增长，相应计提的减值准备增加所致。”公司在报告中写道。据一季度报告显示，截至一季度，公司应收账款为9.54亿元。</p> <p>值得注意的是，公司一季度扣非净利润现亏损。据非经常性损益表，公司计入当期损益的政府补助为615.12万元，主要为政府课题研发经费、政府奖励等收益。而公司本期净利润为607.81万元，公司收到的政府补助占净利润比重为101.20%，也就是说公司实现净利润为正或主要是因政府补助所致。</p> <p>对此，盘古智库高级研究员江瀚对《华夏时报》记者表示，这反映出公司目前的核心业务盈利能力可能存在问题。政府补助虽然暂时缓解了净利润的下滑压力，但并非长久之计。</p> <p><strong>公司热衷投资理财</strong></p> <p>据此前公告显示，公司自2013年起热衷投资理财。2022年—2024年，公司分别使用最高额度为6亿元、10亿元及10亿元人民币的自有闲置资金进行委托理财。</p> <p>据公告，公司购买的理财产品为安全性高、流动性好、风险可控的产品，包括但不限于商业<span id=\\"bk_90.BK0475\\"><a href=\\"https://wap.eastmoney.com/quote/stock/90.BK0475.html\\">银行</a></span><span id=\\"bkquote_90.BK0475\\"></span>理财产品、国债逆回购、金融机构其他理财产品（不包括风险投资）等较低风险理财产品。</p> <p>而公司一季度利润表中变动较大的投资收益变动与此有关。一季度公司投资收益减少了197.34%，主要为联营企业亏损增加按权益法确认的投资损失增加、理财及分红收益减少所致。</p> <p>同时，在资产负债表中也有所体现，一季度公司货币资金同比减少36.18%，主要为报告期成本费用投入、购买理财产品、金融子业务发放贷款、股票回购所致；其他流动资产增加了328.06%，为购买理财产品所致。</p> <p>公司投资理财结果如何？一季度公司委托他人投资或管理资产的损益为83.77万元。</p> <p>值得一提的是，公司还曾因投资理财收过监管函。据悉，此前公司董事会同意公司及全资子公司<span web=\\"1\\" href=\\"http://quote.eastmoney.com/unify/r/0.002410\\" class=\\"em_stock_key_common\\" data-code=\\"0,002410\\">广联达</span>西安科技有限公司使用不超过人民币0.6亿元（含）额度的闲置募集资金进行现金管理，期限为自董事会审议通过之日起12个月。但后续，你公司在使用暂时闲置募集资金进行现金管理时，存在实际使用金额超出前期审议额度的情形，最高超额使用金额为0.47亿元。</p> <p>对此，深交所指出公司该行为违反了深交所相关规定，深交所提醒公司及全体董事、监事、高级管理人员严格遵守《<span id=\\"bk_90.BK0473\\"><a href=\\"https://wap.eastmoney.com/quote/stock/90.BK0473.html\\">证券</a></span><span id=\\"bkquote_90.BK0473\\"></span>法》《公司法》等法律法规，以及深交所《股票上市规则》及相关规定，杜绝此类事件的发生。</p> <p>“上市公司热衷投资理财的现象在目前的资本市场上比较普遍，这是由于许多上市公司面临较大的资金压力和财务风险，同时资本市场环境的变化也使得投资理财成为一种重要的财务管理方式。”经济学家、新金融专家余丰慧在接受《华夏时报》记者采访时表示。</p> <p>郭涛则认为，虽然适度的投资可以帮助公司分散风险并提高资本效率，但过度依赖投资理财可能会导致公司偏离其核心业务，增加财务风险，并可能掩盖运营中的问题。因此，公司应该谨慎地平衡其投资活动，并确保这些活动与其长期战略和股东利益一致。</p><center style=\\"text-align:left;\\"><div class=\\"em_adv_mods\\" type=\\"1\\"

Грибы великолепно сочетаются с ароматом копчения, получаемым при готовке на открытом огне. Вот базовый рецепт приготовления грибов на мангале: # Ингредиенты: - Грибы (шампиньоны, шиитаке, портобелло или любые другие крупные грибы), 500 г - Оливковое масло, 3-4 столовые ложки - Соль, по вкусу - Черный молотый перец, по вкусу - Любимые травы и специи (например, чеснок порошок, тимьян, розмарин), по вкусу # Инструкция: 1. **Подготовка грибов:** Промойте грибы под прохладной водой и аккуратно промокните их бумажным полотенцем. Если используете крупные грибы, например, портобелло, их можно нарезать на более мелкие части или половинки. 2. **Маринование:** В большой миске смешайте оливковое масло с солью, перцем и выбранными травами и специями. Добавьте подготовленные грибы и осторожно перемешайте, чтобы грибы хорошо покрылись маринадом. Дайте им постоять примерно 15-30 минут. 3. **Разогрев мангала:** Пока грибы маринуются, подготовьте мангал до умеренного уровня жара. Грибы лучше готовить на умеренном жаре, чтобы они прогрелись изнутри, не подгорая снаружи. 4. **Готовка:** Грибы можно готовить на шампурах или специальной решетке для гриллинга. Если используете шампуры, насадите грибы на них. Если грибы маленькие, их удобно готовить в решетке, чтобы они не выпадали. Кладите грибы на мангал и жарьте, регулярно переворачивая, до готовности, примерно 10-15 минут, в зависимости от размера грибов. 5. **Подача:** Готовые грибы можно подавать как отдельное блюдо или как гарнир к мясным блюдам. Они также хороши в виде начинок для бургеров или в салатах. # Советы: - Для дополнительного вкуса можно добавить в маринад немного соевого соуса или бальзамического уксуса. - Если есть опасения, что грибы подгорят, их можно обернуть в фольгу, так они получатся более сочными и нежными. - Обязательно оставьте ненадолго приготовленные грибы отдохнуть после готовки, так они станут еще вкуснее. Приготовление грибов на мангале — это прекрасный способ разнообразить летнее меню и добавить в него аромат дымка и лесных нот."},{"instruction":"Format the following passage properly, for storytelling purposes. Cracking my knuckles to release whatever gases have built up inside them, I settle into another chapter. Aside from the faint hum of the ceiling fan, its blades steadily spinning with trance-inducing timing in a nearly hypnotic yet almost unnoticeable rhythm, and the faintest traces of dialogue from a program on the living room television set, the atmosphere seems peaceful, idyllic even. A pronounced brightness visible through the window has died down to a more subdued level, one that suggests the possibility of overcast, and potential rain in the near future. It would not surprise me if it did rain today, and I hope it does, knowing the rain will not only sustain the current flora but allow new flora to grow. And so the cycle of life goes on. The trees outside gently sway, leaves dancing on branches in stops and starts, their pace moderated by the flow of the wind. I see how nature's timing is different from that of mankind. The leaves will not always move at the same level of intensity, but the fan is capable of consistently spinning at a given speed, so long as it is maintained properly and the electricity is functional for that purpose. And yet, while I appreciate the convenience of a fan that keeps me from sweating too profusely in a home where the temperature is kept at seventy-five degrees, I admire the unpredictability of His divine design, for its major advantage over our man-made machinery: its capability to function without an outlet, without wires or instruction books. I have become an adopter of modern technologies, making an effort to embrace all that makes them beneficial to human society. Perhaps as a byproduct of having been born into the millennial generation, I came of age at a time when technology was taking more and more of a hold on our collective consciousness. I crack my knuckles again, noticing how more gases have accumulated. Though I was too young to understand at the time I have an even greater appreciation now than ever before for the generations that preceded my own, the visionaries whose determination realized the conveniences we take for granted. In my home, I know a few people who are around my age, but am also surrounded by older people who lived in a world without the things we have now. They had to do everything the hard way; even what was convenient then would be considered by some as inconveniences nowadays. I remember reading an interview with a veteran game music composer who worked at both SNK and Capcom during the 1980s and was still making music into the 1990s; she is semi-retired now, but still works on projects from time to time. Reflecting on her early years, speaking on her composition techniques at a time when the hardware was not as powerful as it is today, she spoke of having to enter music in a custom MML language using hexadecimal numbers for notation. She became intimately familiar with command prompts, and did not have the benefit of a luxurious graphical user interface. Everything was bare bones to the core. She was asked whether she found it difficult, and she said she didn't because back then, that was all that the composers had. There was no alternate, or additional, frame of reference to compare the process against. By the early 90s, she was freelance and had essentially become a 'gun for hire'. Having come into the industry at a time when the music was still reliant on PSGs (programmable sound generators) and FM synthesis ICs, and EPROMs remained expensive, she lasted long enough to be able to capitalize on advancements in technology. Her soundtracks for two particular titles (\\"Pulstar\\" and \\"Blazing Star\\") use a feature of the YM2610 IC featured on the Neo-Geo hardware that powered these games: a special ADPCM (adaptive differential pulse-code modulation) sound source that could play back sampled audio at different rates with a maximum sample size of 16MB. Ironically, the YM2610 does include four FM channels and a built-in YM2149 (adding three PSG channels), but it turned out she would not need to use those features at all. A young developer had observed how high-capacity EPROMs were less expensive than ever before; with the extra ROM space it was now possible to 'stream' an entire soundtrack with ADPCM rather than programming FM and PSG sound sources. She took full advantage, using her own equipment to get the music to sound just as she intended it, then sampled it at 22.05 kHz, achieving nearly CD-quality audio without using too much ROM space in the process. The YM2610 also has six more ADPCM channels, with a fixed rate of 18.5 kHz, which she allocated for realistic, immersive sound effects. The FM and PSG ultimately went unused; the focus was clearly on 'real' sounds, and both of these games have that in spades. In many ways, the developers are just as important as the legacies they have left behind for us to enjoy, and the stories behind how these games were created sometimes manage to be more intriguing than the games themselves. Even the players who bring these games to life by mastering them to completion manage to be quite fascinating too. One such player is broadcasting a game showcase, and has recently gotten into the habit of showing skill in several different games over the course of one stream. Currently on display is \\"Seibu Cup Soccer\\", an arcade sports game from the early 1990s in which he has become highly proficient. Now in the third of eight rounds en route to becoming champion, he is fresh off leading Korea (his native team) to a 10-1 beat-down of Italy, and has just scored his seventh goal against England. I close out of the stream to focus on the melodies of a bird that can be heard just outside the window. I could not tell you what they are singing about, and the song has ended nearly as quickly as it started, but those are the moments I tend to cherish the most. For all the negativity that dominates the world, there is still beauty to be found amidst the ugliness. There is so much to rejoice about. I have a roof. I am able to eat healthy food and keep myself hydrated. I am surrounded by enthralling people with engrossing experiences, not only in this home but everywhere else I go. I am able to work for wages. I have a bed to sleep in, clothes to wear, and more than a few of life's luxuries. It's not all bad, nor is it all good, but I can say for sure the good outweighs the bad. In the kitchen, there is an abstract painting with circles of various sizes. Some are more horizontal, others more vertical. Some are more isolated, others overlap. My life is just as colorful. Everyone in this house has become one of those circles.","output":"Cracking my knuckles to release whatever gases have built up inside them, I settle into another chapter.

The years 1911-1912, in particular, witnessed the culmination of widespread discontent against the Qing Dynasty, culminating in a revolutionary fervor that sought not merely the overthrow of the Manchu rulers but the restoration of the Ming Dynasty, envisioning a return to an era perceived as China's golden age of enlightenment and prosperity. Prelude to Restoration Discontent had been brewing for decades, with the Qing Dynasty increasingly seen as corrupt, incompetent, and, most significantly, as foreign oppressors by a significant segment of the Han Chinese population. Intellectuals and reformists, inspired by the rich heritage of the Ming and the principles it represented, began to envision a China free from Manchu rule, one that could reclaim its former glory on the world stage. The Spark of Revolution The Wuchang Uprising, initially a response to an incident involving the nationalization of railways, quickly escalated into a full-blown revolution. Key provinces declared their allegiance to the revolutionary cause, not merely in opposition to the Qing but with the express goal of \\"Overthrowing Qing and restoring Ming.\\" This rallying cry united various revolutionary factions with a common, tangible objective, setting this revolution apart from previous uprisings. The Ming Restoration Movement Central to the success of the revolution was the Ming Restoration Movement, a coalition of intellectuals, former officials, and military leaders who shared a profound reverence for the Ming Dynasty's legacy. This movement effectively galvanized support across China, leveraging historical symbolism and the promise of a return to Confucian ideals to muster a formidable force against the Qing. The Final Confrontation and Qing Abdication By late 1911, the Qing forces found themselves increasingly isolated, with key generals defecting and several southern provinces in open rebellion. The turning point came with the Siege of Beijing in early 1912, a meticulously planned operation led by revolutionary forces, which saw the ancient capital encircled and the Qing leadership effectively cut off. Realizing the futility of resistance and seeking to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, the last Qing Emperor, Puyi, abdicated in February 1912. In a historic declaration, he transferred sovereignty to the Provisional Ming Government, marking the end of over two hundred and sixty years of Manchu rule and the beginning of Ming Restoration. The Ming Dynasty in the 20th Century The re-established Ming Dynasty faced numerous challenges, from consolidating control and modernizing the nation to navigating the complexities of international diplomacy in an era dominated by colonial powers. Under the leadership of the first Ming emperor of the new era, significant reforms were enacted, focusing on education, military modernization, and economic development, drawing both from China's rich traditions and contemporary global practices. Notably, the Ming Restoration did not seek isolation but rather active engagement with the global community, establishing diplomatic relations and participating in international events. China's rejuvenation during this period is widely regarded as the \\"Ming Miracle,\\" embodying a nation's capability to restore its historic greatness while adapting to the changing dynamics of the modern world. Legacy and Conclusion The success of the Xinhai Revolution in restoring the Ming Dynasty is remembered not merely as a political revolution but as a profound transformation in the identity and trajectory of the Chinese nation. It stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of the Chinese people and their deep-rooted connection to their imperial past, illustrating the unique path China has traversed in the tapestry of world history. The Ming Restoration, thus, is celebrated as a pivotal moment that reshaped not only China but influenced the course of world events in the 20th century and beyond."},{"instruction":"Format the following passage properly, for storytelling purposes.

This includes addressing issues related to improper loop usage for signal detection, incorrect or inefficient usage of functions inside the class, and ensuring all needed features are properly calculated and available for the backtesting framework to use. Below are the essential changes and cleanup needed to make the script functional: 1. **Initializing MetaTrader 5 (MT5) Connection**: It seems you have the initialization at the start but not inside a function or conditional block to prevent it from attempting to shut down immediately if MT5 isn't initialized. You may want to ensure MT5 operations are correctly handled, especially if running this script outside of an environment where MT5 is not needed or available. 2. **Signal Calculation Logic**: The way signals are calculated row-by-row involves recalculating indicators for the entire DataFrame up to the current row, which is highly inefficient. Also, your strategy setup for backtesting (using the backtesting.py library) is not correctly aligned with how indicators and signals are supposed to be used in that framework. 3. **Engulfing Pattern Determination**: The logic for detecting engulfing patterns iterates over the entire DataFrame for each row, which results in a significant performance issue. Instead, you should vectorize this logic or preprocess the signals before the backtest. 4. **Backtesting Strategy Implementation**: The usage of \`self.I\` inside the \`ChubbStrategy\` class is incorrect as it attempts to use instance methods (which it assumes to be indicator functions) directly without defining them properly within the strategy scope. \`self.I\` is meant to wrap a function (and its arguments) to create an indicator. The signal logic should be placed inside the \`next\` method of the strategy or through indicators initialized inside the \`init\` method using proper backtesting.py API calls. Given these points, and focusing purely on script structure corrections without deep-diving into the specifics of the MT5 API or the backtesting strategy effectiveness, a precise fix would involve a thorough restructuring which cannot be fully covered here. However, below is a simplified example focusing mainly on restructuring to fit the backtesting.py framework requirements for a strategy: \`\`\`python from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy import pandas as pd import talib # Assuming df is your dataframe prepared as earlier. def calculate_signals(df): # Example: Add your MACD based buy/sell logic here or other indicator logic macd, signal, _ = talib.MACD(df['Close'], fastperiod=12, slowperiod=26, signalperiod=9) df['MACD'] = macd - signal # MACD histogram as an example return df df = calculate_signals(df) # Ensure your dataframe is ready with all indicators and signals class ChubbStrategy(Strategy): def init(self): # Initialize your indicators: example with MACD self.macd = self.I(talib.MACD, self.data.Close, fastperiod=12, slowperiod=26, signalperiod=9)[0] def next(self): # Your logic to execute trades based on the conditions if crossover(self.macd, 0): # Example: buying if MACD crosses above zero self.buy() elif crossover(0, self.macd): # Selling if MACD crosses below zero self.sell() # Setup and run the backtest bt = Backtest(df, ChubbStrategy, cash=10000, commission=0.0) stats = bt.run() print(stats) # Output your statistics or plot results bt.plot() \`\`\` This example greatly simplifies your initial approach to focus on structuring a strategy that can be run with the backtesting.py library. Note that the implementation of your MACD, Twin Range Filter, and Engulfing pattern detection need to be adapted if you plan to include them as part of your strategy conditions. Remember, the backtesting library and how you process data with pandas, numpy, or TA-Lib, require careful data preparation and understanding of how these libraries interact. Each indicator or trading signal should be properly vectorized for efficient computation and integrated into your strategy using the framework's APIs."},{"instruction":"buatkan script nya dengan benar dan lengkap, perbaiki yang salah : import numpy as np import pandas as pd from backtesting import Strategy, Backtest import talib import MetaTrader5 as mt5 if not mt5.initialize(): print(\\"initialize() failed, error code =\\", mt5.last_error()) mt5.shutdown() symbol = 'XAUUSDm' timeframe = mt5.TIMEFRAME_M5 rates = mt5.copy_rates_from_pos(symbol, timeframe, 0, 10000) df = pd.DataFrame(rates) df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time'], unit='s') df.set_index('time', inplace=True) df.drop(['spread', 'real_volume'], axis=1, inplace=True) def macd(df): macd_result = talib.MACD(df['close'], fastperiod=12, slowperiod=26, signalperiod=9) macd = macd_result[0] signal = macd_result[1] if macd.iloc[-1] > signal.iloc[-1]: return \\"Buy\\" elif macd.iloc[-1] < signal.iloc[-1]: return \\"Sell\\" def twin_range_filter(df): close = df['close'] def smoothrng(x, t, m): wper = t * 2 -

マルクスが『資本論』第二巻で提示した答えはよく知られているので，ここではただ簡潔にその結論をまとめるにとどめたい。 社会的総生産は二部門でおこなわれる。第I部門では生産手段，第II部門では消費手段が生産される。社会的総生産は次の図式であらわされる。 I) II) C1とC2は不変資本をあらわし，それぞれ第I部門，第II部門で作用する。 V1とV2は可変資本をあらわす。すなわち，第I部門，第II部門の労賃である。 cm1とcm2は，第I部門，第II部門において追加的生産手段のために蓄積される資本をあらわす。 vm1とvm2はさらなる生産手段の稼動のために必要な労働者に対する追加的労賃をあらわす。 総資本の変態は生産された商品すべてが市場で販売されることによっておこる。そのさい市場での販売の一部は同一部門内でおこなわれる。たとえば第I 部門の資本によって生みだされた生産手段の一部は，新たに自己の機械廠を設立したり拡大したりする必要のある同一部門内の他の資本によって買われる。この場合，第I部門の商品形態にある資本は，同一部門の他資本の生産的形態に相応するようになる。これらの資本は相互に生産手段をC1＋cm1で等価交換する。総資本のこの部分は第I部門内での変態をひきおこすが，そのさい資本は相互交換によって商品形態から生産的形態に移行する。これに対応したことはV2とvm2で生じる。ここではつぎのような形で変態がおこる。すなわち，第II部門の資本家は労働者に賃金を支払い，その賃金で労働者は第II部門のさまざまな資本家から消費財を買う。売り上げで資本家は新たな労働力を買う。したがって，V2とvm2は商品形態（消費財）から生産的形態（労働力）に転化する。それゆえ，総資本のこの部分もまた市場での交換過程において，第II部門内で商品形態から生産的形態に転化する。 それゆえ，第I部門ではv1とvm1が残り，第II部門にはC2とcm2が残る。資本部分の商品形態から生産的形態への変態は両部門を包摂する市場でおこなわれる。交換は等式 によって表現することができる。この交換で第I部門と第II部門の残りの分の変態がなされる。第I部門の残りの分は商品形態（生産手段）から生産的形態（交換のなかで再び労働力の購入へふりむけられる消費財）へ変わる。それに対応して第II部門の残りの分は商品形態（消費財）から生産的形態（生産手段）へ転化する。したがって，それらの結果，総資本は蓄積のサイクルを一巡する。個別資本はといえば，その資本の商品形態から，生産のサイクルを再びはじめることができる形態へと転化されることによって，同様に蓄積サイクルを一巡する。しかし，そのさい決定的な成果は，総資本の蓄積がすべての個別資本によって生産される剰余価値の総量と同一とされるということである。 アイデンテイテイしかしながらこうした同一 性は，われわれが総資本レヴェルで生ずる新たな生産的労働の諸規定を顧慮するときにはもはや存在しない。これまで上述してきたわれわれの前提はつぎの点であった。1．両部門で給付される労働は，両部門で剰余価値が生産されるから生産的労働である，2．各個別資本の商品形態はひとつあるいは複数の他の個別資本の生産的形態の諸要素に相応する，換言すれば，おのおのの個別資本によって生みだされた商品は例外なく他の資本の生産的資本の諸要素に転化する。 ここから，生産的労働の概念があらたな規定（つまり，剰余価値生産労働としての生産的労働の規定に追加して）を中心に総資本レヴェルで拡大されなければならないということになる。すなわちそれは生産手段であれ生活手段であれ生産的資本の要素に転化する商品を生産する労働は生産的労働であるということになる。 瞥見すればそうではないというものをあげよう。そうすると，資本の商品形態が他の資本の生産的形態の要素に転化されえないというような資本，たとえば奢侈品，武器，インフラストラクチュア財等々があげられるであろう。このような資財の生産は総資本の変態へいかなる作用を及ぼすのか？ このような商品，すなわち奢侈品，武器などの生産に充てられる労働が賃労働であるならば，つまり労働が資本と関係し，市場のために商品を生産するのであれば，この商品は自らの価値の一部に剰余価値を含んでいなければならない。この労働は第一規定によれば生産的労働である。それゆえ，このような商品の生産は c＋v＋mという一般的表式から構成されうる。われわれの再生産表式には二つの部門に第III部門が付け加えられうる。つまり，生産的資本の要素にならないゆえに「不再生産的」とよぶべき商品がこの部門に属する（あるいはまた，これらを奢侈品とよぶこともできる。厳密な意味でいえば，奢侈品はこうした生産のただ一部をなすにすぎないが，軍需生産，インフラストラクチュア財は社会的意味で奢侈品である。なぜならそれは，生産手段の生産にも生活手段の生産にも奉仕しないからである)。 再生産表式はこういう形になる。 ”翻译为中文","output":"马克思在再生产模式的分析中研究了这些媒介。使用再生产模式展示的是，总资本如何可能积累，另一方面，构成它的各个个别资本如何能够从商品资本变为生产资本，在这个过程中，如何不仅仅是补充原始生产资本，而且还能积累追加的生产资本。检验是基于两个资本的表式进行的，制造生产手段的资本全部归入第一部门，生产消费品的资本全部归入第二部门。这种分析的结果同样适用于两种资本，并且在多数资本的一般情况下也是有效的，即这些资本在两个部门中的其中一个或同时跨越两个部门使资本发生转化（后者的情况适用于既可以作为生产货物又可以作为消费品的商品，例如，大部分农业生产，一部分用作消费品，另一部分作为新的农业周期的生产品，或作为进一步加工的生产品使用）。 马克思在《资本论》第二卷中给出的答案是众所周知的，因此，在这里只是简要总结其结论。 社会总生产由两个部门进行。第一部门生产生产资料，第二部门生产消费资料。社会总生产可表示为以下模式： I) II) C1和C2代表固定资本，分别运作于第一部门和第二部门。 V1和V2代表可变资本，即第一、二部门的工资。 cm1和cm2代表第一、二部门中为了追加生产手段而积累的资本。 vm1和vm2代表为了额外生产手段的运行所需的额外工资。 总资本的转变是通过在市场上销售所有产出的商品完成的。其中部分销售是在同一部门内进行的。例如，第一部门生产的生产手段的一部分会被同一部门内需要建立或扩大自己的机械工厂的其他资本购买。这种情况下，第一部门的商品形态的资本将变为同一部门其他资本的生产形态。这些资本通过C1+cm1进行相互等价交换。总资本的这一部分引发了第一部门内的转变，资本通过相互交换从商品形态转为生产形态。对应的，V2和vm2发生了变化。在这里，第二部门的资本家支付工资给劳动者，劳动者用这些工资从第二部门的不同资本家那里购买消费品。通过销售收入，资本家买入新的劳动力。因此，V2和vm2从商品形态（消费品）转变为生产形态（劳动力）。因此，总资本的这部分也在市场交换过程中，从第二部门内的商品形态转变为生产形态。 因此，第一部门剩余v1和vm1，第二部门剩余C2和cm2。资本部分从商品形态到生产形态的转变在包括两个部门的市场上进行。交换可以用等式表示。通过这种交换，完成了第一部门和第二部门剩余部分的转变。第一部门剩余部分从商品形态（生产手段）转变为生产形态（通过交换再次转为购买劳动力的消费品）。相对应的，第二部门剩余部分从商品形态（消费品）转变为生产形态（生产手段）。因此，结果是，总资本完成了一轮积累周期。至于个别资本，通过其资本的商品形态转变为可以重新开始生产周期的形态，同样完成了一轮积累周期。然而，决定性的成果是，总资本的积累与所有个别资本产生的剩余价值总量相等。 然而，当我们考虑到总资本层面产生的新的生产性劳动的各种规定时，这种同一性不再存在。我们先前提到的前提是：1.两个部门提供的劳动是生产性劳动，因为在这两个部门产生剩余价值；2.每一个个别资本的商品形态相应于一个或多个其他个别资本的生产形态的要素，换句话说，每一个个别资本生产的商品无一例外地转变为其他资本的生产资本的要素。 从这里我们看到，生产性劳动的概念必须围绕新的规定（即，除了作为剩余价值生产的劳动的生产性劳动的规定）在总资本水平上进行扩展。也就是说，生产能转化为生产资本要素的商品，无论是生产手段还是生活手段的生产，其劳动都是生产性劳动。 让我们来看看那些非生产性的例子。这样的资本，例如奢侈品、武器、基础设施商品等，其商品形态不能转化为其他资本的生产形态的要素。这类商品的生产对总资本的转变会产生什么影响？ 如果这些商品的生产所涉及的劳动是雇佣劳动，也就是说，如果劳动与资本相关联，为市场生产商品，那么这些商品必须包含剩余价值的一部分。根据第一规定，这种劳动是生产性劳动。因此，这类商品的生产可以由一般表式c+v+m构成。我们的再生产表式可以加入第三部门，即因为不转化为生产资本的要素而被称为“非再生产性”的商品属于这个部门（或者也可以称为奢侈品。严格意义上说，奢侈品只是这类生产的一部分，而军需生产、基础设施商品在社会意义上是奢侈品，因为它们既不服务于生产手段的生产，也不服务于生活手段的生产）。 再生产表式将呈现如下形式。"},{"instruction":"请将“四角で囲まれた資本部分の変態からめんどうなことは生じない。それらの変態は二部門表式でこれまでみてきた再生産分析と相応して，第I部門，第II部門それぞれの内部の市場においておこなわれるからである。第I部門，第II部門の残りの分は二部門表式とのアナロジーで，第I部門ならびに第II部門を包摂するひとつの市場で変態を完成しうるであろう。では，いかなる仕方で第III部門の資本は生産的資本への資本の変態を果すのか？ここでは 明らかにひとつの変態はありえない。というのは，第III部門の不変資本，可変資本あるいは蓄積された資本が第I部門，第II部門との交換を通じて生産的形態へと転化されるとすれば，第I，第II部門の方が商品形態から生産的形態への変態を果しえないことになってしまうからである。なぜなら，「不再生産的な」，生産的資本に転化しえない財を所有することになるからである。その結果出てくるオルタナティヴは，第I部門，第II部門か第III部門のどちらかが変態を生ぜしめるが，三部門すべての同時的変態は不可能であるというものである。総資本内部の価値と使用価値のこの矛盾の解決は同時に，二部門表式の結果生じたような総資本の剩余価値生産と蓄積との間の同一性を破壊する。この矛盾はつまり，第I部門，第II部門のなかで生産された余剰価値が資本と収入とに分離される場合にのみ止揚されうる。資本として作用する剩余価値部分は蓄積され，収入として作用する剩余価値部分は，資本としてではなく「不再生産的」財の購入に充用されるのである。それゆえ，剰余価値はいまや3つの部分から構成される。一部は不変資本の蓄積に，一部は可変資本の蓄積に，そして第三の部分は収入として「不再生産的」財との交換に充用されるものである。したがって再生産表式は以下のような構造になる。 I) II) III) rm1，rm2，rm3は資本としてではなく収入として機能する各部門の剰余価値部分である。それらは生産的資本に転化せず，消費され，決定的に生産過程から切離される。 こうしてふたたび，総資本の変態がおこなわれうる。四角で囲まれた部分は，その部門内で変態を果す。総資本のその他の構成部分のあいだには交換関係が生ずるが，ここでは詳細に検討するつもりはない。しかし，この点に関連して重要なのは，第III部門の不変資本·可変資本·蓄積された資本が第I部門·第II部門の生産手段·生活手段との交換によって生産的資本に転化するという事実である。つまり，第I部門·第II部門内部で生産された剰余価値の一部，rm2は資本に転化するかわりに「不再生産」財に転化する。当然rm3も資本に転化することはない。けれども，ここではこの点が重要なのではない。 というのは，第III部門の剩余価値のこの部分は第III部門自体の内部で実現されるからである。第III部門の商品資本が生産的資本に転化する交換は，それゆえ等式 によって表わされうる。 ここからつぎのことが明らかである。総資本の蓄積はもはや個別資本おのおのから生じた剰余価値の総量と同一ではない。総資本の蓄積は総剰余価値量マイナス第III部門生産総価値と等しい。 第III部門で費やされる資本は総資本の立場からみれば，総資本の蓄積に寄与しないから不生産的である。それは賃労働を充用し，この賃労働は第III部門に投下された資本のために一定量の剩余価値を生みだす，したがって，第III部門の個別資本にとってこの労働は，資本主義的にみれば生産的である。けれどもこのことは総資本については妥当しない。というのは第III部門の剰余価値と資本とはただ第I·第II部門における相応の剩余価値部分を代価としてのみ実現されうるものだからである。人間労働の生産物が商品として現われ，労働生産性が資本の利潤として現われるような物神崇拝的経済においては，「不再生産」財の生産が資本主義的には生産的なこととして現われうるということがありうる（奢侈品，軍需品生産をなす資本家はそこから利潤をひきだすからである）。しかし，総資本の再生産の分析が示しているのは，生産された剩余価値が他部門における資本蓄積の相応する部分を破砕する故に，こうした生産は実際には資本主義的にみれば不生産的である，ということである。第III部門においても資本が蓄積されるという事実から，この蓄積が第I部門，第II部門の代価によっておこなわれるということを看過すべきではない。さらにまた第III部門における資本もまた，第I部門，第II部門での剰余価値を代価にして補塡されねばならず，その結果，総蓄積はただ単に第III部門の蓄積分だけではなく第III部門の全生産価値分だけ減少せしめられるのである。 すなわち，第III部門の個々の資本家にとって利潤として現われるものは，実際には全体系の収益性にとっての損失なのである。「不再生産」財は事実上，剩余価値を生産的資本に転化しえない唯一の生産物である。それらは資本として蓄積されえないからである。それらの変態は他の資本の剩余価値部分を収入へ転化することによって，つまり，その資本としての性格を破壊することによって生ずるのである。個々の資本家にとって生産的労働として現われるものが総資本の光にてらしてみれば不生産的労働であることが示される。総資本にとって，生産的労働概念は資本が再生産過程において多数の資本の交換関係によって媒介されることを視野に入れた規定にまで拡げられねばならない。 第III部門の発展は総資本の構造内部で非資本主義的要素が発展することと同じになる。すなわち，全社会的生産が資本主義的基礎のうえでおこなわれ，フォーマル全社会的労働が賃労働として資本に包摂されるゆえに形式的な資本主義の構造は変化しないままであるにもかかわらず，こうした構造の内部では資本それ自体に矛盾する要素が発展する。剰余価値の一部は資本として機能することをやめ，収 入となる。価値が新たな価値の蓄積のための前提たることを部分的にやめ，資本蓄積のための生産が部分的に消費のための生産に座をゆずる。さもなくば消費は蓄積の裏面以外のものたりえないという意味で資本に従属しているのであるが，ここでは資本の一部が消費に捧げられている。すなわち，生産は部分的に価値のための生産たることをやめ，消費のための生産となる。しかし，このことは資本の概念と矛盾するのである。 資本の価値増殖のための生産はつねに，不生産的消費のための生産という自らの反対物をともなう。剰余価値生産はつねにこの剰余価値の一部の収 入への転化を内包し，それゆえ生産的労働は同じくつねに自らの反対物，すなわち不生産的労働ないし労働ぬきの不生産的消費をともなう。しかしながら資本どしての資本は自らの価値増殖をたえず拡大しなければならないし，あらゆる種類の消費はこれに従属しなければならないし，あらゆる種類の労働は生産的労働にならねばならない。”翻译为中文","output":"被四角围住的资本部分的转变并不会引发麻烦。其原因是，这些转变与我们迄今为止所观察到的两部门表式中的再生产分析相一致，它们发生在第一部门和第二部门各自内部的市场中。第一部门和第二部门剩余部分的转变，根据两部门表式的类比，也许能在包含第一部门和第二部门的单一市场中完成。那么，第三部门的资本如何实现成为生产资本的转变呢？此处明显地，不可能有只有一次的转变。因为如果第三部门的固定资本、可变资本或积累的资本通过与第一部门、第二部门的交换转变为生产形态，那么第一、第二部门则无法实现从商品形态到生产形态的转变。因为，这将意味着他们拥有了“非再生产性”的、无法转换为生产性资本的财产。由此产生的替代结果是，第一部门、第二部门或第三部门可以实现转变，但三个部门的同时转变是不可能的。总资本内部的价值与使用价值之间的这一矛盾的解决同时也破坏了两部门表式所产生的、总资本的剩余价值生产与积累之间的同一性。这一矛盾只能通过在第一部门、第二部门内生产的剩余价值被分为资本和收入的情况下被解决。作为资本运作的剩余价值部分被积累，而作为收入运作的剩余价值部分则用于购买非再生产性财产，而不是作为资本。因此，剩余价值现在由三部分构成：一部分用于固定资本的积累，一部分用于可变资本的积累，第三部分作为收入用于与“非再生产性”财产的交换。因此，再生产表式呈现如下结构： I) II) III) rm1，rm2，rm3代表作为收入而非资本运作的各部门的剩余价值部分。它们不转换为生产性资本，被消费，并最终与生产过程脱节。 因而，总资本的转变再次发生。被四角围住的部分在其部门内实现转变。总资本的其他构成部分之间发生交换关系，但这里不打算详细讨论。然而，此处相关的重要点是，第三部门的固定资本、可变资本、积累的资本通过与第一部门、第二部门的生产手段、生活手段的交换而转换为生产资本。这意味着，部分在第一部门、第二部门内部生产的剩余价値rm2而非转换为资本，而是转换为“非再生产性”财产。当然，rm3也不会转换为资本。但是，重要的不是这一点。 因为，第三部门的剩余价值的这一部分是在第三部门本身内部实现的。因此，第三部门的商品资本转变为生产资本的交换因此可以通过等式表示。 从这里可以明确的是：总资本的积累不再与每个个别资本产生的剩余价值总量相等。总资本积累等于总剩余价值量减去第三部门生产的总价值。 第三部门所花费的资本，从总资本的角度来看，因为不促进总资本的积累而是非生产性的。它使用雇佣劳动，并且这些劳动为第三部门投入的资本生产了一定量的剩余价值，因此，对于第三部门的个别资本来说，这种劳动是在资本主义意义上是生产性的。然而，这对于总资本来说并不适用，因为第三部门的剩余价值和资本只能通过代替第一部门、第二部门相应的剩余价值部分来实现。在以商品形式出现的人类劳动成果和以资本利润形式出现的劳动生产率的商品化经济中，可能出现“非再生产性”财产的生产在资本主义上看似是生产性的（因为生产奢侈品、军需品的资本家从中获得利润）。然而，总资本的再生产分析所展示的是，所生产的剩余价值因破坏其他部门的相应的资本积累部分而实际上在资本主义上是非生产性的。即使在第三部门也发生资本积累的事实，也不应忽视这种积累是通过第一部门、第二部门的代价来完成的。此外，第三部门的资本也必须通过第一部门、第二部门的剩余价值来补充，结果，总积累不仅减少了第三部门的积累部分，而且减少了第三部门的全部生产价值部分。 即，对于第三部门的个别资本家而言，作为利润出现的东西，实际上对于整个系统的盈利性而言是损失的。“非再生产性”财产实质上是唯一不能转换为生产性资本的生产物。它们不能作为资本积累，因为它们的转变通过将其他资本的剩余价值部分转化为收入来实现，即通过破坏其作为资本的性质。总资本角度下，出现为个别资本家的生产性劳动的东西被证明是非生产性劳动。对于总资本而言，生产性劳动的概念必须扩展到考虑资本在再生产过程中通过多个资本的交换关系来媒介的规定。 第三部门的发展相当于总资本结构内部非资本主义要素的发展。这意味着，尽管全社会的生产在资本主义基础上进行，形式上全社会劳动作为雇佣劳动被资本包容，因此资本主义结构的形式不发生变化，但在这种结构内部，与资本本身相矛盾的要素发展。剩余价值的一部分停止作为资本运作，而成为收入。价值作为新价值积累的前提部分停止，并且部分为资本积累的生产让位给消费的生产。否则，消费仅仅是资本积累的背面之外的东西，意味着它依赖于资本，但这里是部分资本被用于消费。即生产部分停止为价值的生产，而成为消费的生产。然而，这与资本的概念相矛盾。 为资本的价值增长而生产总是伴随其反面，即为非生产性消费而生产。剩余价值生产总是内含其一部分剩余价值转化为收入，因此生产性劳动也总是伴随其反面，即非生产性劳动或无劳动的非生产性消费。然而，资本作为一个整体必须不断扩大自己的价值增长，所有类型的消费必须服从于此，所有类型的劳动都必须成为生产性劳动。"},{"instruction":"请将“歴史的にみて，こういうことは本源的蓄積過程と工業化とともにおこった。この過程ではあらゆる労働が資本に包摂され，生産的労働に転化される。農民は農業プロレタリアートおよび工業プロレタリアートになる。形成されつつある国内市場は資本拡張の作用以外のなにものでもない。消費財の需要は労働力の再生産のために存在し，蓄積する可変資本の表現である。他の階級戦線では地主の不生産的消費が攻撃される。工業ブルジョアジーと農村貴族との間の闘争は，資本蓄積の障害を除去しようとして，貴族の不生産的消費を侵食する。 マルサスのような著者たちはこの時期に過少消費理論から出発して不生産的消費の擁護論者となるが，彼らは資本蓄積過程における資本の弱さを反映している。すなわち，その弱さとは，労働生産性の資本主義的成長によって駆逐された労働者を再び就労させるほど十分はやく蓄積がおこなわれないということであり，このことから不生産的消費の必要性が生ずる。しかし，蓄積がすでにひとつの進んだ段階に到達してしまっている資本主義的発展の時期においては，それとは違った状態を呈している。この段階では過剰蓄積とそれに相応した産業予備軍形成の傾向とは，蓄積があまりに緩慢におこなわれるということに拠っているのではなく，資本がその収益性の限界に達してしまい，さらなる蓄積をおこなうことがそれに十分な剩余価値量の不足のゆえにもはや不可能であるということに拠っているのである。 資本蓄積がすでにひとつの進んだ段階に達してしまっている時期には，資本蓄積の不足のゆえの過少消費理論と失業の不安とが再び登場するとしても，それは当然マルサスとはちがった文脈においてあらわれる。つまり，資本が未熟すぎるゆえに蓄積が脆弱ということが問題なのではなく，過剰蓄積傾向が重要なのである。ケインズは消費拡大が蓄積拡大の代替になるとき資本は危機に見舞われるということを知っていた。したがって彼は消費拡大をも，ヨリ小さな悪とみなしている。資本主義的解決はもっぱら資本蓄積の新たな高まりのうちに存しうるということを彼は十分に知っているのである。資本にとっての問題の所在をこのように明確に認識していることでもって，ケインズは理論において労働党内の彼の信奉者たちをはるかに凌駕している。彼らは資本主義安定化のための現代的方法を労働者の消費拡大のうちに認めていたのであった。もちろんケインズも政治的理由から消費の拡大を，失業の体制的危機あるいは全般的な経済恐慌を防ぐものとして選択するのであるが，けれども資本主義社会そのものの否定-消費のための生産-によって恐慌を回避するような資本主義社会は危機状況にある資本主義である。それゆえ，ひとつの逆説が生じる。 すなわち，戦後資本主義の安定化要因として称揚された国家的介入こそまさしく，資本主義の危機のひとつの決定的側面，つまり資本主義の否定による資本主義の安定化，を示すものなのである。 III 利潤率低下法則と国家支出の機能。「ヶインズ主義」国家の限界 ポール·マティックの大きな業績，それは，現代資本主義の新たな現象諸形態はマルクスの価値論の有効性を何ら変えるものではない，反対に，それらが蓄積法則の論理必然的帰結である，ということをマルクス蓄積理論に即して指摘したことである。マティックは，後期資本主義に関する議論のなかで出ている問題設定のいくつかが誤った前提に立っていると指摘することができた。とくにバラン-スウィージーもあずかっている見解，つまり価値法則の有効性にとっての前提は自由競争であって，独占的市場においてはもはやこのような有効性は存在しないとする見解は根底から斥けられたように思われる。マティックが指摘したように，価値論はその論理的地位が経験的な市場諸関係の地位ではないゆえに，けっして相対的価格の理論ではないのである。独占価格が価値と一致しえない（価値と価格がけっして一致しえないのと同様に）という事実は，それゆえ自明のことであって，価値論の「反証」とは無関係なことである。なぜなら，マルクスにとって市場諸現象ならびに資本の集中化や市場の独占化は生産諸関係からはじめて説明されうるものだからである。独占価格は価値法則を土台にしてのみ理解でき，ある法則からの背反はその法則自身を土台にしてのみ理解されるべきである。価値法則は生産諸関係が分業と私的所有に基づいている社会における中心的構造の表現であり，その社会の歴史的諸傾向の表現である。このような生産諸関係を基礎にして，人間労働の生産物は消費対象としてあらわれず，資本としてあらわれる-人間労働の生産性はそれゆえ，資本の価値増殖のうちに表現されるのである。社会的総資本の蓄積こそが個別資本の蓄積やさらにまた諸価格が経験的交換諸関係として理解され，それゆえ，科学的に説明可能となるような枠組なのである。 蓄積理論と不生産的労働の理論は同時に，現代資本主義についてのあらゆる 理論が直面していると思われる二つの根本的側面を説明することを可能にする。すなわち，一方では最近25年間の資本主義の外見上の経済的成功ならびに深刻な恐慌の不存在という面と，他方，こうした外見上の繁栄下でみとめられうる恐慌側面という二面である。 国家の需要拡大は再生産過程に対して，「不再生産」財の生産と同じような作用を及ぼす。つまり，国家需要は，第III部門が資本の一部から資本の資本としての機能を奪いさるのと同じように，剰余価値の一部を収 入に転化する。ヴイルトシャフト国家は経 済態から一定の貨幣額を租税と公債という二つの主要形態で奪う。この基金は資本として蓄積されえず，総資本が価値増殖に充用する手段の額を減ずる。もちろん，この手段はなかんずく資本家たちによってもたらされた商品の購入に用立てられ，そのさい資本家たちは逆に，売却によって自分たちの利潤を実現する。けれども，この事実から，「不再生産」財の場合と同様，誤った結論を導き出してはならない。たとえば軍需産業において生みだされる剰余価値は軍需品の一部のうちに体現され，自らのうちに含んでいる全価値，すなわち剰余価値のみならず軍需産業において費やされた不変資本と可変資本をもまた実現する。軍需産業の剰余価値が総資本の蓄積の視点からみれば失われるというばかりか，生産物の総価値は軍需品の支払いのために国家がわがものとした他の産業の剰余価値の一部によって実現されねばならないのである。それゆえ，軍需品の総費用は総剰余価値から控除されねばならず，総資本の蓄積にとって相応の損失をなす。この損失はそのときどきの，国家のために生産する部門の絶対的大きさならびにこの部門の有機的構成にかかっている。すなわち，国家のために生産する部門が大きくなればなるほど，それだけ一層，不生産的部門の生産物を実現するために生産的部門から奪いとらなければならない剰余価値は大きくなる。そして，不生産的部門の有機的構成が高まれば高まるほど，より多くの剩余価値が生産的部門から，利潤率の均衡化の過程を通じて流出しなければならない。このことから，正味の利潤率の一般的低落が生じ，さらに重要な点として蓄積率の緩慢化が生じる。蓄積率の緩慢化が意味するのは，資本主義的生産の一部が資本の価値増殖にむけられないで消費にむけられるということである。資本形成を犠牲にして消費部面が拡大することは，たしかに過剰蓄積をともなう収容力過剰へ積極的な作用を及ぼす。つまり，過剰蓄積恐慌のために価値増殖しえず（収容力過剰），それに照応した産業予備軍の増大を解消しないようになるであろう資本部分は，国家による需要によって投資可能性を見出す。そうすることによって社会的総消費は減らず，総需要と総生産はその水準を保つのである。しかし，資本主義的消費，すなわち蓄積のさまざまな要素に由来する消費にかわって，資本蓄積に寄与するかわりに剰余価値を破壊する不生産的消費が登場する。それゆえ，総需要と総生産が水準を保つという事実は資本にとって，ひとつの弱い気安めにすぎないのである。なぜなら，非資本主義的な需要刺激はあるささやかな資本形成率のなかで凝固するからである。”翻译为中文","output":"从历史上看，这种情况发生在原始积累过程和工业化过程中。在这个过程中，所有劳动被资本吸收，转化为生产性劳动。农民成为了农业无产阶级和工业无产阶级。正在形成的国内市场不过是资本扩张的一个作用体现。消费品的需求存在是为了劳动力的再生产，是积累的可变资本的体现。在其他阶级斗争中，地主的非生产性消费受到攻击。工业资产阶级和农村贵族之间的斗争旨在消除资本积累的障碍，侵蚀贵族的非生产性消费。 和马尔萨斯这样的作者在这一时期从不足消费理论出发，成为非生产性消费的辩护者，他们反映了资本积累过程中资本的脆弱。即，脆弱在于，资本主义生产力的增长驱逐了被排斥的工人，积累的速度不足以让他们重新就业，由此产生非生产性消费的必要性。然而，在资本主义发展已经达到一个先进阶段的时期，情况有所不同。在这个阶段，过度积累及其相应的产业后备军的形成趋势，并非是因为积累进行得太慢，而是因为资本达到了利润极限，进一步的积累由于缺乏足够的剩余价值量已不再可能。 当资本积累已经达到一个先进阶段的时候，即使再次出现不足消费理论和失业恐慌，它们也会在一个不同的背景下出现。即问题不在于积累脆弱是因为资本不成熟，而是过度积累趋势更为重要。凯恩斯知道，当消费扩大成为积累扩大的替代品时，资本将面临危机。因此，他将消费扩大视为较小的恶。凯恩斯充分知道，资本主义的解决方案完全存在于新一轮资本积累的增长之中。正是凭借这种清晰的问题认识，凯恩斯在理论上远远超过了工党内的他的信徒们。他们认为，现代化的资本主义稳定之道在于扩大工人的消费。当然，出于政治原因，凯恩斯也选择扩大消费，作为一种避免失业结构性危机或全面经济恐慌的手段，但是一个为了消费而生产、以避免恐慌的资本主义社会，实际上是处于危机中的资本主义。因此，产生了一个悖论。 即被赞扬为战后资本主义稳定化因素的国家干预，恰恰显示了资本主义危机的一个决定性方面，即通过资本主义的否定来实现资本主义的稳定化。 保罗·马蒂克的主要成就在于，他指出了现代资本主义的新现象形态并没有改变马克思的价值论的有效性，相反，这些现象是积累规律逻辑必然结果的指示。马蒂克能够指出，后期资本主义讨论中出现的一些问题设置是基于错误的前提。特别是巴兰-斯威齐等人的观点，即价值规律有效性的前提是自由竞争，而在垄断市场中这种有效性不复存在的观点，似乎被彻底驳斥。正如马蒂克所指出的，价值论不是相对价格理论，因为其逻辑地位并非基于经验性市场关系。垄断价格不能与价值一致（正如价值和价格永远不能一致一样）的事实因此是显而易见的，与价值论的“反驳”无关。因为对于马克思来说，市场现象和资本集中或市场垄断化只能基于生产关系来解释。垄断价格只能基于价值规律理解，任何规律的背离只能基于该规律本身来理解。价值规律是基于分工和私有制的社会中中心结构的表现，是这种社会的历史趋势的表现。基于这样的生产关系，人类劳动的产物不作为消费对象出现，而是作为资本出现——人类劳动的生产力因此在资本的价值增长中得到体现。社会总资本的积累是个别资本的积累，以及价格作为经验性交换关系变成科学可解释的框架。 积累理论和非生产性劳动理论同时使解释现代资本主义面临的两个根本方面成为可能。即一方面是近25年来资本主义的外表上的经济成功和严重恐慌的缺失，另一方面是在这种外貌上的繁荣下可以认识到的恐慌方面。 国家需求扩大对再生产过程产生了与“非再生产性”商品生产相似的作用。即国家需求将剩余价值的一部分转化为收入，就像第三部门从资本中剥夺资本作为资本的功能一样。国家以租税和公债这两种主要形式从经济体中夺走一定量的货币。这一基金无法作为资本积累，减少了总资本用于价值增长的手段的量。当然，这些手段主要用于购买资本家们带来的商品，从而他们通过销售实现自己的利润。然而，不应从这一事实中得出错误的结论，正如在“非再生产性”商品情况下一样。例如，军需产业产生的剩余价值体现在部分军需品中，并在其中实现其包含的全部价值，即不仅是剩余价值，也包括在军需产业中使用的不变资本和可变资本。从总资本积累的视角来看，并不是说军需产业的剩余价值就此丧失，而是产品的总价值必须通过国家支付军需品所夺取的其他产业部分的剩余价值来实现。因此，军需品的总成本必须从总剩余价值中扣除，对总资本的积累构成相应损失。这种损失取决于当时为国家生产的部门的绝对规模以及该部门的有机构成。即国家为其生产的部门越大，就必须从生产性部门中夺取更多的剩余价值来实现非生产性部门的生产物，如果非生产性部门的有机构成增加，就必须有更多的剩余价值通过利润率均衡化过程从生产性部门流出。这导致了净利润率的总体下降，以及更为重要的积累率的放缓。积累率放缓的意味着，资本主义生产的一部分未被用于资本的价值增长而是被用于消费。牺牲资本形成以扩大消费领域，无疑对过剩积累导致的容量过剩产生积极作用。即，由于过剩积累恐慌而无法增值的资本部分（容量过剩），通过国家需求找到投资可能性。这样，社会总消费不减少，总需求和总产出保持其水平。然而，资本主义消费，即源于积累的各种要素的消费，被破坏剩余价值的非生产性消费所取代。因此，总需求和总产出保持水平的事实对于资本来说，只不过是一个薄弱的安慰剂。因为非资本主义的需求刺激在一定的资本形成率中凝固。"},{"instruction":"请将“資本形成率は当然のことながら，一般的な収益諸条件すなわち剰余価値生産が十分に再建された場合にだけーもちろん国家需要の拡大に依存することなく-上昇しうる。〔かくして，〕資本蓄積のあらゆる危機状況においてと同様，「ケインズ主義的」国家介入の時期においても資本家は資本の一般的収益性を再建しようと努めねばならない。こうした努力に対してケインズがさしのべるのは，もちろん非常につつましやかな援助だけである。労働生産性向上のための方法は『一般理論』とともにあらわれてきたのではなく，資本それ自体とともにあらわれてきたのである。つまり，労働強度の上昇，合理化，集積によって，ひとことでいえば，相対的剰余価値の抽出増大によって，である。 こういう目的のために，国家は当然役立ちうる。それは，国家が合理化と資本の収益性再建を国家的手段でもって支援することによる。しかしながらこういうことはすべて，国家の「ケインズ主義的」活動とはもう何ら関係ない。というのは，資本の典型的機能の支援，すなわち相対的剰余価値の増大を支えることが肝心だからである。ここでは，ジョーン·ロビンソンがマルクスに対して使ったヴォルテールの警句をケインズに対して引用することができよう。魔法の力によって羊の群を殺すことは，それらに一斉に強力な一服の砒素を投じれば可能である。同様に，国家需要のたすけをかりて資本主義を恐慌から救うことは，搾取を一斉に強めれば可能である。 したがってケインズ主義の積極的効果は，なによりもまず，さもなくば遊休化するはずの資本と労働力が生産過程に入れられるという点に限られる。この方法で経済恐慌の古典的形態-過剰生産と失業-が阻止される。恐慌よりもこうした効果の方が選ばれるのは，ただ単に政治的理由からだけではない。資本主義は生産と消費の恒常的拡大を保証しうるのだという資本主義社会の根底的イデオロギーに手を触れないままにしておくためにも，こうした効果が選びとられるのである。しかし，資本にとって過剰生産と失業は依然として存在するし，しかもいまやもっぱら新しい形態でそれらは現われる。浪費のための生産と不生産的労働という形で，である。それゆえ，国家の介入の「景気刺激」効果によって生産が拡大するということが意味するのは，なによりも，恐慌がおこれば消滅するであろうような生産部分の実現なのである。しかし，生産のこういう「拡大」は消費の拡大であって資本の拡大ではないことはすでにみたとおりである。 こういう見方とは反対に，バランとスウィージーは生産のこうした拡大が私的資本の拡大と同じであるという見地に立っているようにみえる。すなわち，独占的市場構造における問題は競争資本主義における問題と根本的に違う，そう彼らは信じている。彼らの見解によれば，古典的モデルは資源の完全な利用，最低生活水準での賃金水準ということを仮定して，剰余価値が政府支出の唯一の財源であるということを含意している。しかし，これは独占資本主義においてはもはや妥当しない，と彼らはいう。というのは，有効需要の不足とそれに相応する形での資源の不十分な利用という状況にあっては，国家財政による生産は私的資本の蓄積の負担になるのではなく，追加的生産をなすからである，とされる。ある箇所でバランとスウィージーは，総資本はその一部を不生産的に充用することによって損しないばかりか反対にもうける，とさえ主張している。ところで諸資源は国家支出がなければ完全に利用されつくすことはなく，それゆえ所得が減少するであろうということは，もちろん一つの事実である。収容力過剰の国家的利用をたすけとして得られる所得を，こういう利用なしに得られる所得とくらべれば，所得は増大するということができる。しかし，いかなる場合でもこうした所得の増大を私的資本の蓄積と混同してはならない。なるほど，収容力は国家支出なしにはずっとわずかしか利用されないという限りではバランとスウィージーは正しい。しかしこのことは，私的資本の蓄積がこのような国家支出のための手段を用立てなければならないという事実を何ら変更するものではない。結局最後に残るのは，収容力過剰か，この余剰を国家(67)の側が不生産的に利用するかの二者択一である。このような二者択一的選択肢は実は資本にとっての選択肢ではない。なぜなら，資本の一部が資本主義的に生産的に充用されえないゆえに，両可能性とも損失をもたらすからである。上記のような方法で所得の減少が阻まれ，資本家の特定のグループの利潤が保証されたとしても，そのさい総資本は収容力過剰の場合と同様，損失をこうむる(68)のである。 バランとスウィージーは，さもなくば過剰となる収容力にとって国家支出が投資可能性を提供するから国家支出は一般的収益性の水準向上に寄与すると述(69)べたが，こういう主張は彼ら自身別のところで明示的に斥けているケインズ的乗数理論に暗合するものである。この理論によれば，所得に及ぼす国家需要の作用はこの需要の大きさに制限されることはない。そのさい，この需要によって形成される所得は一部が消費のために支出されるが，そのことを通してさらなる需要を形成するという点が顧慮されるべきである。このさらなる需要によって形成される所得の一部は，再び新たな需要をもたらす，などなど。この繰り返される所得形成の効果は，形成された各所得のうち一部しか消費に充用されないゆえに，当然のことながら徐々に減退する。総所得のなかで消費が占める割合が大きくなればなるほど，乗数も大きくなる。所得の乗数効果が汲みっ(70)くされるのがより遅れるからである。これに照応して，国家需要（たとえば1／2の消費性向をもつ指数価値100の軍需品需要）は，国家への軍需品売却によって生ずる価値100の所得のうち50は消費財のために支払われるべく作用する。この50を利用して生ずる所得のうち，またつぎには25が支払われる，等々。このことは100の国家支出のために200の所得増加ということを明らかにしている。 相応して，2／3の消費性向の場合には，300の所得増加という結果になる。前者の場合乗数は2であり，後者は3である。 イルージョンこうした考えの幻 想的性格は，商品流通と貨幣流通を区別して考えると明白になる。われわれが社会の総生産を考えるとき，国家支出の価値100は，100の貨幣額以外のなにものでもなく，この100の貨幣額は国家が租税の形で全経済体系から引き出してきたものである。もし，国家がこの貨幣で軍需品を買うとすれば，そのことでもって全経済体系から国家が税の形で奪った貨幣がただ経済体系に戻されるだけである。しかし，この過程で価値100の財貨は経済体系から国家に移されている。したがって結果は，この体系にとって価値100の財貨の正味損失である。いまやこの貨幣が経済体系内部の商品流通に使われる。流通はさきに再生産表式を論じたさいに描かれた仕方に対応している。しかし，この流通がおこなわれるのは国家支出がなされたからではなく，個別資本が価値100の貨幣額によって流通する商品を生産していたからであるということ，これは明らかである。この貨幣額（あるいはその一部）があるものの手から他のものの手に移ることは，国家支出による所得の「創出」とはみなされえない。実際にはむしろ，商品があるものの手から他のものに移行する（商品流通）のにつづいておこる貨幣の移行（貨幣流通）が要点なのである。所得が貨幣流通によって「剰出され」るかのように考える幻想は，貨幣流通が商品流通の起動力の(71)ようにみえる資本主義的生産関係の物神崇拝性に基づいている。”翻译为中文","output":"资本形成率当然只有在一般盈利条件，即剩余价值生产得到充分重建的情况下——当然不依赖于国家需求的扩大——才能上升。因此，在所有资本积累的危机情况中，就像在“凯恩斯主义”国家干预的时期一样，资本家必须努力重建资本的一般盈利性。对这些努力，凯恩斯自然只能提供非常谦逊的帮助。提高劳动生产率的方法并没有随着《一般理论》的出现而出现，而是与资本本身一起出现的。也就是说，通过提高劳动强度、合理化、集中化，简而言之，通过增加相对剩余价值的提取来实现。 国家自然可以在这个目的上发挥作用。那是通过国家手段支持合理化和资本盈利性重建来实现的。然而，这些都与国家的“凯恩斯主义”活动无关。因为，支持资本的典型功能，即支持相对剩余价值增长才是关键。在这里，我们可以引用伏尔泰对马克思使用的格言来指向凯恩斯。用魔法的力量杀死一群羊，就像给它们统一服用强烈剧毒一样可行。同样，通过国家需求的帮助拯救资本主义免于恐慌，就像一次性增强剥削一样可行。 因此，凯恩斯主义的积极效果主要限于，否则将处于闲置状态的资本和劳动力被纳入生产过程中。通过这种方式，经济萧条的传统形式——过度生产和失业——被阻止了。选择这种效果而非经济萧条，不仅仅是出于政治原因。也是为了保持资本主义社会的根本意识形态不受干扰，即资本主义可以保证生产和消费的持续扩大。然而，对资本而言，过度生产和失业仍然存在，并且现在以一种新的形式出现：为了浪费而生产和非生产性劳动。因此，国家干预的“经济刺激”效果导致生产扩张意味着，恐慌可能消除的生产部分的实现。但是，如我们所见，这种“扩张”的生产是消费的扩张，而不是资本的扩张。 与这种看法相反，巴兰和斯威齐似乎站在认为这种生产扩张与私人资本的扩张相同的立场上。也就是说，他们相信，在垄断市场结构中的问题与竞争资本主义中的问题根本不同。据他们观点，古典模型假设了资源的完全利用和最低生活水平的工资水平，这意味着剩余价值是政府支出的唯一资金来源。但是，他们说，在垄断资本主义中，这已不再适用。因为在有效需求不足和相应资源利用不足的情况下，国家财政的生产不是私人资本积累的负担，而是构成额外生产。巴兰和斯威齐在某处甚至声称，总资本通过不生产性使用其一部分不仅不会受损，反而会获利。当然，如果没有国家支出，资源将永远不会得到完全利用，因此收入将减少，这无疑是一个事实。如果国家对超额产能的使用成为帮助，则相对于无此使用的收入来说，收入将增加。但是，无论如何都不应将这种收入增长与私人资本的积累混淆。的确，在没有国家支出的情况下，产能将只有很少被利用，从这个意义上说，巴兰和斯威齐是正确的。但这并不改变私人资本必须为这种国家支出提供手段的事实。最终留下的选择是产能过剩或者国家以不生产性方式使用这个剩余。这种二选一的选择实际上并不是资本的选择。因为，部分资本由于不能资本主义生产性地使用，因此两种可能性都将带来损失。即便以这种方式阻止了收入减少，保证了特定资本家群体的利润，总资本仍将像在产能过剩的情况下一样，承受损失。 巴兰和斯威齐声称，由于国家支出为否则将过剩的产能提供了投资可能性，因此国家支出有助于提高一般盈利性水平。但这种声明与他们自己在其他地方明确否定的凯恩斯乘数理论相矛盾。根据这一理论，国家需求对收入的影响不仅限于这种需求的规模。应考虑到这种需求形成的收入的一部分将用于消费，通过这一消费形成进一步的需求。由此形成的收入的一部分将再次产生新的需求，等等。这种反复的收入形成效应将自然逐渐减弱，因为形成的各项收入中只有一部分用于消费。消费在总收入中所占比例越大，乘数也就越大，因为延迟了乘数效应的耗尽。相应地，国家需求（例如消费倾向为1/2的指数值100的军需品需求）将作用于国家购买军需品而形成的价值100的收入中的50，将用于支付消费品。利用这50形成的收入中，接下来25将支付，等等。这表明了100的国家支出将导致200的收入增加。 相应地，如果消费倾向为2/3，则结果将是300的收入增加。前者的乘数为2，后者为3。 这种想法的幻觉性质在区分商品流通和货币流通时变得明显。当我们考虑社会的总生产时，国家支出的价值100不过是100的货币量而已，这100的货币是国家以税收形式从整个经济体系中提取的。如果国家用这笔钱购买军需品，则这只意味着国家以税收形式从经济体系中夺走的货币仅仅被返回经济体系。但是，在这个过程中，价值100的商品已从经济体系转移到国家。因此，结果是对此系统来说，价值100的商品的净损失。现在，这笔货币在经济体系内部的商品流通中被使用。流通对应于我们讨论再生产表式时描述的方式。然而，这种流通发生是因为国家支出而不是因为个别资本生产了价值100的货币量的商品，这一点是显而易见的。货币量（或其一部分）从一个人手中转移到另一个人手中，不能被视为国家支出造成的收入的“创造”。实际上，接着商品从一个人转移到另一个人（商品流通）发生的是货币的转移（货币流通）。认为收入通过货币流通“产生”的幻觉基于资本主义生产关系的物神崇拜性质，这种关系让货币流通看起来像是商品流通的驱动力。"},{"instruction":"请将“所得の乗数化はそれゆえ，国家が経済体系から価値100の商品を奪い，それと交換に，もともと租税の形で国家が徴収した価値100の貨幣を与えるあとにおこなわれる商品流通（商品形態から貨幣形態，それから生産的資本の形態への移行）以外のなにものでもない。それゆえ，商品流通はなんら追加利潤を生産せず，100の剰余価値量（それに相応する価値の商品に体現された）が失われていったのちに，保存された利潤を実現する。このような方法で実現された利潤は，国家によって与えられた価値100の貨幣とは何の関係もないといわねばならない。国家の機能は，国家が相応の流通手段の額を用立て，そのことでもって流通にあるインパクトを与えることに限られる。こういう方法で流通の側から生じうる障害を容易に克服することは可能であるし，この点に国家需要の効果を還元することができる。けれども，ケインズ主義的幻想とはまったく異なって，生産された全剩余価値の総計が流通によって変えられることはない。国家需要は流通への順調な効果によって，実現される利潤が生産された利潤以下におち込むのを阻止することができる。それと同時に，恐慌の古典的形態のひとつの典型的効果，すなわち，流通過程における停滞によって生ぜしめられる連鎖反応-この連鎖反応によって，低度の実現による全損失が，利潤率の低下による収益性の一般的損失を上回る-が消滅する。しかし，総剰余価値は，この経済恐慌の修正形態によって増大させられないばかりか，われわれが示してきたように国家支出に相応する額だけ減少する。恐慌形態の一変化によっても，資本それ自体の内的構造に基づく恐慌の原因を国家支出が断ち切ることは不可能である。軍需産業の個々の資本家にとって，その生産の価値は貨幣に変わり，あらためて生産的資本に転化する。たとえ国家のために生産するとしても，そうである。同様に，武器製造者に機械を売り，その労働者に消費財を売る資本家たちも自分たちの生産物をふたたび貨幣に転化し，この貨幣をふたたび生産的資本に転化する。したがって，すべての個々の資本家にはあたかも国家需要が自分たちの所得を「創出する」かのようにみえるようになる。資本家にとっては何が生産されるかはどうでもよいことなのであり，そうやって彼が生む利潤が決定的だからである。個々の資本家は自分たちによって支払われるべき租税の形で部分的にしか総資本の過程に関知しなくなる。資本家ばかりでなく労働者も租税を支払わなければならないという事実は，労働者から徴収される租税もまた不払い労働を成すということに何ら変更を加えない。それは資本ではなく国家が取得する搾取総量の一部なのである。総資本にとってこのことが意味するのは，国家需要の価値に相応する商品が経済に対する補償なしに収用されてしまっているということである。この損失は当然，すべての資本家に配分される。おのおのの資本は，資本が貨幣形態に転化したあとで一定の貨幣額を租税の形で国家に支払い，それに相応して生産的資本もまた減少する。こういうことを媒介にして，恐慌は個別資本にとっても修正された形態で，すなわち，収容力過剰削りとられることになるのである。 公債や税金を通して国家によって融資される生産のシステムは，自らの限界を私的資本の蓄積率のうちに見出す。ただ資本が急速に蓄積する場合にのみ，国家が自らの支出と負債への利子とを支払いうるような税収が可能なのである。負債それ自体は，貨幣資本の蓄積が国家に必要な基金を用立てるのに十分な大きさのときにだけ可能である。超過支出と乗数とは，所得を「創出する」ことと無関係である。それらは，私的資本の蓄積あるいは私的剰余価値生産のひとつの反映である。この私的資本の蓄積あるいは私的剰余価値生産が不十分なとき，利潤のための生産の領域へ，消費のための生産が一層強力に侵入することによってのみ，超過支出と乗数は機能しうるのである。 これは「混合経済」のディレンマである。国家が利潤率の低下の進行を阻止しようとして，不生産的消費のための生産を高めるなら，国家はそのことによって私的資本の拡大範囲を制限することになる。社会の総消費量は国家の介入方法によってその水準を維持しうるが，資本蓄積の契機としての消費は蓄積なしの消費にとって代わられる。国家の活動の拡大に資金提供するために，私的資本は国家の活動によって狭められた範囲のなかで，利潤をあげうる蓄積諸条件を再建しなければならない。これがうまくいけば私的資本の新たな拡大の時期がはじまる。この拡大が価値増殖可能性の限界に達すると，国家はあらためてコントロールの範囲を拡張せざるをえなくなる。資本に内在的な価値増殖制限であるところのものが，私的資本の事業への国家の外的干渉として現象する。国家によって資本の範囲が狭められることは資本それ自体から同時に結果するのであり，そのあらたな拡大を問題視させる。それゆえ国家の活動はつねに，多すぎる介入と少なすぎる介入との間のむずかしい均衡をたもつべき強制に服するのである。 好転はおこりそうもない。蓄積を促進して国家支出の非常な減少を補塡するには私的な資本形成の率は弱すぎる。総剰余価値量を全面的にコントロールし，それを国家が直接的に生産に充用するに至るまでの前方への大跳躍は，総体的徴収と同じことになってしまうであろう。唯一の資本フラクションが国家を自ら運営しうる-これは現在の諸条件の下ではまったく非現実的な構想だが-場合をのぞいて，こうした跳躍は社会の根底的転換なしには実現されえない。それゆえ，市場が，依然として，国家の活動によって狭められるにもかかわらず個別資本の蓄積がおこなわれるさいの媒体でありつづけなければならない。私的資本の蓄積の強行以外に「混合経済」にとってのオルタナティヴは存在しない。 収益性諸条件の再建の機能は通常の諸状況の下での資本主義においては恐慌によって果される。しかも経済恐慌の時期における資本の集中および固定資本の一部の減価，合理化および労働力搾取の強化，非資本家階級の所得に対する資本の攻撃によって果される。国家は公然たる恐慌の形態を，「混合経済」にとって典型的な恐慌の変化された形態へと転化させるにもかかわらず，国家は不可避的に古典的恐慌の伝統的な諸機能をも継承しなければならない。こうしてはじめて，ひきっづき「混合経済」の機能の基礎である私的蓄積を再び強化することが可能なのである。したがって，古典的恐慌の推移のなかで生じる資本の再編成過程は，蓄積を促進するという目的をもって国家によって助長されなければならない。 それゆえつねに，ケインズ主義的方法は搾取の強化，資本の集中，帝国主義という古典的方法を随伴している。こうしたさまざまな方法はひきつづいて私的資本の価値増殖のなかにその根拠をもっており，ひるがえって私的資本の価値増殖は利潤率の傾向的低下のうちに限界をもっている。ここから国家活動の二面性が生まれる。一面で国家支出は，資本生産の範囲を凌駕して消費の範囲を拡張するから，資本の否定である。国家は流通領域へ介入し，生産された物財の一部を市場メカニズムの外部で実現する。このような生産物は商品ではなく，たんなる使用価値にすぎないが，しかしその費用は総資本の価値増殖に対して否定的な影響を及ぽす。こういう使用価値が生産されうるのは，総資本の蓄積がこの使用価値の生産によって損なわれない場合だけである。しかし，この生産は資本の価値増殖の諸法則性に服している。それゆえ，国家は生産領域において私的資本のために価値増殖諸条件を改善しようと試みることができる。”翻译为中文","output":"因此，所得乘数化仅仅是在国家从经济体系中夺取价值100的商品，并以原本以税收形式征收的价值100的货币交换之后进行的商品流通（从商品形式到货币形式，然后到生产性资本形式的转换）而已。因此，商品流通并不产生任何额外利润，当失去了体现在相应价值商品中的100的剩余价值量之后，才实现了保存的利润。必须说，以这种方式实现的利润与国家提供的价值100的货币没有任何关系。国家的功能仅限于提供相应的流通手段的量，从而对流通产生影响。以这种方式，可以容易地克服流通方面可能出现的障碍，并可以将国家需求的效果归结为此。但是，与凯恩斯主义的幻想完全不同，流通并不改变产生的总剩余价值的总和。国家的需求通过流通的顺利效果可以阻止实现的利润低于产生的利润。同时，防止了经济萧条的典型效果之一，即通过流通过程中的停滞引发的连锁反应——这种连锁反应使得由于实现不足而导致的总损失超过了由于利润率下降而导致的收益性的一般损失。但是，正如我们所展示的，总剩余价值不仅不会因为这种经济萧条的修改形态而增加，反而会因为国家支出相应的量而减少。经济萧条形态的变化无法通过国家支出切断基于资本自身内部结构的经济萧条原因。对于个别的军需产业资本家来说，他们的生产价值转化为货币，并再次转化为生产性资本。即便是为国家生产，也是如此。同样，向武器制造商销售机器，并向其工人销售消费品的资本家们也再次将自己的生产物转化为货币，这些货币再次转化为生产性资本。因此，所有个别资本家似乎看到，国家需求“创造”了他们的收入。对于资本家来说，生产什么并不重要，重要的是由此产生的利润。个别资本家仅以部分租税的形式对总资本过程进行了部分关注。不仅是资本家，工人也必须支付税收，这一事实并不改变从工人那里征收的税收也构成了未支付的劳动。这是国家获得的总剥削量的一部分。对总资本来说，这意味着国家需求相应价值的商品被无偿征用。这种损失当然会分配给所有资本家。每个资本在资本转化为货币形式后，需要以租税的形式支付一定量的货币给国家，相应地生产性资本也会减少。通过这种媒介，对于个别资本来说，经济萧条也以修改后的形式出现，即产能过剩被削弱。 通过债券和税收，国家资助的生产系统在私人资本积累率中找到其限制。只有在资本迅速积累的情况下，国家才可能负担自身的支出和对债务的利息支付。债务本身仅在货币资本积累足够大以提供国家所需基金时才可能。超额支出和乘数与“创造”收入无关。它们是私人资本积累或私人剩余价值生产的反映。当这些私人资本积累或私人剩余价值生产不足时，通过更强势地进入生产领域以获得利润的消费领域，超额支出和乘数才能发挥作用。 这就是“混合经济”的困境。如果国家通过增加非生产性消费的生产来阻止利润率下降，那么国家就会通过这一举措限制私人资本的扩张范围。虽然社会的总消费量可以通过国家干预方式保持其水平，但作为资本积累契机的消费将被无需积累的消费所取代。为了资助国家活动的扩大，私人资本必须在国家活动所限制的范围内重建能够实现利润的积累条件。如果这一尝试成功，私人资本的新扩张时期将开始。这一扩张到达价值增长潜力的限制时，国家将再次被迫扩大其控制范围。作为私人资本活动的外部干涉表现的是资本内在的价值增长限制。国家对资本范围的限制同时也是资本自身导致的，这导致了其新扩张的问题。因此，国家的活动总是受制于介入过多与介入不足之间艰难的平衡。 好转看起来不太可能。为了促进积累并弥补国家支出的巨大减少，私人资本形成的率太弱。向前大跨步到国家直接将剩余价值全面控制并用于生产的程度，将等同于全面征收。除了唯一的资本派系可以控制国家——在当前条件下这完全是不现实的设想——这样的跨步无法在没有社会根本转变的情况下实现。因此，市场必须继续作为个别资本积累进行时的媒介，尽管仍然被国家活动所限制。对“混合经济”而言，没有私人资本积累强制进行的替代方案。 重建盈利条件的功能在正常情况下的资本主义中通过经济萧条实现。而且是通过经济萧条时期的资本集中和固定资本的部分贬值，合理化和劳动力剥削的加强，以及对非资本家阶层收入的资本攻击来实现的。尽管国家将公开的萧条形态转变为“混合经济”典型的萧条变化形式，但国家不可避免地也必须继承经济萧条的传统功能。只有这样，才能再次增强作为“混合经济”功能基础的私人积累。因此，在经典萧条的过程中出现的资本重组过程必须由国家通过促进积累的目的来促进。 因此，凯恩斯主义方法总是伴随着剥削增强、资本集中、帝国主义等经典方法。这些不同的方法继续以私人资本的价值增长为其基础，并且反过来私人资本的价值增长受制于利润率的趋势性下降。这就产生了国家活动的双重性。一方面，由于国家支出扩大了消费范围超过资本生产的范围，因此是资本的否定。国家介入流通领域，实现生产的部分商品在市场机制之外。这样生产的物品不是商品，只是使用价值，但其成本对总资本的价值增长产生负面影响。这样的使用价值只有在总资本的积累不受这些使用价值的生产损害的情况下才能生产。但这种生产受制于资本价值增长的法则。因此，国家可以尝试在生产领域为私人资本改善价值增长条件。"},{"instruction":"请将“4 唯物論的国家理論の諸要素 I ブルジョア国家の一般的概念 今日のブルジョア社会科学は，国家理論的問題設定にまだほとんどかかわっていない。そのブルジョア的性格は，なによりもまず，それが現存の国家形態を自然形態であると宣言し，これによってその視座から閉め出してしまうというという点に示される。現代社会の歴史的発展諸法則から出発して一つの概念を展開することができないため，ブルジョア社会科学にとって「国家」は，偶発的な組織的装置，一つの空虚な容器と考えられ，そのため，その技術的機能様式やそれにたいする様々な政治的影響力を記述することだけしか問題とならないのである。国家形態それ自体は未展開のままであり，出現する政治過程の社会的連関は無視されるのである。この科学の階級的性格のゆえにたしかに必然的なことだが，歴史的発展の合法則性を反映する社会理論を放棄しているため，今日のブルジョア国家理論は，形式的な組織社会学ないしは一切の歴史的·社会的関連をはぎとられた抽象的なシステム理論へと堕落しているのであって，そのもっともきわ立った特徴は，歴史的認識の明白な放棄と，社会技術学的操作可能性ないしはイデオロギー的利用可能性への前述の指向性なのである。われわれはここではその俗流化と機能〔主義〕化の歴史にほかならないブルジョア国家理論の発展の記述を割愛し，また，この嘆かわしい状態のもとではイデオロギー批判としてしか行ないえないようなより最近の見解についての論議をも断念する。そのかわりにわれわれは唯物論的国家理論の諸基礎から出発するが，それらはマルクス， エンゲルスによって「ブルジョア社会の解剖学」の探求のさいに展開されたものであり，ブルジョア科学によっては，理解しうる理由から今日にいたるまで全面的に無視されているものである。そのさい前提とされていることは，「法的諸関係や国家諸形態はそれ自体からもいわゆる人間精神の普遍的発展からも理解されえず，逆に物質的生活諸関係の中にその基礎を有する」ということ，そしてこれらの物的生活諸関係は，まずもって生産諸様式として，つまり，諸国人がそのもとで生産をし相互に交易を行なう社会的諸条件として理解されるべきだということである。マルクスはこの点つぎのように述べている。「生産諸条件の所有者の直接生産者にたいする直接的関係-この関係のそのつどの形態は当然つねに労働の仕方の，したがってまた労働の社会的生産力に，一定の発展段階に対応している-，この関係こそは，つねにわれわれがそのうち社会構造全体の，したがってまた主権·従属関係の政治的形態の，要するにそのつどの独自な国家形態の，最奥の秘密，隠れた基礎を見いだすところのものである」。 ブルジョア社会は，分業と私的所有に基礎をおく私的生産と交換を通して構成される。その社会化の特殊形態は，相互に独立して行使される私的労働によって規定され，また，必然的に生産者の背後でかつ彼らの意識的な統制なしに樹立される社会的関連は，「交換価値において現われている。その交換価値において各個人にとっては，彼固有の活動または彼の生産物がはじめて各個人のための活動または生産物となる。（······）活動の社会的性格は，生産物の社会的形態，生産への個人の参与と同じく，ここでは個人に対立する無縁のもの，物的なものとして現われる。つまり，個人が相互に関係する行為としてではなく，個人に依存することなく存在し，たがいに無関心な個人の衝突から生じる（······）その相互的な関連は，彼ら自身には無縁で，独立に，一個の事物として現われる」。ブルジョア社会の貫徹にともなって私的生産者間の交換が展開すればするほど，交換価値が社会的連関を確立すればするほど， それだけはやく，社会の連関が人格的依存関係や直接的従属の諸形態を通して樹立される可能性と必要性は消滅してしまうのである。資本主義的生産様式の歴史的形成とともに，これらの形態（「封建主義」）は社会的発展の克服すべき障害として現われるのである。しかしながら諸個人は「自然生的共同態 〔Gemeinwesen］に包摂されてもいないし，また他方で，意識した共同社会性〔bewußt Gemeinschaftliche］として共同態を自身のもとに包摂しているわけでもないから，共同態は，独立の主体としての彼らに対立して，同様に一つの独立した，外的な偶然的な，物的なものとして，彼らに対立して，存在しなければならない。このことこそ，彼らが独立した私的個人として，同時に社会的関連のなかにあるということのための条件にほかならない。」彼らの労働の連関が諸個人にとって無縁な，一つのもの（貨幣）として現われるのと同様に，社会的普遍性は一つの特別の姿態をとらなければならない。貨幣に体現された交換価値が諸個人の意思から独立して生産の社会的統一性を生み出すのと同様に，個々の生産者の外部にある生産と再生産の普遍的諸条件を保障するためには，国家が必要とされる。諸個人および彼らの利害から切り離された社会的普遍性の国家における特殊化は，それゆえ，ブルジョア社会一般の歴史的前提であり条件である。「社会的活動のこの固定化，われわれの手におえずわれわれの期待を裏切りわれわれの計らいを水泡に帰せしめるわれわれ以上のなにか物的なカへの，われわれ自身の産物のこの凝固化は，従来の歴史的発展における主要契機の一つであって，そしてあたかも特殊な利益と共同の利益とのこの矛盾から共同の利益は国家として，現実的な個別的および総体的利益から切り離されている独立した一一姿態をとるようになるのである」。”翻译为中文","output":"# 4 唯物主义的国家理论的要素 I 资产阶级国家的一般概念 今天的资产阶级社会科学尚未真正涉及国家理论的问题。其资产阶级性质首先表现在，它宣称现存的国家形态是自然形态，并因此将其视角封闭。由于资产阶级社会科学无法从现代社会的历史发展规律出发来发展一个概念，因此对它来说，“国家”被视为一种偶然的组织装置，一个空虚的容器，因此只能对其技术功能方式和各种政治影响力进行描述。国家形态本身未得到进一步发展，出现的政治过程的社会联系被忽视。由于这种科学的阶级性质——这确实是必然的——它放弃了反映历史发展规律性的社会理论，因此今天的资产阶级国家理论已经沦落为形式化的组织社会学或者是剥离了一切历史·社会联系的抽象系统理论，其最显著的特征是历史认识的明显放弃，以及前述的社会技术操作性或意识形态利用可能性的倾向。在这里，我们将省略对资产阶级国家理论发展——即其俗化和功能化的历史——的描述，同样，我们也将放弃对最近一些在这种悲惨状况下只能作为意识形态批判进行的观点的讨论。相反，我们将从唯物主义国家理论的基础出发，这些基础由马克思、恩格斯在探索“资产阶级社会的解剖学”时发展出来，至今仍然被资产阶级科学因可理解的原因完全忽视。这里的前提是“法律关系和国家形态无法从它们自身或所谓人类精神的普遍发展来理解，而是必须从物质生活关系中找到其基础”，而这些物质生活关系首先应作为生产方式，即各国人民在其下进行生产和交换的社会条件来理解。马克思这样表述：“直接生产者对生产条件所有者的直接关系——这种关系的具体形式总是与劳动方式相对应，因此也对应于劳动的社会生产力在一定发展阶段上的情况——，这种关系恰恰总是我们在其中发现社会结构整体的，从而也是主权·从属关系的政治形态的，亦即各个特定国家形态的最深奥的秘密，隐藏的基础”。 资产阶级社会是基于分工和私有制的私人生产和通过交换构建的。其特殊形态的社会化由相互独立执行的私人劳动规定，并且，生产者背后以及在他们的有意识控制之外建立的社会联系，“以交换价值的形式呈现。在这个交换价值中，每个人的活动或产品首次成为每个人的活动或产品（......）。活动的社会性质以及作为个人参与生产的社会形式，在这里以与个人对立的、不依赖个人存在且互不关心的个人冲突中产生的、......这种互相联系，以一种与它们本身无关，独立于它们之外的事物的形式显现”。随着资产阶级社会的实现，私人生产者之间的交换越来越发展，交换价值越来越确立社会联系，个人之间通过人格依赖关系或直接从属的形式建立的社会联系的可能性和必要性就越快消失。随着资本主义生产方式的历史形成，这些形式（“封建主义”）作为社会发展中需克服的障碍出现。然而，因为个人既不是包含在自然的共同体中，也不是作为有意识的共同体将共同体纳入自己之中，所以共同体必须作为一个独立的实体对立于他们，同样作为一个独立的、外在的、偶然的、物质的事物对立于他们而存在。这恰恰是他们作为独立的私人个体同时处于社会联系中的条件。“这种社会活动的固定化，超出我们掌控并背离我们期望使我们的安排化为泡影的、物化的东西的凝固化，是历史发展中的主要驱动力之一，并且好像是特殊利益和共同利益之间的矛盾使得共同利益以国家的形式，现实的个别和总体利益分离的独立态态出现”。"},{"instruction":"请将“ブルジョア社会にたいして，国家は必然的に一つの特殊なもの，普遍的なものの矛盾した幻想的形態として振舞わなければならない。この意味において，国家は，「互いに自由で平等な私的所有者たち」の関係であり，「外部にたいする彼らの結合，（······）彼らの保証」なのであり，「ブルジョアジーが外にたいしても内にたいしても彼らの所有と彼らの利益の相互的保証のために必然的に自らに与える組織形態」なのである。「アンシュタルト」としての国家の特殊化（マクス·ウェーバー）ないしは（システム理論家たちがこの点に関しては適切に述べているように）「政治システムの分化」は，こうして商品生産社会の展開の歴史的論理にしたがって発展する。歴史的にはこの過程は，封建主義および絶対主義のパーソナルな支配構造と対立する近代的行政装置の形成，すなわち，行政手段の個人的所有からの行政官の分離，君主の具体的人格にたいする抽象的法人格としての国家装置の自立化，ブルジョア社会とそれから切り離されている国家装置の間の必然的な媒介項としての議会の成立として記述されるべきだろう。

そのさい中心的理論問題は，分業に基く商品生産社会の概念から導出された国家の規定（これは初期マルクスの諸労作にとって特徴的なのであるが）に立ち止まることにあるのではなく，具体的国家諸機構との関連におけるその固有の矛盾的性格を展開することにあるであろう。この矛盾的性格はつぎの点に存する。すなわち，単純商品生産は論理的かつ歴史的に資本主義的生産様式の前提を構成するが，後者の出現（本源的蓄積，自由な賃労働）は同時に商品生産の十全な展開と普遍化の条件であるという点にある。それゆえに，商品生産社会の展開された概念とともに，賃労働と資本の対立，搾取と剰余価値生産が同時に与えられるのである。等価交換は表層においてのみ生産と剰余価値の取得を媒介する。したがって，国家がこの社会構成体の再生産の共通の諸条件を保証する機能を有するブルジョア社会の共同性の特殊化として規定されるとするならば，この社会構成体の再生産過程は，資本主義的それとして，すなわち，剰余価値生産に依拠する拡大再生産過程，したがって蓄積過程として探究すべきなのである。商品生産社会の概念から導出されたブルジョア国家の一般的規定を超えて，その具体的機能諸規定は，それゆえに，資本主義的蓄積過程の歴史的に変化する諸条件から，この過程を通じてひきおこされる生産諸力の発展と，その過程とともに変化する社会化の諸形態から，導出されるべきなのである。問題なのは，蓄積過程とともに変化する経済的社会的基礎の諸合法則性と歴史的に具体的な形式の行方をさぐり出すことであり，それらは前述の一般的諸規定の中になるほど含まれているのであるが，けっして展開されてはいないのである。そのさい同時に考慮さるべきは-たとえ別の論理次元においてであろうとも-，「無数の経験的諸条件，自然諸条件，人種諸関係，外部から作用する歴史的影響」であり，これらは，同じ経済的基礎（そしてそれとともに国家の機能と形態）が，「現象において無限の変化を示すことができ，それらはただこれらの経験的に所与の諸条件の分析を通じてのみ把握されうる」ということの条件をなしているのである。蓄積過程としての資本主義的再生産過程の諸条件および諸法則性からの国家諸機能のこの種の導出は，ブルジョア左翼の国家諸理論とは明確な対立関係に立つものであって，後者はなるほど経済諸関係の基本的重要性を認めてはいるが，ブルジョア社会の解剖学を政治経済学には認めることができないのであり，そのため社会的運動法則の概念を発展させえないのである。 II ブルジョア社会と国家の関係の歴史的発展。「経済外的潜勢力」としての国家 国家理論は，これまでの叙述からいえば，ブルジョア社会の解剖学の一部分であり，したがってまず第一に国家装置の政治経済学である。すなわち，国家分析にとって基底的なのは，政治経済学批判の諸カテゴリーである。国家は根本的に，経済と並ぶないしはそれを越える「経済外的潜勢力」として規定されえず（このことは部分的に国独資理論において，そしていつでもブルジョア左翼的介入主義国家理論においておこっていることだが），それはその形態および機能規定において，社会的再生産過程とその合法則性から導出されねばならないのである。その「特殊化」は必然的にこの再生産過程の性格から生じ，その矛盾した姿態をそこから受け取っているのである。もちろん国家の歴史的具体的現象諸形態の分析にさいしては特別の困難がある。というのは，これまでとってきた諸規定においては，ブルジョア社会の構成と資本諸関係の十全の貫徹は論理的に前提されているのであって，それはそれぞれの歴史的現実にせいぜい近似的にしか照応していないからである。それゆえに，歴史的分析にさいしては，若干の補足的カテゴリーを導入し，一般的諸規定の部分修正を行なうことが必要となるのである。このことがとくに明瞭に現われるのは，歴史的発展局面の国家の探究にさいしてである。この局面では未発達の資本は社会的再生産の運動法則をまだ十分には規定していず，そして弱体なブルジョアジーは自己主張と自己貫徹のためになお非資本主義的諸階級および権力諸集団との同盟を必要としているのであって，そのさいそれらの対立（たとえば，絶対君主と諸身分，都市と農村との）を自分のために利用することを強いられるのである。ここではさしあたって「国家」は，事実，資本の再生産過程との関連においては「経済外的潜勢力」として現われる。なるほど封建的および絶対主義「国家」はけっして絶対的意味において「経済外的」なものとして把握されるべきではないが，しかしその経済的基礎は，一つの別の，歴史的により旧い生産様式なのである。このかぎりにおいて，そしてこのかぎりにおいてのみ，国家は資本に対する「経済外的潜勢力」なのである。伝統的支配装置はここではまだ未発達の資本のために，その諸前提（生産者の生産手段からの分離，商品流通および貨幣経済）を形成する支え，「歴史的解体過程の担い手，資本の実存の諸条件の形成者」として現われる。”翻译为中文","output":"# 4 唯物论的国家理论的要素 I 资产阶级国家的一般概念 面对资产阶级社会，国家必然作为一种特殊的存在，作为普遍性的矛盾而幻想的形式表现。在这个意义上，国家是“彼此自由平等的私有者之间的关系”，是“他们对外的联合，（......）他们的保障”，是“资产阶级不可避免地给予自己的组织形式为了双方的所有权和利益的互保，无论是对外还是对内”。以马克斯·韦伯的“国家”的特殊化（机构），或如系统理论家们在这一点上恰当地所说的“政治系统的分化”，因此按照商品生产社会发展的历史逻辑而发展。历史上，这一过程应描述为与封建主义和专制主义的个人统治结构相对抗的现代行政机构的形成，即行政手段从个人所有中的行政官的分离，国家机器作为抽象法人格超越君主的具体个性的独立，以及议会作为资产阶级社会与其分离的国家机器之间不可避免的中介机构的建立。 随着分工的商品生产者构成的社会历史发展，以形式化个人独立的制度为依托——尽管存在同时存在的物质依赖——但作为社会普遍性的幻象和矛盾的体现的国家的特殊化形成，我们在此发现了资产阶级国家的最一般性质规定。 核心理论问题不在于停留在从分工的商品生产社会的概念导出的国家的规定（这对早期马克思的工作来说是典型的），而在于展开与具体国家机构相关的其固有的矛盾性质。这种矛盾性存在于以下事实：简单商品生产逻辑上和历史上构成了资本主义生产方式的前提，而后者的出现（原始积累，自由雇佣劳动）同时也是商品生产的完全展开和普及的条件。因此，随着商品生产社会的发展概念，雇佣劳动与资本的对立，剥削与剩余价值生产同时被赋予。等价交换只是表面地中介生产和剩余价值的获取。因此，如果国家作为确保这一社会构成体再生产的共同条件的资产阶级社会的共同性特殊化，则这一社会构成体的再生产过程应作为资本主义再生产过程，即依赖剩余价值生产的扩大再生产过程，因而是积累过程进行探究。超越从商品生产社会概念导出的资产阶级国家的一般规定，其具体功能规定因此应该从资本主义积累过程的历史变迁条件、通过这一过程引发的生产力发展及其伴随的社会化形式的变化中导出。问题在于探究积累过程的经济社会基础的规律性和历史具体形式的走向，它们虽然包含在前述一般规定中，但绝未被展开。同时也应考虑—\\"即使是在不同的逻辑维度上—\\"“众多的经验条件，自然条件，种族关系，外部历史影响”，这些构成了即使在相同的经济基础（以及伴随的国家功能和形式）下，也能在现象中展示无限变化的条件，它们只能通过这些经验性给定条件的分析来把握。 将国家功能从资本主义再生产过程及其条件和规律性作为积累过程导出，这种导出与资产阶级左翼的国家理论形成明显对立，后者尽管承认经济关系的基本重要性，却无法在政治经济学中承认资产阶级社会的解剖学，因此无法发展社会运动规律的概念。 II 资产阶级社会与国家的历史发展。“经济以外潜力”作为国家 从迄今的叙述来看，国家理论是资产阶级社会解剖学的一部分，因而首先是国家装置的政治经济学。即，对国家分析而言，基础在于政治经济学批判的分类。国家本质上不能被定义为与经济相等或超越的“经济外潜力”（这在部分国家资本理论中，以及始终在资产阶级左翼的干预主义国家理论中发生），它的形式和功能规定必须从社会再生产过程及其规律性导出。其“特殊化”必然源于这一再生产过程的性质，并从中获得其矛盾形式。当然，在分析国家的历史具体现象形式时会遇到特殊困难，因为迄今所采取的规定逻辑上预设了资产阶级社会的构成和资本关系的完全贯彻，这些最多只能近似匹配各自的历史现实。因此，进行历史分析时，需要引入一些补充类别并对一般规定进行部分修正。这在国家的历史发展阶段的研究中尤为明显，此时未发达的资本还未能充分规定社会再生产的运动规律，脆弱的资产阶级仍然需要与非资本主义阶级和权力集团结盟以进行自我主张和贯彻，同时被迫利用这些对立关系（例如，君主与各阶层，城市与乡村之间的）为自己所用。在这种情况下，“国家”实际上作为与资本的再生产过程相关的“经济外潜力”出现。封建和专制主义的“国家”绝不应被绝对理解为“经济外”的东西，但其经济基础是一个历史上更古老的生产方式。在这种情况下，国家作为对资本的“经济外潜力”。传统统治装置在此为未发达的资本形成其前提（生产者与生产手段的分离，商品流通和货币经济），作为“历史解体过程的承担者，资本存在条件的形成者”出现。"},{"instruction":"cosidera il modello h(x) = 1 se 2x1+2x2+4x3>=0; 0 altrimenti. Se regolarizzato si avrebbero valori più bassi di 2 2 e 4 persenti nell'equazione?","output":"La regolarizzazione in machine learning è una tecnica usata per ridurre l'errore di generalizzazione e prevenire l'overfitting, modificando la funzione di costo per penalizzare pesi eccessivamente grandi. Le tecniche di regolarizzazione più comuni sono L1 (lasso) e L2 (ridge), dove L1 penalizza la somma assoluta dei pesi e L2 la somma dei quadrati dei pesi. Nel contesto del modello ( h(x) = 1 ) se ( 2x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 geq 0 ); ( 0 ) altrimenti, l'uso della regolarizzazione potrebbe effettivamente portare a valori più bassi dei coefficienti (pesi) ( 2, 2, ) e ( 4 ) presenti nell'equazione. Il grado in cui questi valori vengono ridotti dipenderà dai dettagli specifici dell'algoritmo di apprendimento, dal dataset utilizzato, dalla scelta del parametro di regolarizzazione e dal tipo di regolarizzazione applicata. Con la regolarizzazione L1, alcuni pesi possono diventare esattamente zero, portando a un modello più sparso, il che può essere utile per la selezione delle caratteristiche. Ciò significa che è possibile che alcuni dei coefficienti nell'equazione potrebbero essere ridotti a (0), eliminando effettivamente alcune variabili dal modello. Con la regolarizzazione L2, i pesi vengono generalmente solo ridotti, ma non diventano zero. Questo significa che tutti i coefficienti (2, 2, ) e (4) sarebbero probabilmente ridotti, ma rimarrebbero nel modello. In conclusione, sì, se applicata la regolarizzazione al modello ( h(x) ), i valori dei coefficienti (2, 2, ) e (4) sarebbero probabilmente ridotti rispetto ai loro valori originari, contribuendo a rendere il modello meno complesso e potenzialmente migliorando la sua capacità di generalizzazione su nuovi dati."},{"instruction":"Con la regolarizzazione L2, i pesi vengono generalmente solo ridotti, ma non diventano zero. Questo significa che tutti i coefficienti (2, 2, ) e (4) sarebbero probabilmente ridotti, ma rimarrebbero nel modello. c'è un modo per determinare quando verranno ridotti e quando no?","output":"La regolarizzazione L2, anche nota come regolarizzazione di Tikhonov o ridge regression nel contesto della regressione lineare, penalizza la somma dei quadrati dei pesi del modello. Questo approccio riduce la magnitudine dei pesi, ma, come hai giustamente notato, tipicamente non porta i pesi esattamente a zero. La penalizzazione è proporzionale al quadrato dei valori dei pesi, il che significa che i pesi più grandi vengono ridotti più significativamente. La quantità di riduzione dei pesi dipende da diversi fattori: 1. **Forza di Regolarizzazione (λ o alpha):** La regolarizzazione L2 aggiunge un termine di penalizzazione alla funzione di costo, che è proporzionale al quadrato dei pesi. La forza della regolarizzazione è controllata da un parametro, tipicamente denotato come λ (lambda) o alpha in alcune implementazioni. Un valore più elevato di λ implica una maggiore penalizzazione dei pesi, portando a una loro riduzione maggiore. Al contrario, un valore più basso di λ ha un impatto minore sui pesi. La scelta ottimale di λ di solito è trovata attraverso la validazione incrociata. 2. **Dati di Addestramento:** La regolarizzazione funziona in congiunzione con la minimizzazione dell'errore di addestramento. Quindi, l'entità della riduzione dei pesi dipende anche dalla natura dei dati di addestramento e dall'errore di addestramento. Se un peso è particolarmente rilevante per ridurre l'errore sui dati di addestramento, esso potrebbe essere ridotto meno rispetto a pesi che contribuiscono meno all'accuratezza del modello sugli stessi dati. 3. **Scelte di Progettazione del Modello:** La struttura generale del modello (ad esempio, numero di parametri, scegliere di utilizzare o meno feature polinomiali, ecc.) può anche influenzare l'esatto effetto della regolarizzazione sui pesi. Per determinare quanto esattamente i pesi verranno ridotti tramite regolarizzazione L2, quindi, non esiste una formula diretta applicabile a tutti i casi, poiché dipende fortemente dai dati specifici e dalla scelta dei parametri della regolarizzazione. Tuttavia, l'effetto della regolarizzazione può essere esaminato attraverso esperimenti empirici e validazione incrociata per selezionare il valore di λ che offre le migliori prestazioni di generalizzazione del modello. Infine, mentre la regolarizzazione L2 è ottima per affrontare il problema del sovradimensionamento dei pesi e dell'overfitting, la decisione su come regolarizzare e quanto pesantemente farlo deve essere guidata dalla comprensione sia teorica che empirica specifica al contesto dell'applicazione."},{"instruction":"Quello che voglio capire e se c'è un modo per capire quando i pesi non verranno ridotti dalla penalizzazione?","output":"Nel contesto della regolarizzazione L2, i pesi sono generalmente sempre influenzati dalla penalizzazione. Tuttavia, ci sono situazioni specifiche o condizioni sotto le quali la riduzione dei pesi potrebbe essere minima o quasi inesistente. Queste condizioni sono fortemente dipendenti dai seguenti fattori: 1. **Forza della penalizzazione (λ):** Se il parametro λ è impostato molto vicino a zero, l'impatto della regolarizzazione L2 sui pesi sarà minimo. In pratica, un λ molto basso significa che la penalizzazione ha poco effetto sulla funzione di costo totale, e quindi i pesi non saranno ridotti in maniera significativa. Tuttavia, tecnicamente, anche per valori molto piccoli di λ, c'è comunque una certa forma di penalizzazione, sebbene possa essere trascurabile. 2. **Rilevanza delle feature:** Nei casi in cui le feature sono estremamente rilevanti per la previsione, e quindi contribuiscono significativamente a ridurre l'errore di addestramento, la regolarizzazione L2 potrebbe avere un impatto minore sui pesi associati a tali feature. Ciò è dovuto al fatto che il contributo di questi pesi alla minimizzazione dell'errore di addestramento può essere sufficientemente alto da \\"bilanciare\\" la penalizzazione derivante dalla regolarizzazione. In altre parole, il modello \\"preferirebbe\\" mantenere questi pesi maggiori piuttosto che ridurli significativamente, perché ciò aumenterebbe l'errore di addestramento. 3. **Bilanciamento tra errore di addestramento e penalizzazione:** Nei casi in cui l'errore di addestramento sia ridotto ottimizzando i pesi finché il beneficio in termini di riduzione dell'errore di addestramento ottenuto riducendo ulteriormente un peso è bilanciato esattamente dalla penalizzazione aggiunta dalla regolarizzazione L2, i pesi potrebbero non essere ridotti ulteriormente. Questo equilibrio è altamente specifico per il dataset e la configurazione del modello. 4. **Feature Normalizzazione:** Inoltre, la normalizzazione delle feature prima dell'applicazione della regolarizzazione può influenzare la riduzione dei pesi. Se tutte le feature sono normalizzate, la regolarizzazione ha un impatto uniforme sui pesi. Tuttavia, senza normalizzazione, le feature con varianza elevata potrebbero influenzare il processo di addestramento in modo che la regolarizzazione non riduca significativamente i loro pesi. In sintesi, mentre la regolarizzazione L2 è progettata per influenzare tutti i pesi, l'entità di tale influenza può variare notevolmente in base alla scelta dei parametri di regolarizzazione, alla rilevanza delle feature, e al bilanciamento tra la minimizzazione dell'errore di addestramento e la penalizzazione dei pesi. Tuttavia, è importante sottolineare che, per definizione, la regolarizzazione L2 ha lo scopo di ridurre i pesi, quindi è raro trovarsi in una situazione in cui i pesi non vengono affatto ridotti, a meno che la forza della regolarizzazione non sia impostata su un valore estremamente basso."},{"instruction":"Quindi quando regolarizzo avrò sempre pesi ridotti?","output":"Sì, nel contesto della regolarizzazione L2 (e similmente con L1), l'intento fondamentale è di penalizzare i pesi di grandi dimensioni come parte del processo di ottimizzazione. Ciò si traduce nella tendenza generale verso pesi più piccoli nel modello regolarizzato rispetto al modello non regolarizzato. La regolarizzazione è impiegata specificamente per mantenere i pesi a un livello moderato, riducendo il rischio di overfitting e promuovendo la capacità del modello di generalizzare bene a dati non visti durante l'addestramento. La regolarizzazione L1 può effettivamente portare alcuni pesi a diventare esattamente zero, favorendo così la selezione delle caratteristiche. La regolarizzazione L2, d'altra parte, tende a ridurre il valore dei pesi, ma non necessariamente a zero — si ritiene che ciò conduca a modelli con una distribuzione più \\"liscia\\" o uniforme dei pesi, il che può contribuire a migliorarne la generalizzazione. Per quanto riguarda i pesi, quando applichi la regolarizzazione (sia L1 che L2), in teoria e nella pratica, avrai quasi sempre dei pesi che sono ridotti rispetto a quello che sarebbero stati in un modello non regolarizzato. Questo effetto è più pronunciato per i pesi che altrimenti sarebbero grandi, poiché la penalizzazione quadratica di L2 incide in maniera più significativa su di essi. Tuttavia, il grado specifico in cui i pesi sono ridotti dipende dal valore del parametro di regolarizzazione λ. Con un λ molto piccolo, l'effetto della regolarizzazione può essere minimale, rendendo la riduzione dei pesi appena percettibile. Con un λ più grande, l'effetto della regolarizzazione sarà più evidente, risultando in una riduzione significativa dei pesi. In sintesi, sì, quando applichi la regolarizzazione, dovresti aspettarti di vedere una riduzione nei pesi del modello come risultato diretto del processo di ottimizzazione che ora include la penalità di regolarizzazione."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const t=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return t?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(t)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(t)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],L={key:0},N={key:1};function q(t,e,l,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return i(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",D,[(i(!0),n(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(i(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),n("div",j,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
