Activists say design is too similar to the traditional Samoan Pe'a male tattoo. They find it exploitative and 750 people who signed online petition agree. Described as a 'direct violation of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific'","output":"Nike's latest workout gear has stirred up controversy in Australia and New Zealand for its design that bears a striking resemblance to the traditional Samoan Pe'a male tattoo. Activists argue that the design is exploitative and a direct violation of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific. Over 750 people have signed an online petition, agreeing with the activists that the design is inappropriate and insensitive. The Samoan Pe'a tattoo is sacred and holds deep cultural significance for the Samoan people. The intricate and pain-staking process of getting the tattoo is a rite of passage for Samoan men. The design on Nike's workout gear is seen as an appropriation of Samoan culture, which disregards the cultural significance of the Pe'a tattoo. It is not the first time that a fashion or design company has been accused of appropriating indigenous culture, and Nike should have been more cautious and respectful with their design choices. The controversy serves as a reminder of the importance of cultural sensitivity and respect. Companies must conduct thorough research into the cultural significance of designs and consult with members of the impacted communities before making them public. Failure to do so sends a message that cultural appropriation is acceptable, and this can cause significant harm to already marginalized groups. In conclusion, Nike must take responsibility for its design choices and work towards becoming more culturally sensitive and respectful. It is crucial for companies to understand and respect cultural differences, rather than exploit them for profit. By doing so, they can promote cultural understanding and meaningful relationships, while avoiding the distressing backlash like the one experienced by Nike."},{"instruction":"Generate a negative review for a place.","output":"The customer service at this place was extremely disappointing.

During World War I, Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, all nonRussian countries declared their independence from the Russian empire, leading to the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia.

Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.

The rider stands on a wakeboard, which is similar to a snowboard in shape, and carves through the water while performing tricks and jumps. So, how do you go about wakeboarding? It's simple – just put pressure on your feet to move the board around. Lean into the edges to turn, and turn out of the wake for smoother skating. It's important to use the edge of the wake like a ramp to get some air for performing tricks. Once you have mastered the basics, it's time to try out some skateboarding tricks like the ollie. An ollie is a simple jump in the water where the rider jumps off the board and then lands back on it. To perform an ollie, start by crouching down on the board and then quickly jump up. Use your back foot to kick the board up, and then use your front foot to level it out before landing back on it. Once you have mastered the ollie, try out some more advanced tricks like the 360 or the kickflip. The 360 involves spinning the board around 360 degrees while in the air. The kickflip involves flipping the board over while in the air and then landing back on it. Wakeboarding is an excellent water sport for those who love the adrenaline rush of skateboarding and snowboarding.

Fake reviews often don't contain facts or matches that are normal topics of discussion. Start by watching out for fake reviewswhether they come to you online or by emailing. When someone complains that a product you buy suddenly goes bad, that person probably is not even buying itthat's no doubt a scam. Similarly, a genuine fake can use almost anything in the store instead of simply the packaging. Fake reviews come for simple reasons, e.g. If a review reads like something that would be written on the back of the box, steer clear of it. This can include buzzwords like oneofakind, unique, awardwinning, or revolutionary.","output":"Additionally, look for reviews that provide specific details about the product and the user's experience with it, rather than general statements that could apply to any product."},{"instruction":"Roland Martin says he has long been opposed to hazing. The death of a university band member has raised the topic again, he notes. A zero tolerance policy on hazing is needed now, Martin says. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The tragic death of a university band member has once again put the spotlight on the issue of hazing. Roland Martin, a prominent figure in the fight against hazing, has long been vocal about its dangers and negative impacts. He argues that it's time for a zero tolerance policy on hazing. Hazing has been a controversial issue for years, especially in fraternities and sororities, where new members are often subjected to dangerous and humiliating rituals. Despite efforts to combat it, hazing continues to claim lives and leave lasting psychological scars. The recent case of a university band member who died after an alleged hazing incident has once again ignited calls for action. Roland Martin, who has been a vocal opponent of hazing for years, says that a zero tolerance policy is essential to stamp out this dangerous practice. In his view, there can be no excuses or justifications for hazing. Those who engage in it must be held accountable, and universities must take a strong stand against it. Martin emphasizes that hazing is not a harmless tradition, but a serious problem that can have devastating consequences. It's time for universities and organizations to take a hard look at their hazing policies and take meaningful steps to prevent it. This means enforcing strict rules and severe penalties, including expulsion or criminal charges, for those who participate in hazing. In conclusion, the death of a university band member has once again highlighted the dangers of hazing, and it's time for action. Roland Martin's call for a zero tolerance policy on hazing is necessary and overdue. Only by taking a strong stand against hazing can we protect our students and ensure a safe and healthy college experience."},{"instruction":"The 2017 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell (also known as the Torneo Godó) was a men's tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts.

This covers the use of combining diacritical marks. They are inserted after the main character. Multiple combining diacritics may be stacked over the same character. Unicode also contains precomposed versions of most letter/diacritic combinations in normal use. These make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler, and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal text format without having to implement combining characters. For example, é can be represented in Unicode as U+0065 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E) followed by U+0301 (COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT), but it can also be represented as the precomposed character U+00E9 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE).

One of the most important steps is to water the bamboo on a regular basis, as it is a thirsty plant that needs a lot of moisture. Additionally, spreading mulch around the bamboo can help keep the soil moist and protect it from harsh heat or cold. During the winter, it's important to protect the bamboo from freezing temperatures, so consider covering it with blankets or burlap to keep it warm. When it comes to fertilizing bamboo, use a high-nitrogen fertilizer to help it grow faster and stronger. But be careful not to use too much fertilizer, as this can damage the bamboo's delicate root system. As bamboo grows, it may need to be thinned and pruned to prevent it from becoming too dense or overcrowded. Disinfect pruning tools before use to avoid spreading disease. Additionally, be sure to protect bamboo against pests and diseases, as it can be susceptible to various insects and fungi. Finally, consider harvesting your bamboo if it becomes too large or if you want to use it for crafts or building materials.

In the popular game Minecraft, one of the first steps in crafting is turning trees into wood. To do this, simply find a tree and hit it with your hand or any tool. Once the tree has been harvested, you will receive a block of wood. This can be used as a building material or further crafted into planks. Crafting tables are an essential tool in Minecraft, as they allow players to access the full range of crafting recipes. To create a crafting table, collect four blocks of wooden planks and arrange them in a square shape in your inventory crafting grid. Now that you have a crafting table, it's time to create your first weapon: a wooden sword. To create a wooden sword, simply arrange two blocks of wooden planks and one block of stick on your crafting table. The wooden sword is a basic weapon, but it can be a crucial tool in early game combat. Once you have your wooden sword, it's time to put it to use. Use your sword to defend yourself against hostile mobs or to harvest resources from animals such as chickens, pigs, and cows. In summary, crafting in Minecraft is a fun and rewarding experience. Turning trees into wood, creating a crafting table, and making a wooden sword are just a few of the first steps in mastering the crafting system.

He was jailed in notorious Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipa, Mexico. He endured death threats, extortion attempts and deteriorating health. Was honourably discharged from Marines with posttraumatic stress.","output":"John Hammar: From Legal Gun Owner to a Prison in Mexico John Hammar, a 27-year-old former Marine, experienced a nightmare when he was detained for declaring his legal shotgun to border guards. He spent four months in the notorious Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipas, Mexico, enduring death threats, extortion attempts, and deteriorating health. Hammar was visiting Mexico on his way to Costa Rica for a surfing trip with a friend. His shotgun, which he planned to use for hunting and personal protection, was a legal possession in the United States. However, Mexican laws prohibit civilians from carrying guns, and Hammar declared his shotgun as per the United States laws, which resulted in his detention. Hammar's imprisonment was nothing short of a nightmare. He shared a cell with cartel members and was under constant threat of violence. He was chained to his bed for a significant portion of his stay and lost 40 pounds due to the prison's terrible conditions. To make matters worse, Hammar was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition he developed after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the U.S. Consulate worked tirelessly to get him released, it took four months of daily visits, phone calls, and a massive public campaign to get Hammar back to the United States. He finally returned home in December 2012 and was honorably discharged from the Marines the following year. Hammar's harrowing experience highlights the need for travelers to educate themselves on foreign gun laws. What may be a legal possession in the United States may not be the case in another country. It also shines a light on the challenges veterans with PTSD and other mental health conditions face when traveling abroad. In conclusion, John Hammar's detainment in a Mexican prison is a stark reminder of the importance of being aware of foreign laws and regulations. His story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the unwavering dedication of those who fought for his release."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: and for those who have had mystical experience of the divine presence behind the mind, of divine wisdom behind the cosmos, it is the only acceptable doctrine.","output":"And for those who have had mystical experience of the divine presence behind the mind, of divine wisdom behind the cosmos, it is the only acceptable doctrine."},{"instruction":"Question: Who took over after ESPN?

By blowing up a balloon and rubbing it against the hair on top of your head, you can create a static charge that will cause the balloon to stick to the wall or ceiling. This fun little experiment is a great way to introduce children to the concept of static electricity and can also be a fun party trick to share with friends. All you need is a little bit of patience and a willingness to try something new. To begin, blow up a balloon to its full size and tie it off securely. Then, rub the balloon against the hair on top of your head. The friction between the balloon and your hair will cause electrons to move from your hair to the balloon, which creates a static charge. Once you've created a static charge, hold the balloon near a wall or ceiling and watch as it sticks in place. This happens because the static charge on the balloon temporarily neutralizes the charge of the surface it's touching, allowing it to \\"stick\\" via the electrostatic force. This simple experiment is a great way to learn about the basics of electricity and can be a fun interactive experience for kids and adults alike.

This move caused a delay in the start of the 2012-2013 season, and fans were left feeling frustrated and cheated. After months of negotiations, a tentative agreement was reached last weekend between the NHL owners and the players' union. The deal was finalized on Saturday and included a 48-game regular season. The lockout of NHL players lasted for 113 days, marking the third lockout in the league's history since 1994. Discussions between the two parties were tense and often seemed deadlocked. However, both sides eventually came to an agreement that satisfied the interests of both parties. The new labor deal outlines a shorter-term income split and player contracts. Among the negotiations included in the deal were a new revenue-sharing plan that will see the players receive 50% of the league's revenue. Despite the shortened season, players are expected to hit the ice with renewed vigor and excitement. Rivalries are sure to revive, and the race for the playoffs will be more intense than ever. The NHL's shortened season may prove to be a positive aspect for both the players and the fans. The 48-game season will run from January through April, setting the stage for an exciting and fast-paced season.

The simplest are unjointed and form paired bundles near the top and bottom of each side of each segment. The parapodia (limbs) of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips – for example jointed, comblike or hooked. Chetae are made of moderately flexible βchitin and are formed by follicles, each of which has a chetoblast (hairforming) cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta. The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming microvilli, fine hairlike extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta. When the cheta is complete, the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta. Hence annelids' chetae are structurally different from the setae (bristles) of arthropods, which are made of the more rigid αchitin, have a single internal cavity, and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle.

Physicians have years of specialized training and experience, and can help identify underlying health issues that may be causing your symptoms. They can also provide expert advice and guidance on how to care for yourself, prevent illness, and manage chronic conditions. When you make an appointment, your physician may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and perform a physical examination. They may also order lab tests or imaging studies to help diagnose your condition. Based on the results of these tests, they will work with you to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs. Remember that early diagnosis and treatment are critical for some conditions, so don’t hesitate to see a physician if you suspect something may be wrong. It’s always better to be on the safe side and get checked out by a professional, even if it turns out to be nothing serious.

Max Weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization, which he believed would trap individuals in an iron cage of rational thought. Some sociologists, including Georg Simmel and W. E. B. Du Bois, utilized more microsociological, qualitative analyses.

It is also worth noting that the study was conducted on social media, where swearing may be more prevalent than in other forms of communication. The anonymity of the internet allows people to express their emotions more freely, including the use of curse words.

However, it's important to remember that our parents have always been there for us, and we should continue to show them love and respect throughout our lives. One of the best ways to show your parents love and respect is to simply not ignore them. Even if you're busy with school, work, or your social life, take the time to check in with your parents regularly. This can be as simple as sending them a quick text message or giving them a call to see how their day is going. By staying in touch, you'll let them know that they're still an important part of your life. It's also important not to be rude to your parents. This includes things like being dismissive when they try to talk to you, rolling your eyes when they ask you to do something, or talking back when they give you feedback. Remember that your parents are trying to help you and guide you through life, and they're doing the best they can with the knowledge and experience they have. Even if you disagree with them, it's important to be respectful and polite. When you do talk to your parents, try to stay positive. Avoid complaining or venting about your problems unless you really need their help or advice. Instead, focus on the good things in your life and share your successes and accomplishments with them. This will help them feel proud of you and excited about your future. If you have a girlfriend, don't be afraid to talk about her with your parents. Share stories about things you've done together and ask your parents for their advice or opinions. Even if they don't always understand your relationship or your girlfriend's personality, they'll appreciate that you're keeping them in the loop and including them in your life. Finally, make an effort to ask your parents questions about their lives and experiences. This can help you learn more about them as individuals and deepen your relationship with them. Plus, it shows them that you care about what they have to say and value their perspective. In summary, it's important to remember to show love and respect to our parents as we grow older. By staying in touch, being polite, staying positive, talking about our relationships, and asking questions, we can strengthen the bond we share with our parents and show them how much we appreciate their guidance and support."},{"instruction":"Does They purged monarchists and members of Idris' Senussi clan from Libya's political world and armed forces; Gaddafi believed this elite were opposed to the will of the Libyan people and had to be expunged. correctly answer the question of What happened to Idris?

However, their journey was cut short when the balloons burst, and the winds and storms rolled in. Despite this, both men were \\"rattled\\" but unharmed. The concept of a \\"lawn chair balloon flight\\" gained popularity in the 1980s. Typically, the balloons are filled with helium, and the chair is tethered with a few ropes to the ground. However, these two flyers decided to take things a step further by launching themselves into the sky. According to reports, the flyers reached a height of around 15,000 feet before things took a turn for the worse. The balloons burst, and the men were propelled downwards, causing their lawn chairs to spin uncontrollably. The flyers were fortunate to land safely, albeit far from their intended destination. While lawn chair balloon flights can be exciting and adventurous, they are not without risks. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that flying a lawn chair balloon is the equivalent of flying an aircraft, and licensing is required. Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions, such as the wind and storms that caused the end of this particular flight, can put lives in danger. In conclusion, while it may seem like a fun adventure, a lawn chair balloon flight can be dangerous without proper planning and precautions. Despite the unfortunate result, the two flyers were lucky to have emerged unharmed. It is essential to take into account all the necessary safety protocols and guidelines before undertaking any such extreme adventure."},{"instruction":"This is some data: United States, ethnicGroup, Asian Americans; A Severed Wasp, country, United States.

This rise in wolf activity has been attributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall by scientists.

Adding to the wolf resurgence in Europe is the recent discovery of a dead wolf on a Dutch road, marking the country's first sighting of a wolf in 150 years.

Wolves have a long history of coexisting with humans in Europe, but conflicts between them have also been well-documented. In Germany, for example, farmers have experienced losses due to wolf-pack raids, and residents have expressed concerns about safety in areas where wolves have been spotted. Despite this, conservation efforts and government regulations have been put in place to help manage the growing wolf population. As the resurgence of wolves in Europe continues, it is important for both conservationists and locals to work together towards sustainable solutions that balance the interests of all parties involved.

At each different temperature, the curve is moved over by Wien's displacement law (1893). Wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object, which was correct at high frequencies (short wavelength) but not at low frequencies (long wavelength).

According to medical experts, there is no chance of survival for someone who has met the criteria for brain death. In other words, there has never been a case where someone has recovered from brain death. This is because the brain is responsible for controlling all bodily functions, and without it, there is no possibility of life.

A household is defined as a group of people who live together, usually sharing living expenses and domestic tasks. This means that there can be multiple people in a single household, but the number of households will always be fewer than the total number of people.

The census data indicates that there were approximately 127 million households in the United States and its territories in 2020, which is about 4 million less than the total population of 331 million people.

During his career, he attempted a total of 424 field goals and successfully made 350 of them, giving him a career field goal percentage of 82.5%. Unfortunately, simply knowing Mare's career field goal percentage does not provide an answer to the question of how many yards he kicked. This is because field goals can be attempted from varying distances on the field, with different yardage values assigned based on where the line of scrimmage is located. To answer the question of how many yards Olindo Mare kicked, we need to look at his individual field goal attempts and determine the yardage of each kick. According to statistics from Pro Football Reference, Mare kicked 424 field goals during his NFL career, with an average distance of 36.3 yards per attempt. While Mare did attempt field goals from longer distances, including several from beyond 50 yards, the majority of his successful kicks were from closer range. In fact, roughly two-thirds of Mare's made field goals (233 out of 350) were from 39 yards or less, with the most common distance being 36 yards. Overall, while Olindo Mare had a successful career as an NFL kicker with a high percentage of made field goals, his success was largely due to his accuracy from closer range. While he did attempt and make several longer field goals, the majority of his successful attempts were from distances of 39 yards or less."},{"instruction":"Article: In America, Episcopalian Dennis Bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement's seminal influence.

The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant.

Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph. Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources.

This news comes as a surprise to many as Blatter had previously pledged not to stand again in 2011. However, it seems that he has changed his mind and is eager to continue on as the leader of the international football organization. Blatter has been at the helm of FIFA since 1998 and has been re-elected four times already. Over the years, he has faced numerous allegations of corruption and misconduct, but has managed to hold on to his position despite the scandals that have plagued the organization. Blatter's decision to seek another term has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised his leadership and believe that he has done a lot to promote football around the world. Others, however, have criticized his tenure and believe that he has not done enough to address the corruption scandals that have tainted FIFA's reputation. Blatter's announcement comes just days before the start of the World Cup in Brazil, which is sure to be one of the biggest sporting events of the year. The tournament is set to showcase some of the best football talent in the world and is expected to draw millions of viewers from all over the globe. While the World Cup may distract many from the news of Blatter's reelection bid, it is important to remember that the fate of football's governing body lies in the hands of its leaders. Whether or not Blatter is the right person to lead FIFA is a question that only time will answer. However, it is clear that his decision to seek another term will be met with both support and criticism."},{"instruction":"She saw more than he 'd ever realized , and had a greater understandng of his purpose than most .

He was a renowned military leader who conquered many regions, including parts of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. One question that often arises when discussing Bayinnaung's military campaigns is whether he had more horses or elephants in his army. There is no definitive answer to this question, as historical records from the time are limited and often inconsistent. However, we can make some educated guesses based on accounts from the period and the military tactics of the time. Firstly, it is important to note that both horses and elephants were important components of Bayinnaung's army. Horses were used primarily for cavalry charges and fast-moving pursuits, while elephants were used as heavy infantry, capable of breaking through enemy lines and creating havoc on the battlefield. However, it seems likely that Bayinnaung had more elephants than horses in his army. This is because elephants were more highly valued and more difficult to obtain than horses, particularly in the regions that Bayinnaung conquered. Elephants had been used in warfare in Southeast Asia for centuries, and the kings and nobles who controlled them had a significant military advantage. Moreover, Bayinnaung was known to have captured many elephants during his conquests, both for their military value and for their prestige. He reportedly had a large elephant stable in his capital city, Prome, and was said to have ridden on a white elephant during his coronation. That being said, it is likely that Bayinnaung also had a significant number of horses in his army. Horses were still highly prized by military leaders for their speed and mobility, and Bayinnaung would have recognized their value. In conclusion, while we cannot say for certain how many horses or elephants Bayinnaung had in his army, it seems likely that he had more elephants than horses. However, both were important components of his military strategy, and he would have made use of both to achieve his conquests."},{"instruction":"ere is a goal: Make turmeric milk Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?

Next, you should also make sure to grease the mechanisms that allow the chair to swivel and adjust in height.

This will allow you to see how the chair moves under weight and make sure that everything is running smoothly.

This can often be done by removing the back panel and tightening the springs or replacing them if they are damaged. Finally, make sure to roll the chair back and forth to check out the wheels. If they are not rolling smoothly or are wobbly, you may need to replace them or tighten any bolts that are causing the issue.

Baltica formed roughly the northwestern half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused the Variscan orogeny in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, forming the hills of Munster, southwest England, and southern Wales. Over the last 500 million years the land that forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30°S, crossing the equator around 370 million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.

A relatively recent FET development, the highelectronmobility transistor (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAsmetal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz.

Stay Busy Summer provides a perfect opportunity to engage in many activities that are not necessarily academic-related, including sports, outdoor activities, community or volunteer work, learning new skills and travelling. Finding, planning and executing such activities will not only help you develop your interests, talents and skills, but also gives you a sense of progress and accomplishment. 2. Continue Studying While it may sound daunting, continuing to study during the summer can actually be incredibly helpful in the long run. Reviewing past materials, practicing and seeking to learn new courses before the upcoming academic year begins will enable you to learn from any mistakes made in the past and perform better in the future. 3. Spend Time with Friends Attending the Same School Summer is also a great chance to connect with and spend time with friends who will be attending the same school as you.

In the Winter War of 1939-1940, the Karelian regiment was a unit of the Soviet Red Army and was one of the most effective fighting forces on the Soviet side. The regiment was made up of soldiers from the Karelia region of Russia, which borders Finland. Their primary objective was to invade and occupy Finnish territory. The first major engagement for the Karelian regiment was at Jyskyjärvi, which took place on December 2, 1939. The Finnish troops had established defensive positions around a frozen lake, and the Karelian regiment was ordered to attack. Despite heavy Finnish resistance, the Karelian regiment was able to break through the defensive line and push the Finnish troops back. After their success at Jyskyjärvi, the Karelian regiment moved on to Luusalmi, where another Finnish defensive line had been established. This battle took place on December 7, 1939. The Karelian regiment once again faced heavy resistance, but they were able to find a weak spot in the Finnish defensive line and exploit it. This enabled them to push through and regain control of the area. In many ways, the Karelian regiment was emblematic of the Soviet Red Army during the Winter War.

The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or more closely related to the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or twopart naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.

Some sources suggest that the Waldenses joined Protestant churches in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands in the 16th century. Others state that they also joined churches in England and Scotland during this time. However, it is important to note that the Waldenses did not completely abandon their own unique beliefs and practices. They continued to uphold certain traditions, such as their emphasis on poverty and simplicity, and their rejection of the authority of the Pope. Despite facing persecution and expulsion from Catholic countries, the Waldenses were able to find refuge in Protestant territories where they were often welcomed and allowed to practice their faith freely.

According to a recent study, 60 percent of small businesses do not have confidence that they can find a young person who is ready to work. Youth unemployment has become a significant issue in recent years, as more and more young people struggle to find work after leaving school. One reason for this trend is that many young people are unprepared for the workforce, lacking the necessary skills and experience to succeed. Despite the criticism, Hurd's comments highlight the need for a shift in how we approach youth employment. Instead of simply expecting young people to enter the workforce with little more than a good attitude, we need to invest in their future by providing them with the right resources and training. This will not only benefit young people, but also businesses struggling to find the right fit for their organization.

One of the keys to this type of look is using foundation and concealer minimally, as too much can make the skin appear unnatural and overly made up. Instead, focus on creating a flawless base with light coverage products that match your skin tone. Another important element of a gender-neutral makeup look is bold eyebrows, which help to frame the face and provide a strong focal point. Use a brow pencil or powder to define and fill in any sparse areas, being careful not to overdo it and to maintain a natural appearance. When it comes to eye makeup, neutral shades of eyeshadow are the way to go. These colors can create depth and dimension without appearing too glamorous or feminine. Adding eyeliner can help to define the eyes and make them stand out, while still maintaining a gender-neutral appearance. For lips, shiny lip glosses in neutral shades are a great choice. These add a subtle touch of glamour while avoiding the appearance of bold colors or overly feminine shades. Finally, it's important to play up your masculine or feminine features depending on your facial structure. If you have traditionally feminine features, such as large eyes or full lips, consider embracing these with your makeup choices. Conversely, those with traditionally masculine features, such as a strong jawline or angular features, can enhance these with more subtle, gender-neutral makeup choices. By following these tips, anyone can achieve a balanced and natural gender-neutral makeup look that enhances their features and creates a striking appearance."},{"instruction":"Write the answer: On the Mohs scale of hardness, what is the second hardest mineral, after diamond?","output":"The second hardest mineral on the Mohs scale is corundum."},{"instruction":"August 2011 Lee was selected as a member of the South Korean U 18 national team for the Asian Junior Baseball Championship held in Yokohama , Japan .

Conversely, the mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure by weight, unless the energy loss is very large.

Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. However there's hope ... I've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better. So in conclusion I must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.

Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spineproducing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: treelike diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.
