Parliament passed a new act in 1772 that reduced this refund, effectively leaving a 10% duty on tea imported into Britain. The act also restored the tea taxes within Britain that had been repealed in 1767, and left in place the three pence Townshend duty in the colonies. With this new tax burden driving up the price of British tea, sales plummeted. The company continued to import tea into Great Britain, however, amassing a huge surplus of product that no one would buy. For these and other reasons, by late 1772 the East India Company, one of Britain's most important commercial institutions, was in a serious financial crisis. The severe famine in Bengal from 1769 to 1773 had drastically reduced the revenue of the East India Company from India bringing the Company to the verge of bankruptcy and the Tea Act of 1773 was enacted to help the East India Company. Is this statement correct did the tea act increase the price of tea? OPTIONS: no ye","output":"The statement is not completely accurate. While the Tea Act of 1773 did not directly increase the price of tea in the colonies, it did effectively maintain the tax on tea, making it more expensive than smuggled tea."},{"instruction":"by creating donor embryos from fresh donor egg and frozen thawed sperm from our sperm donors fertilisation always takes place through the natural method (by just mixing the eggs and sperm) which allows natural selection as to which sperm will fertilise the egg, provides maximal embryo quality and success rates.

This can help ensure that decisions are consistent with the law and with precedent, and that judges and other officials receive ongoing training and support. It can also help ensure that the court is not unduly influenced by local politics or biases. - Regional courts can be more accessible and convenient for people who live in more rural or remote areas, as they may not have to travel as far to attend court hearings or access court services. This can be especially important for people who are low-income, elderly, or have mobility issues. - Finally, regional courts can help build trust and confidence in the justice system among the public.

In the most general case, polarization is elliptical, meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time. Two special cases are linear polarization (the ellipse collapses into a line) as we have discussed above, and circular polarization (in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal). In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation. Circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as righthanded or lefthanded using the thumb in the direction of the propagation rule. Note that for circular polarization, optical researchers use the opposite right hand rule from the one used by radio engineers.

The cavalry was divided into different types, including dragoons and Cossacks, as well as Tatars and Kalmyks. But which of these were the most prevalent in battle? When it comes to raw numbers, infantry constituted the bulk of most armies. Infantry units were made up of foot soldiers armed with muskets and bayonets. The size of an infantry unit could vary greatly, from a small platoon of 20 or 30 men to a regiment of several thousand soldiers. During the same time period, dragoons were typically a smaller, more specialized unit of cavalry, trained to fight both on horseback and on foot. Cossacks, Tatars, and Kalmyks, on the other hand, were all groups from the Caucasus region of Russia that were known for their horsemanship and fighting skills. So, which of these groups had the most soldiers? It's difficult to say for certain, as the numbers varied greatly depending on the time and place of battle. However, it's safe to say that infantry soldiers made up the majority of most armies during this time. Cavalry units, including dragoons, Cossacks, Tatars, and Kalmyks, were typically smaller in number but could provide an essential role in flanking or surprising enemy forces during battle. Despite their smaller numbers, Cossacks, Tatars, and Kalmyks were known for their mobility, which made them valuable for scouting and quick attacks. Their skills as horsemen also made them well-suited for the type of hit-and-run tactics that were common in this era of warfare. In conclusion, while infantry units made up the bulk of most armies during the 18th and 19th centuries, cavalry units like dragoons, Cossacks, Tatars, and Kalmyks played a vital role in battles. Their mobility and unique fighting skills made them an asset in a wide range of military situations, even if they weren't always the largest force on the battlefield."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...when was devil in the white city written??","output":"Devil in the White City was written in 2003."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Browns Cambridge, eatType = coffee shop, food = Japanese, customer rating = average, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes, near = Crowne Plaza Hotel.

Here are some simple steps to follow when growing jasmine: 1. Choose a cultivar to grow The first step to growing jasmine is selecting the right cultivar for your needs. Some of the most popular options include Arabian jasmine, yellow jasmine, and primrose jasmine, each with their own unique characteristics and growing requirements. Be sure to research each option thoroughly before making your decision. 2. Find a suitable spot for your jasmine plant Jasmine requires a warm and sunny location with good drainage. Consider planting your jasmine near a south-facing wall or in a spot that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. 3. Prepare the soil for planting Jasmine prefers a well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. Mix in compost or manure to the planting area to help improve the soil's fertility and structure. Avoid planting in heavy clay soils or areas that are prone to standing water. 4. Plant the jasmine Once you've selected your cultivar, found a suitable spot, and prepared the soil, it's time to plant your jasmine. Dig a hole that is slightly larger than the root ball, and gently place the plant in the hole, ensuring that the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil.

One of the key components of this type of project is choosing the right materials to work with, and two of the most important are the fabric and the frame. One of the most common mistakes that people make when creating their own wall art is selecting a fabric and frame that clash with one another. This can detract from the beauty and overall aesthetic of the piece, making it feel disjointed and distracting to the eye. Rather than relying on trial and error, it is best to take a more intentional approach when selecting your materials. To ensure that your fabric and frame complement each other, start by selecting a fabric that you love, and then using it as a guide to choose a frame that will make it pop. For example, if you have a bold, brightly colored fabric, you might want to choose a muted, neutral-toned frame to balance it out. On the other hand, if your fabric has a more subtle or muted pattern, you might want to go for a bolder, more eye-catching frame to create contrast. Another key consideration when choosing your materials is the size of your wall hanging. If you have a smaller piece of fabric, you may want to select a frame with a more intricate design, as this will help to draw the eye and create interest in the piece. For larger pieces of fabric, a simpler, more streamlined frame might be more appropriate, as it will allow the fabric to speak for itself and take center stage. Ultimately, when it comes to selecting the right fabric and frame for your wall hanging, there are no hard and fast rules. The key is to choose materials that you love and that complement each other in a way that feels visually cohesive and pleasing to the eye. Whether you go for bold and eclectic or subtle and understated, the end result will be a beautiful piece of art that reflects your unique taste and style."},{"instruction":"Premise: The old warehouses have been transformed into upscale apartments and fashionable office buildings, and there is a buzz of chic commercial activity that has spawned smart restaurants and wine bars.

Leader Marine Le Pen hailed the results as a sign that the party's message is resonating with French voters. The local elections saw nearly 45 million people take to the polls to elect more than 36,000 mayors. Front National was able to capture several towns and cities, making significant gains in many areas. The party claimed that the results reflect a growing concern among French voters about immigration and the economic challenges facing the country. While some critics have dismissed the wins as isolated victories, Front National is now the largest party in several regions, making it a significant force in French politics. The party's success has also led to a political realignment, with other parties now having to adjust their strategies in response to Front National's rise. The results have sparked a debate about the future of France's political landscape. Some fear that the surge in support for Front National could lead to a more socially conservative and nationalist agenda. Others see the election results as a wake-up call for mainstream parties, which will need to work harder to address the concerns of French voters.

Dempsey's remarkable feat was achieved during a game against the Detroit Lions in Tulane Stadium, where he kicked the ball through a narrow gap between the crossbars using a specially designed shoe, due to his partial amputation of his right foot. Although Dempsey's record stood for 28 years until it was surpassed by a 64-yard field goal by Matt Prater in 2013, his kick remains one of the most iconic moments in NFL history. Dempsey's kick not only set a new record for the longest field goal in NFL history, but it also helped the Saints to secure a 19-17 victory over the Lions, which was their first win of the season. In conclusion, the player who holds the record for the second longest field goal in NFL history is Tom Dempsey, whose 63-yard kick remains an impressive achievement to this day.

It is always better to tell the truth, even if it is unpleasant, rather than resorting to lies or half-truths. Being honest builds trust and credibility and ensures that the person you are communicating with knows where they stand. However, it is equally important to focus on the good things. While honesty involves acknowledging flaws and shortcomings, it does not mean dwelling on them excessively. When discussing a project, for example, it is better to highlight the things that went well and the progress that was made before addressing any issues that arose. Focusing on the positives helps to create a sense of momentum and encourages a can-do attitude. Of course, problems cannot always be avoided, and there may be times when it is necessary to address them. However, it is important to be careful how this is done. If someone asks for your opinion on a matter, for instance, it is better to give honest feedback than to sugarcoat things. When addressing problems, focus on the solution and avoid blaming or shaming others. This helps to foster a collaborative environment where everyone is working towards a common goal. In summary, honesty is important, but it must be combined with a focus on the good things in order to create a positive and productive environment. When addressing problems, it is important to be diplomatic and solution-oriented. By following these principles, you can build strong relationships both at work and in your personal life."},{"instruction":"w similar are the following two sentences?

In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in smallworld networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method. Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the footandmouth virus in 2001.

To do so, follow these quick steps. First, determine where you want the valve to be located on the barrel. Drill a hole in the side of the barrel toward the top, making sure it's large enough for your valve to fit through. Next, insert your valve into the hole from the outside of the barrel, and screw it securely into place. This will allow you to control the flow of water or compost tea in and out of the barrel. However, you should also have an overflow system in place to prevent flooding. Without an overflow, the barrel could easily fill up during heavy rainfalls, leading to a mess and even water damage. To avoid this, drill a second hole at the top of the barrel, on the opposite side from the valve. This will allow excess water to flow out of the barrel and away from your property. If you don't want to drill a second hole or don't have the space for an overflow system, you can use a diverter instead. A diverter allows water to flow into the barrel from a downspout or other source, but redirects any excess water out and away from the barrel. This can be a simple and effective solution if you're short on space or don't have the tools for drilling.

First and foremost, it's crucial to avoid your triggers whenever possible. This may mean checking ingredient labels carefully or avoiding certain foods, such as peanuts or shellfish. If you have environmental allergies, take steps to cut down on dust in your home and control the movements of family pets. If you're spending time outside, be sure to avoid insect bites by wearing protective clothing and using insect repellent. When preparing food, use caution and ensure that all utensils and surfaces are clean to avoid cross-contamination. If you have a drug allergy, it's important to inform all medical staff so they can avoid prescribing medications that could cause a reaction. And if you do experience a severe allergic reaction, keep your EpiPen with you at all times and use it as directed. In addition, it's important to take your medication as directed and get allergy shots, if recommended by your doctor. These can help reduce the severity of your allergy symptoms and may even prevent future allergic reactions altogether. Living with allergies can be challenging, but by taking these important steps, you can reduce your risk of an allergic reaction and stay safe and healthy."},{"instruction":"f Craftsmen and architects were imported from Europe and England; the Georgian squares like Merrion Square in south Dublin were created at this time., can we conclude that Craftsmen and architects were underpaid by Europe and England to create the Georgian squares.?

The nitrogen content of plant tissues averages about 2%, while in fungi, animals, and bacteria it averages about 5% to 10%.

All animals' diets must provide sufficient amounts of the basic building blocks they need, up to the point where their particular biology can synthesize the rest. Animal tissue contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates (sugar, starch, and fiber), amino acids (in proteins), fatty acids (in lipids), and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). These compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and so on.

If you're wondering how to cut aluminum, here are some tips to help you get the job done: 1. Choose the Right Saw: A wood-cutting saw with carbide-tipped blades is the ideal tool for cutting most types of aluminum. These blades are made specifically for cutting metal, which means they are strong enough to handle the task without dulling quickly. 2. Use Cutting Lubricants: To make your cuts even smoother, apply cutting lubricant to your blades or bits. This will not only help to cool the blade but also lubricate it, which in turn will reduce friction and prevent the blade from getting too hot. 3. Reduce Blade Diameter: For better results, reduce the diameter of the cutting blade. This will reduce the amount of heat that builds up during cutting and keep your cuts more precise. 4. Secure Aluminum Piece: Before cutting, make sure to secure your aluminum piece with a C-clamp or other suitable clamp to keep it from moving or slipping during cutting. 5. Feed Aluminum Through Blade: When cutting aluminum, you can either feed the aluminum through the blade or the blade through the aluminum. Which method you choose will depend on the thickness and size of the piece you're cutting. 6. Adjust Blade Depth: When using a saw to cut aluminum, it's important to adjust the blade depth so the blade extends no more than 1/4 inch. This will help to prevent the blade from binding and breaking. 7. Use Jigsaw for Circular Cuts: If you need to make circular cuts in your aluminum piece, consider using a jigsaw instead of a saw. A jigsaw is ideal for making curved or circular cuts and can help you achieve more precise cuts with less effort. In conclusion, cutting aluminum can be made easy if you have the right tools and know the proper techniques.

Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"There are several pieces of evidence that support the claim that teaching abstinence is the most effective approach for children too young for sex: 1. A study conducted by the American College of Pediatrics found that abstinence education is effective in delaying sexual initiation and reducing sexual risk behaviors among youth. 2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified abstinence as one of the most effective ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. 3. According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, teenagers who have high levels of sexual education that emphasizes abstinence are more likely to delay their sexual debut. 4. Research has shown that comprehensive sex education, which includes information about both abstinence and contraception, may actually increase the likelihood of sexual activity among young people. Overall, these findings suggest that teaching abstinence to children who are not yet sexually active is a responsible approach that can help to reduce the risk of STIs and unintended pregnancies."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: what is the largest cathedral in new york city?","output":"St. Patrick's Cathedral is the largest cathedral in New York City."},{"instruction":"New Orleans , Post Gustav We did n't get the worst of Gustav but we 're still dealing with our share of the effects .

According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, only 0.2% of commuters in Dallas reported cycling as their primary mode of transportation to work in 2009. In contrast, 9.9% of commuters reported carpooling with others. The reasons behind this discrepancy are varied. Dallas is a large and spread-out city with limited bike infrastructure, making it less feasible for many people to use cycling as a way to get to work. In addition, the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is known for its car-centric culture, which means that many people prefer to drive alone or carpool rather than use other modes of transportation. Despite the challenges facing cyclists in Dallas, there are still many benefits to choosing a bike over a car for commuting. Cycling is an environmentally friendly option that can help reduce traffic congestion, and it is also a great way to get exercise and fresh air. For those who are interested in trying cycling as a commuting option, there are resources available such as bike share programs, cycling communities, and advocacy organizations that can provide information and support. In conclusion, while carpooling is currently a more popular commuting option than cycling in Dallas, there are certainly advantages to using a bike instead of a car. As the city continues to grow and change, it is possible that we may see more and more commuters choosing to ride bikes to work in the future."},{"instruction":"ere is some data: Bacon Explosion, ingredient, Bacon; Bacon Explosion, mainIngredient, Sausage.

The 38-year-old Briton has reportedly not eaten for five days as she sits in prison on suspicion of drug trafficking. According to her lawyer, she has fallen into a depression, exacerbated by her separation from her child. Dougall's arrest came as part of an investigation into a drug trafficking operation involving several British nationals. The arrests followed the apprehension of Lindsay Sandiford, who was allegedly caught with nearly 5kg of cocaine in the lining of a suitcase. It is believed that Sandiford agreed to help police catch other members of the drug gang after being offered a ¬£1 bowl of chilli fried rice.

Her hunger strike and pleas for her child have garnered sympathy from many, who see her as a victim caught up in a dangerous world beyond her control.

However, party leader Ed Miliband has refused to let him announce the move, causing friction between the two. Burnham's pledge comes amid increasing reports of him being the favourite to succeed Miliband as opposition leader. The increasing number of drunk people seeking treatment in A&E has posed a challenge for health chiefs, exacerbating waiting times for others in need of treatment. The proposed crackdown on drunks in A&E is a bold step towards an issue that has been plaguing the healthcare sector for a long time. Hospitals have been grappling with overcrowding, long waiting times, and stretched resources. Drunk people often take up valuable resources and healthcare professionals' time, delaying treatment for others who are in urgent need. The friction between Burnham and Miliband is an indication of the differing opinions within the party. While Burnham believes that a crackdown on drunks in A&E is necessary to ensure the efficient functioning of hospitals, Miliband seems to be hesitant to take such a strong stance on the issue. The rising number of drunk people seeking treatment in A&E is a concerning trend. Not only does it cause chaos and delays for hospital staff and other patients, but it also puts the drunk individuals at risk. They are more likely to be involved in accidents and injuries due to their impaired state, which may require emergency medical attention. In conclusion, tackling the issue of drunks in A&E is a pressing concern for the healthcare sector. Burnham's pledge to crack down on this issue is a step in the right direction.

This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile.

When brainstorming your story, it's essential to keep your theme in mind. Consider what message you want to convey and how you can represent it through your story. Your theme can be an idea, emotion, or belief that you want to explore in your writing. Understanding your character's motivation is also critical when creating a story. What drives them to take the actions they do, and how does that impact the plot? Developing complex and well-rounded characters is crucial to keeping readers engaged. Every good story needs conflict to keep it interesting. Think about the obstacles your characters will face and how they will overcome them. This could be anything from overcoming personal fears to battling a physical enemy. Research is an essential component of creating a compelling story. Look for information that can support your theme and add depth to your plot. This could include historical events, scientific facts, or cultural traditions.

While you may be tempted to spend your break scrolling through social media or catching up on emails, it's important to use your break time effectively to reset your mind and get back on track when you return to your work. One way to maximize your break time is by physically leaving the office. Taking a walk or sitting outside in a park can help clear your mind and provide a change of scenery. While you're away, take the opportunity to jot down any problems or challenges you're facing at work. Writing them down can help you organize your thoughts and come up with solutions. Another effective way to use your break time is to vent to someone you trust. Whether it's a friend or a colleague, talking through your frustrations with someone who understands can help you gain perspective and release negative emotions. If you're in need of a mood boost, turn to music. Listening to upbeat or calming music can instantly improve your mood and help you feel more relaxed. Similarly, watching funny videos or reading a humorous article can make you laugh and boost endorphins, which can help reduce stress and boost productivity. It's also important to acknowledge and process any difficult emotions that may be weighing on you. If you need to cry, don't be afraid to let it out. Holding in emotions can lead to increased stress and burnout. Finally, when you're ready to get back to work, start by completing easy tasks to help get the momentum going. Simple tasks like cleaning your workspace or responding to a short email can help you feel accomplished and motivated to tackle more challenging tasks. In conclusion, taking a break from work is vital for optimal productivity and well-being. By using your break time effectively, you can reset your mind and return to work with a fresh perspective and renewed energy.

But Kathy Gyngell asks whether he has considered that not every mother wants to rush back to work after giving birth.","output":"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg recently made the announcement that he plans to work towards an end to the high costs of child care. However, not everyone is convinced that this is necessarily the solution to the problem. Kathy Gyngell has raised an interesting point, questioning whether Clegg and those who agree with him have taken into account the fact that not all mothers necessarily want to rush back to work after having a child. While it is true that child care costs can be prohibitively high, it is not necessarily the case that increasing access to child care will be a universally positive thing. There are many factors to consider when it comes to child care, including the level of care that is available and the quality of that care. Additionally, it is important to recognize that child care is not necessarily the best option for every family. Some mothers may feel more comfortable staying home with their children, while others may have other arrangements that work better for their unique situation. While there is no doubt that providing more affordable child care options is a step in the right direction, it is important that policy makers consider the broader ramifications of their decisions. This means taking into account the diverse needs of families and recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of high child care costs. In the end, it will be up to individual families to determine what is best for them, and policy makers must do their best to support a range of options that will allow families to make the choices that are right for them."},{"instruction":"f A band of middleaged men, all wearing black shirts, are performing in front of a blue backdrop with a Lite Beer logo on it., does it logically follow that A group of women sit.?

Officials refused to answer whether or not they warned rebels before the August 21 attack on a suburb of Damascus. Members of the opposition say they were given no advance warning. According to U.S. estimates, 1,429 people died in the nervegas attack including 426 children.","output":"The recent U.S. intelligence report released by the Obama Administration has raised questions about whether or not the government had advance knowledge of the chemical attack in Syria that occurred on August 21st. The report indicates that the government knew about the attack three days before it occurred, but officials have refused to comment on whether or not they warned the rebels before the attack took place. This has caused concern among members of the opposition, who claim that they were given no advance warning about the attack. According to U.S. estimates, over 1,400 Syrians died in the nerve-gas attack, including hundreds of children. The attack led to international outrage and calls for a military response by Western nations. The fact that the U.S. government had advance knowledge of the attack raises questions about their involvement in the Syrian conflict and their level of responsibility for the tragic loss of life. While it is unclear what actions, if any, were taken to prevent the chemical attack, the revelation that the government knew about it beforehand has only added to the complexity and controversy surrounding the situation in Syria. As the conflict in Syria continues to rage on with no clear end in sight, it is important for the international community to work together to find a peaceful solution that will protect the lives of innocent civilians. The U.S. government's knowledge of the chemical attack highlights the urgent need for transparency and accountability in the handling of this crisis, and underscores the importance of finding a diplomatic solution to this ongoing conflict."},{"instruction":"Site member built poll asking if president should be killed.

The controversial poll offered four possible responses - \\"yes,\\" \\"maybe,\\" \\"if he cuts my health care\\" and \\"no.\\" Facebook has long been known for letting third-party developers create applications such as polls and quizzes. However, in this instance, the poll in question crossed the line. The social media site has since taken action and removed the app in question, stating that they do not tolerate any content that promotes violence or harm towards an individual or group. This is not the first time that Facebook has come under scrutiny for allowing harmful or offensive content to be shared on its platform. In recent years, they have taken a number of measures to address this issue, including hiring additional content moderators, removing bogus accounts, and using machine learning to detect and remove inappropriate content more efficiently. Social media has a huge impact on society, and companies such as Facebook have a responsibility to ensure that their platforms are a safe and positive space for users. The removal of this poll is just one example of how Facebook is taking steps to protect its users and prevent harmful content from spreading. Nevertheless, it is important for individuals to remember to use their social media accounts responsibly, and not to promote or condone violence in any form."},{"instruction":"f With respect to the Federalism Order, they state that HUD has determined that the policies contained in the rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government., can we conclude that The plan was written to avoid having direct effects on States. ?

At that time, the Guarani inhabited a vast territory that extended from the north of today's Argentina to the south of Brazil, and included parts of Uruguay and Paraguay. It is estimated that there were around 300,000 Guarani people at the time of the arrival of the first Europeans in the region, in the early sixteenth century. However, the Guarani population suffered a drastic decline over the next centuries due to various factors, such as diseases brought by the Europeans, enslavement, and displacement from their territory. In the specific context of 1756, the Guarani population was concentrated in several Jesuit missions, which had been established by the Society of Jesus in order to convert the indigenous people to Christianity and protect them from the slave hunters who roamed the region. The Jesuit missions were semi-autonomous communities that were run by the Guarani with the guidance of the Jesuit priests. Each mission had its own population, which usually ranged from a few hundred to several thousand people. According to historical records, the largest mission at the time was San Ignacio Guaz√∫, which had around 5,000 inhabitants. Other significant missions included Santa Mar√≠a la Mayor (3,000 people) and Jes√∫s de Tavarang√º√© (2,500 people). It is important to note that these figures are approximate and may not reflect the total Guarani population in 1756, as some groups may have lived outside of the missions or in smaller settlements.

Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than 50 cm (20 in). High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can be as low as ‚àí40 ¬∞C (‚àí40 ¬∞F), and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately ‚àí68 ¬∞C (‚àí90 ¬∞F). Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas.

Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the Habsburg realm, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians.

For individuals who have busy schedules, sporadic volunteer opportunities might be the best option. These types of opportunities are usually short-term and do not require a long-term commitment. They are perfect for individuals who want to contribute but cannot commit to regular or ongoing time commitments. Examples of sporadic volunteer opportunities include assisting during community events or providing help during emergency situations. On the other hand, if you have a schedule that allows you to commit to regular activities, recurring volunteer positions might be an excellent choice. Volunteering on a regular basis allows you to get involved with a cause that you are passionate about and make real progress towards creating change in your community. Examples of recurring volunteer activities include teaching or mentoring children, providing assistance to elders, or working at local shelters. In addition to these two options, local non-profits are always in need of volunteers and are a great place to start your search. These organizations often have opportunities ranging from administrative tasks to more hands-on activities. Non-profit organizations are also great places to make new friends who share the same passion for helping others. For individuals who want to commit to a full-time volunteering position and have the means to do so, the Peace Corps is an excellent option. Peace Corps volunteers make a two-year commitment to living and working in another country, helping with various community development projects. This program offers a unique opportunity for individuals to immerse themselves in a different culture while making a positive impact. In conclusion, there are various ways to give back to your community, and the type of volunteer position you choose will depend on your personal preferences and lifestyle. Whether you prefer short-term, sporadic volunteer opportunities or long-term, recurring positions, there is something for everyone. Do your research, inquire at local non-profits or organizations and find the right opportunity that best suits you."},{"instruction":"ere is a premise: For see you, the upper air is filled with phlogiston, which no man can breathe.

Here are some of the most significant battles that Alexander commanded at: 1. Battle of Granicus (334 BC): This was Alexander's first major battle against the Persians after crossing the Hellespont into Asia. Despite being outnumbered, Alexander's cavalry charge led to a stunning victory over the Persian forces. 2. Battle of Issus (333 BC): In this battle, Alexander faced the Persian king Darius III personally. Through skillful maneuvering and tactics, Alexander emerged victorious, taking control of much of Asia Minor. 3. Siege of Tyre (332 BC): This was a grueling siege that lasted for months, as Alexander's forces attempted to capture the island city of Tyre. Through clever engineering and determination, Alexander ultimately succeeded in conquering the city. 4. Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC): This was perhaps the most significant battle of Alexander's life, as he faced Darius III once again in a decisive showdown. Alexander's decisive victory secured his control over the Persian Empire and cemented his place in history as one of the greatest military commanders of all time. 5.

The psychological effect of seeing faces is called pareidolia.","output":"Recently, researchers from California made a fascinating discovery on Mars. They were able to capture an image of what appears to be a face on the planet's surface. This discovery was made using the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a spacecraft that was launched by NASA in 2005. The face is estimated to be around 1,640ft (500m) across and has several distinguishable facial features. It's important to note that this is not the first time that researchers have identified a face on Mars. The first time this happened was back in 1976 when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured an image of what appeared to be a human face. However, subsequent images revealed that the face was really just a trick of light and shadow. The newly identified face on Mars is believed to have been created by shifting carbon dioxide ice at the Martian pole. This process is known as sublimation, where a solid substance transitions directly into a gas without first becoming a liquid. As the ice shifts and changes, it can create patterns that resemble recognizable shapes, such as human faces. This phenomenon is not unique to Mars. In fact, humans are highly adept at recognizing faces, even in inanimate objects or natural scenery. This psychological phenomenon is known as pareidolia, and it's thought to be a result of our brain's tendency to seek out patterns and make sense of them. Pareidolia can cause us to see faces in clouds, rocks, and even burnt toast. Overall, the discovery of a face on Mars is both intriguing and scientifically significant. It's a reminder of the complex and dynamic processes that shape our universe, and the amazing technologies that allow us to study and understand them.

Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.

Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle (doctrine of the two kingdoms).

Luther's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture; 1523). Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his representative church government. The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church selfgovernment.

These fatty acids have been found to benefit cardiovascular health, improve cognitive function, and reduce inflammation in the body. However, not all Omega-3 supplements are made equal. When choosing an Omega-3 supplement, it's important to consider the source and purity of the product. Choose a reputable manufacturer who uses third-party testing to verify the levels of EPA and DHA in their supplements. It's also important to check the supplement label or company website for mercury levels. Consuming mercury can have detrimental effects on the body, and many fish sources of EPA and DHA can contain high levels of this harmful toxin. Therefore, it's crucial to choose a supplement that is low in mercury. When it comes to dosages of EPA and DHA, look for a supplement that provides at least 300 mg of DHA and 220 mg EPA. These are the specific Omega-3 fatty acids that have been linked to numerous health benefits, and higher doses have been found to be more effective in some cases. Lastly, pay attention to the taste and smell of the supplement. A strong fishy odor or taste may indicate that the supplement is of lower quality and has gone rancid. Opt for a supplement that has a neutral taste and odor or is flavored with natural ingredients. In conclusion, choosing the right Omega-3 supplement involves careful consideration of quality, purity, and dosage.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A recent survey has revealed that drivers on motorways who stop off at service stations to purchase food may end up paying almost three times the prices found in regular shops. This means that the average four-person picnic that costs ¬£15 from Asda could potentially cost as much as ¬£32 when purchased from a service station. The survey‚Äôs findings have sparked criticism from motorists and consumer advocates who pointed out that service stations already charge more for fuel and that the hike in food prices is unjustifiable. The study, which was conducted by consumer group Which?, found that items such as sandwiches, crisps, and drinks can cost up to 91% more at service stations compared to their regular retail prices. It‚Äôs not just small items that come at a premium cost; larger meal deals and hot food can also be significantly more expensive at service stations. The study found that a meal deal at a service station could cost up to ¬£2 more than a similar one purchased from a high street store. Consumer advocates are pushing for more transparency from service stations when it comes to pricing. They are also asking for government intervention to regulate pricing and to ensure that motorists are not taken advantage of. In conclusion, it‚Äôs clear that motorists who stop off at service stations may end up paying a high price for food. To avoid being caught out, it‚Äôs advisable to plan ahead and to bring your own snacks and drinks. This can not only save you money but also give you greater control over what you eat. In the long run, this could be a healthier and more cost-effective option for drivers."},{"instruction":"Of which Pacific country is Papeete the capital????","output":"Papeete is the capital of French Polynesia."},{"instruction":"Slam Creepers were a rock band from Vansbro, Sweden formed by Bj√∂rn Skifs in 1962 and broke up in 1969.

The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community. The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective counterterrorism or counterintelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change. For example, FBI personnel practices continue to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI's auto mechanics and janitors.

He says the public has had four years to make a judgment about the president. Obama can learn from second term speeches of Lincoln, Wilson, FDR. Zelizer says they did a good job of unifying America and sketching vision of the future.","output":"Writing a Second Term Inaugural Address: Lessons from History According to Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, delivering a second term inaugural address is a daunting task for any president. Unlike the first time around, voters have now had four years to evaluate the performance of the incumbent and are more likely to have formed opinions about their leadership style, policy priorities, and overall vision for the country. Nonetheless, Zelizer argues that a well-crafted second term speech can still inspire and unite Americans, as past presidents have demonstrated. He points to Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin D. Roosevelt as examples of leaders who rose to the challenge and delivered memorable addresses that advanced their agendas and appealed to a broad cross-section of the population. What can President Barack Obama learn from their speeches? Zelizer highlights several themes that he believes are particularly relevant for today's political climate. First, he argues that successful second term inaugurals tend to focus on shared values and aspirations, rather than partisan differences. By emphasizing what unites Americans ‚Äì such as freedom, justice, and opportunity ‚Äì rather than what divides them, a president can build momentum for his agenda and appeal to voters who may have previously opposed him. Second, Zelizer suggests that a compelling second term address should articulate a coherent vision of the future, not just a laundry list of policy proposals. Presidents who can paint a vivid picture of where the country is headed and how their policies will get us there are more likely to inspire confidence and support from the public. Finally, Zelizer notes that second term inaugurals also provide an opportunity to reflect on the president's legacy and place in history. By invoking the ideals and achievements of past presidents and other American heroes, a leader can tap into the country's sense of pride and identity, and inspire citizens to work together to build a better future. Of course, crafting a successful second term inaugural address is easier said than done. It requires a deep understanding of the political landscape, a talent for persuasive rhetoric, and a clear sense of the president's own values and priorities. But by studying the examples of Lincoln, Wilson, and Roosevelt, President Obama can learn valuable lessons about how to use this important moment to advance his agenda and unite the country around a common vision."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: AZ Alkmaar, manager, John van den Brom","output":"John van den Brom manages AZ Alkmaar."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about Eton College.","output":"What is the origin and history of Eton College?"},{"instruction":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? wo n't score points for political correctness OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"Negative."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Click below for his unctuous commentary on this.
