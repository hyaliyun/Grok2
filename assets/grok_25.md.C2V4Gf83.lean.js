This table has been both surprising and interesting, as it shows a variety of changes in the league positions from the current standings. Firstly, if only goals scored by English players were counted, Arsenal would lead the Premier League. This would be due to the contributions of Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere. Interestingly though, all their wins would have been by just 1-0, which shows a lack of contribution from other players. The top four teams in the Premier League would be vastly different if only English players' goals were counted. Swansea City, Liverpool and West Brom would occupy the second, third and fourth positions respectively. Most football fans would be surprised to see such a shift in rankings, as these teams are not favourites to finish in the top four this season. On the other hand, Manchester United, a team that dominates the Premier League with their star players, would be sitting in mid-table. Only Wayne Rooney would be contributing to their goal tally, which shows a lack of diversity in scoring. What is perhaps most shocking in this table is the position of the current Premier League leaders, Chelsea. If only goals scored by English players were counted, they would find themselves in relegation places. This shows how heavily Chelsea rely on international players for their success. Overall, this table provides an interesting insight into how the Premier League would look if only English players' goals were counted.

As with any pet, proper care and attention are crucial to their health and well-being. When it comes to breeding cichlids, there are several steps you can take to ensure success. Firstly, ensure you have both males and females of the species you wish to breed. Next, be sure to feed them an appropriate amount of food. Overfeeding can lead to health issues and even death, so moderation is key. Any health issues that arise should be treated promptly. Be on the lookout for any signs of illness, such as strange behavior or physical abnormalities, and take action as soon as possible. When your cichlids are ready to breed, they will become more active and aggressive. Females may lay eggs on flat surfaces, so be sure to provide appropriately sized and placed substrate for spawning. At this point, it’s crucial to monitor the cichlids for attraction and breeding behavior. The male may display bright colors and enlarge his finnage to attract the female. Once mating occurs, the male will fertilize the eggs and both parents will tend to them. If you notice that the breeding process isn’t progressing as expected, you may need to step in and provide some assistance. This could involve removing any eggs or fry that are in danger or adding supplements to the water to encourage spawning. The final step is simply to observe the breeding process and ensure that the eggs are properly cared for until they hatch. With the right care and attention, your cichlids can thrive and produce healthy offspring, adding to the beauty and diversity of your aquatic collection."},{"instruction":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

However, the resulting resistive impedance achieved will be quite a bit lower than the impedance of a resonant monopole, likely requiring further impedance matching. In addition to a lower radiation resistance, the reactance becomes higher as the antenna size is reduced, and the resonant circuit formed by the antenna and the tuning coil has a Q factor that rises and eventually causes the bandwidth of the antenna to be inadequate for the signal being transmitted.

It facilitates efficient accomplishment of tasks, fosters a positive work environment, and improves employee satisfaction. However, communication breakdowns can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and decrease productivity. To ensure that communication in the workplace is effective, organizations can use tools such as conflict style indicators or personality style indicators. A conflict style indicator identifies the preferred style of an individual in conflict situations. These indicators typically outline five styles, namely accommodating, avoiding, collaborating, competing, and compromising. Accommodating individuals prioritize the needs of others over their own, and seek to find common ground. Avoiding individuals tend to withdraw from conflict situations to avoid confrontation. Collaborating individuals seek win-win solutions that benefit all parties involved. Competing individuals prioritize their own needs over others and seek to win the conflict. Compromising individuals try to find solutions that partially satisfy the needs of all parties. Personality style indicators help to identify an individual's personality traits, their strengths, and weaknesses. They provide insights into how an individual communicates, interacts, and approaches work-related situations. The commonly used personality style indicator is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which categorizes individuals based on their preferences on four dimensions: Extraversion vs Introversion, Sensing vs Intuition, Thinking vs Feeling, and Judging vs Perceiving. Using these tools can help individuals and teams understand their communication styles better, as well as identify areas for improvement. For example, if a team member prefers an accommodating conflict style, they may need to practice communicating their own needs more assertively. Similarly, if a team member tends to avoid conflicts, they may need to learn how to communicate their thoughts and feelings more effectively. In conclusion, communication breakdowns can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and decreased productivity. To ensure effective communication in the workplace, organizations can use conflict style indicators or personality style indicators to identify individual communication styles and improve them where necessary. This approach will foster a positive work environment, improve employee satisfaction, and ultimately benefit the organization's success."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude that Bill was hungry. if the statement Bill passed the halfempty plate to John because he was hungry. is true?

In 1858, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steelmaking by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow.

Featherstone's decision has put the Government at odds with the quango, which was set up to provide guidance on equality-related issues. Featherstone's move is centered around the issue of transgender rights. The Minister has announced plans to make it easier for transgender individuals to change their legal gender, including by removing the requirement for medical procedures such as gender reassignment surgery. This move has been criticized by some as a departure from the recommendations of the government's own equality quango, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The EHRC has previously recommended that the process for legal gender recognition should include medical procedures, arguing that this provides a safeguard against people who might fraudulently claim to be transgender. Featherstone's move, however, has been welcomed by transgender rights advocates, who argue that the current process is overly intrusive and medicalized. The decision has raised concerns about the government's commitment to its own equality agenda. Critics have accused Featherstone of disregarding the EHRC's recommendations and undermining the work of the quango, which was established to provide independent guidance on equality-related issues. Featherstone, however, has defended her position, arguing that the government has a duty to protect the rights of transgender individuals, who often face discrimination and harassment. She has also emphasized the importance of allowing individuals to define their own gender, rather than being subject to medical diagnosis. The controversy highlights the complex nature of navigating issues related to equality and human rights. While the government has established the EHRC to provide guidance on these issues, it is ultimately responsible for making policy decisions that balance competing interests and conflicting perspectives. Whether Featherstone's move represents a positive step forward for transgender rights, or a departure from the government's own equality agenda, remains a matter of debate."},{"instruction":"Goal: To clean the lens of your camera, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?

In his opinion, the model solution should be the successful removal of chemical weapons from Syria, which shows that peace can be achieved through international cooperation. The Middle East has been plagued by conflict and instability for decades, but Oren believes there is hope for a peaceful resolution to the region's problems. One key element to this resolution is the removal of Hamas rocket stockpiles from Gaza. Oren suggests that United States inspectors could oversee this process, ensuring that the rockets are safely removed and the threat of future attacks is eliminated. In addition to this, Oren believes that international aid could play a crucial role in repairing Gaza's economy, which has been decimated by years of conflict. By providing financial assistance and investment, the international community could help to rebuild the region and create new opportunities for its residents. Finally, Oren suggests that Israel could ease the blockade on Gaza, allowing for the free flow of goods and services. This would not only help to stimulate the region's economy, but also help to build trust and cooperation between Israel and Palestine.

The Commission was composed of representatives from various countries, with diverse political, legal, and cultural backgrounds. The drafting process took two years, and it involved extensive consultations and debates among the Commission members. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a landmark achievement in the history of human rights.

However, the wrong undergarments can ruin your mood and make you feel uncomfortable. To help you choose the right undergarments for support and comfort, consider the following tips. First and foremost, it is crucial to wear undergarments that fit. Undergarments that are too tight or too loose can make you feel uncomfortable and cause chafing or irritation. Therefore, choose undergarments that are your correct size and make you feel comfortable. Secondly, avoid undergarments that offer no support. Supportive undergarments help to hold everything in place and prevent sagging. On the other hand, unsupported undergarments can cause discomfort and ruin the look of any outfit. You may also want to try body-slimming undergarments. These undergarments are designed to give you a smoother, slimmer appearance by cinching and shaping the body. They can help you avoid panty lines and give you a little extra confidence with your outfit. Lastly, consider wearing nylon stockings with a \\"control top\\". These stockings provide additional support to help keep everything in place while also smoothing out any bumps or bulges. Plus, they provide an extra layer of warmth during cooler months. In summary, wearing the right undergarments can make a big difference in how comfortable and confident you feel. Therefore, choose undergarments that fit, offer support, consider body-slimming options and try nylon stockings with a “control top” to give you the support and comfort you need."},{"instruction":"Question: How many tourist visas were granted in 2003?

Dozens of Native Americans have died serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. Geronimo was an Apache leader in the late 1800s. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Native American officials and activists are speaking out against the use of Geronimo's name in connection with Osama bin Laden's death, arguing that it undermines the military service of Native people. Geronimo was an Apache leader in the late 1800s, and dozens of Native Americans have died serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. To link Geronimo with bin Laden is to perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Native people as savage and violent, say critics. The controversy began when it was revealed that \\"Geronimo\\" was the code name used for bin Laden in the military operation that killed him. This prompted immediate backlash from members of the Native American community, who see the use of Geronimo's name as an insult. According to Harlyn Geronimo, the great-grandson of the Apache leader, \\"We are very saddened as Native peoples to be used in this way, when one of our own is used to describe one of the most hated enemies of the United States.\\" Native American leaders have also pointed out that the use of Geronimo's name is not just offensive, but historically inaccurate. Geronimo was a warrior who fought to defend his homeland against invaders, whereas Bin Laden was a terrorist who targeted innocent civilians. To tie Geronimo to Bin Laden is to erase the contributions that Native Americans have made to the US military over the years, say activists. As noted by Deb Haaland, a Native woman who is now the Secretary of the Interior, \\"Native Americans have served in the military at the highest rate of any demographic group. We have sacrificed so much for our country and our people. Using the name of a Native American hero to describe a terrorist is just wrong.\\" In conclusion, the use of Geronimo's name in connection with bin Laden's death has sparked outcry from Native American activists, who argue that it erases the contributions of Native people to the military and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. Moving forward, it is important that we honor the sacrifices of Native Americans who have served in the military by using their names with respect and accuracy."},{"instruction":"ere are some concepts: cause, close, pier What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"The cause of the accident was a close encounter with a pier."},{"instruction":"This is some data: The Rice Boat eatType restaurant; The Rice Boat priceRange less than £20; The Rice Boat customer rating low; The Rice Boat area city centre; The Rice Boat familyFriendly no; The Rice Boat near Express by Holiday Inn.

He says Obama's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake.","output":"Renowned political commentator, David Gergen, believes that President Obama's State of the Union address could be a critical turning point for his second term. Gergen cautions that failure to bring the Republican Party to the negotiating table could result in a high-stakes budget fight that the country cannot afford. Gergen further argues that it would be an error for Democrats to adopt an uncompromising stance and assume they can win solely by refusing to negotiate. This approach could have dire consequences for the country in the long run as it risks exacerbating partisan division and gridlock in Washington. Moreover, Gergen opines that Obama's recent shift towards a more partisan approach is a big mistake. It sends the wrong message to Americans who are increasingly disillusioned with politics as usual, and this strategy will only serve to alienate further an already divided country. In conclusion, David Gergen's insights highlight the importance of President Obama's State of the Union address.

The baby was found dead in the back of the car by her older brother who spotted her on the way back from school. This horrific incident highlights the dangers of leaving children unattended in a car, especially in high temperatures. Leaving a child in a car can have devastating consequences. Heatstroke is the leading cause of child vehicular deaths, and it can occur even on a mild day. The temperature inside a car can rise rapidly, even with the windows slightly open. This can lead to dehydration, heatstroke, and death. It is crucial for parents and other caregivers to be aware of their surroundings and never leave a child unattended in a vehicle. In this case, James Hollingsworth, the grandfather of Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth, was the responsible party. As a result of his forgetfulness, he will now face criminal charges. This serves as a reminder that there are legal consequences for leaving a child unattended in a car. However, more important than avoiding criminal charges is preventing such tragedies from happening in the first place. It is the responsibility of adults to keep children safe. Those responsible for the care of children must develop strategies to ensure that no child is left unattended in a car. Parents, caregivers, and family members can take simple steps like placing a diaper bag or a purse in the backseat next to the child as a reminder. In conclusion, the death of Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth is a tragic reminder of the importance of being vigilant when it comes to the safety of children. As a society, we must remain vigilant to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. It is important to remember that the safety of children is paramount, and we all have a role to play in ensuring their wellbeing."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence His first visit to the area was in 1923 and he maintained a strong tie there until the end of his life. answer the question Where did Adolf Hitler establish a home in the 1930s?

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Underrated Talent of Jack Colback Jack Colback is a name that has been overlooked by many in the football world, both clubs, and national teams. But his recent move to Newcastle United can be considered as one of the bravest transfers in recent times, comparable to Sol Campbell's switch from Tottenham to Arsenal. Colback's journey to Newcastle has been an interesting one. He grew up supporting the club and played for their academy but was released as a teenager. However, this setback did not stop him from pursuing his dreams, and he signed for Sunderland, where he made his first-team debut in 2009. Despite being a homegrown talent, Colback did not receive the recognition he deserved. He was overlooked by England and other top teams, but that didn't stop him from delivering consistent performances on the field. Sunderland's former coach, Gus Poyet, trusted Colback in midfield, and his form was phenomenal. Colback's performances caught the eye of Newcastle United, and they signed him in 2014. This move was criticized by Sunderland's fans, but it was a dream come true for Colback. He was finally playing for his boyhood club, and he wanted to show his worth. Colback's impact was immediate, and he established himself as a key player for Newcastle. He played an essential role in their midfield and earned the respect of his teammates and fans alike. However, his time at Newcastle was marred by injuries, and he struggled for consistency. As a result, he was loaned to Nottingham Forest in 2018. Despite his injury problems, Colback's talent was still evident. He helped Forest reach the playoffs in the 2018-19 season, and his performances earned him a permanent move. He has been a consistent performer for Forest since then and is widely regarded as one of their best players. In conclusion, the talent of Jack Colback has been overlooked for too long. He may not have had the chance to play for England or at the top level, but he has proven time and time again that he is a reliable midfielder. His move to Newcastle was a dream come true, and he remains a fan favorite at the club. The football world needs to recognize his ability and acknowledge the impact he has on the game."},{"instruction":"Just in time for Halloween, Titan has put on a ghostly show near its north and south poles.

Security Council has scheduled a special meeting for Tuesday to address the ongoing crisis in Yemen. This comes after Yemen's information minister described recent events as an attempt to seize power. The situation escalated when the presidential chief of staff was abducted, prompting security measures such as the closing of roads. The situation in Yemen has been volatile for years, with various factions jockeying for power and influence. The current crisis appears to involve a power struggle between the government and separatist forces backed by the United Arab Emirates. The abduction of the presidential chief of staff is believed to be connected to this struggle. Yemen's information minister, Muammar Al-Eryani, has been vocal about the situation, accusing the separatists of attempting to stage a coup.

In today's fast-paced world, we have become accustomed to instant gratification and the idea of waiting can be unbearable. However, there are times when waiting is necessary and even beneficial. For example, waiting before eating can aid in digestion. When we eat too fast, our body doesn't have enough time to produce the necessary enzymes to break down food properly. Waiting for a few minutes before digging in allows for our digestive system to get ready, which can prevent indigestion and bloating. Similarly, when we exercise, we must allow for our muscles to cool down before resting. Waiting for 12 to 15 minutes to do some light stretches or to walk around can help minimize soreness and stiffness after a workout. Waiting can also be a necessary component of decision-making. When faced with a difficult choice, we may feel the urge to make an impulsive decision. However, taking a break and \\"waiting it out\\" can give us a chance to think things through and make a more informed decision. Finally, waiting can simply be a way to practice patience and mindfulness. We live in a world where we are constantly bombarded with notifications, advertisements and distractions. Sometimes, all we need is to step back and wait for a few moments to reconnect with ourselves. In conclusion, \\"wait 12 to 15 minutes\\" may seem like a small instruction, but it can have big benefits. Whether it's for digestion, exercise, decision-making or simply practicing patience, waiting can be an important tool in our daily lives.

Walters does not score enough for a Premier League striker. Peter Crouch's best days are behind him he needs to rely on instincts. John Guidetti's loan move from Manchester City to Stoke is odd. Carrow Road tribute to Forbes was a class act.","output":"In recent times, Jonathan Walters has been drawing a lot of attention for his pace, or more accurately, his lack of it. The Stoke City striker could well be the slowest player in the Premier League. While his work rate and persistence on the pitch are commendable, his lack of speed has been a cause for concern amongst Stoke supporters. Walters' woes are compounded by his inability to score enough goals. For a Premier League striker, his goal-scoring record leaves a lot to be desired. Stoke City needs a player who can find the back of the net on a consistent basis, and Walters has fallen short in that department. Another Stoke City striker, Peter Crouch, is also finding it tough to stay relevant. While his towering height and a keen sense of positioning helped him score some memorable goals in the past, his best days are now behind him. Crouch needs to rely on his instincts and use all his experience to help Stoke City. In a strange move, John Guidetti, who had been on loan at Stoke City from Manchester City, has now moved to Feyenoord. Guidetti was expected to provide much-needed fire-power to Stoke's attack, but his loan move has left many puzzled. It remains to be seen if Stoke will be able to cope without Guidetti's services. Finally, the classy tribute paid by Carrow Road to Justin Forbes deserves special mention. The former Norwich City striker passed away at the tender age of 47 after a prolonged battle with cancer. Norwich City's gesture to pay their respects to him was touching and demonstrated the bond between the club and its former players. In conclusion, the Premier League is a league on the move, and football fans can expect many more twists and turns in the future."},{"instruction":"The final chapter in the trilogy , The Matrix Revolutions , is out in November .

In the mid-19th century, this made them ideal raiders, and Navajo warriors began to target nearby settlements for loot and livestock. The raids were fueled by a combination of factors. The Navajo were nomadic and relied on hunting and gathering, but they also raised livestock. As Euro-American settlers moved into the region, they fenced off land and cut off traditional hunting grounds for the Navajo. This led to conflict over resources, and the Navajo began to raid settlements for food and animals. However, the raids were not just about securing resources. They were also a show of strength and defiance against the growing encroachment of outsiders on Navajo land and culture. As the Navajo saw their way of life threatened, they turned to raiding as a means of resistance. The U.S. government responded to the raids with military force, launching a long and bloody campaign to subdue the Navajo. In 1864, the Navajo were forced to surrender and were forcibly marched to a reservation in eastern New Mexico. The Long Walk, as it became known, was a traumatic event in Navajo history and led to many years of struggle on the reservation. Today, the Navajo people still honor their warrior traditions, but they have also worked to build bridges with neighboring communities and find ways to thrive in the modern world.

However, when it comes to the single largest amount of money granted for sponsored research, the answer is the United States Department of Defense. In 2017, the Department of Defense awarded MIT a grant of 626 million for research into advanced materials and manufacturing processes. This grant, which was part of the broader Manufacturing USA initiative, marked the largest single grant in the school's history. The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, has provided funding for a wide range of research projects at MIT, including work in fields as diverse as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and climate science. While the NSF has supported a significant amount of research at the school over the years, none of its grants have exceeded the 626 million received from the Department of Defense. It's worth noting that while the Department of Defense has provided significant funding for research at MIT and other universities throughout the nation, there has been some debate over the years about the potential downsides of military funding for scientific research. Some critics argue that it can lead to the development of technologies that are primarily focused on military applications, rather than those that benefit society as a whole. Regardless of these concerns, there's no denying that both the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation have played important roles in supporting research at MIT and other institutions around the United States. While the largest grant in MIT's history may have come from the Department of Defense, it's clear that both agencies will continue to remain major sources of funding for cutting-edge research in the years to come."},{"instruction":"DreamWorks Shifts #39;Shrek 3 #39; To May 2007 DreamWorks has pushed back the release date of Shrek 3 from a November 2006 release to May 2007.

He was a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, including his policy on Ukraine. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Boris Nemtsov was a prominent figure in Russian politics and a champion of democracy and human rights. Born in Sochi in 1959, he rose to national prominence in the 1990s as a young and dynamic politician who served as the governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region and later as a deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin. After leaving government, Nemtsov became an opposition leader and a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin's authoritarian regime. He was a fierce advocate for democracy, free speech, and the rule of law, and he never shied away from speaking out against corruption, injustice, and human rights abuses in Russia. Nemtsov's opposition to Putin's policies on Ukraine was especially noteworthy. He was a strong supporter of Ukraine's pro-democracy movement and a staunch opponent of Russia's annexation of Crimea. He spoke out forcefully against Putin's aggressive actions in Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Tragically, Nemtsov's commitment to democracy and human rights cost him his life. In February 2015, he was murdered in central Moscow as he walked across a bridge near the Kremlin. The killing shocked the world and sparked outrage among pro-democracy activists in Russia and around the globe. Despite an investigation, the mastermind behind Nemtsov's killing has never been identified, and questions about the motives and circumstances surrounding his death continue to linger. Boris Nemtsov will long be remembered as a courageous and principled leader who fought tirelessly for democracy and human rights in Russia. His legacy lives on in the ongoing struggle for freedom and justice in his homeland, and he remains a symbol of hope and inspiration for all those who believe in the power of democracy to bring positive change to the world."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = Zizzi, eatType = pub, food = Japanese, customer rating = 5 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"Yes. {name: \\"Zizzi\\", eatType: \\"pub\\", food: \\"Japanese\\", customerRating: 5, familyFriendly: true}"},{"instruction":"Based on the premise Take time off from the city bustle for a stroll through the Jardin des Tuileries, named after a 13thcentury tile works and now beautifully relandscaped as part of a renovation plan for the Musee du Louvre to the east., can we conclude the hypothesis Jardin des Tuileries has been relandscaped beautifully. is true?

Spray the peroxide evenly onto your hair. Rinse it out with cold water after 30 minutes.","output":"Hydrogen peroxide has been widely used as a hair lightening agent, and it is a common ingredient in many commercial hair dyes. However, it is important to use it correctly to avoid damaging your hair. To lighten your hair with hydrogen peroxide, you will need a spray bottle and a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide. Start by pouring the peroxide into the spray bottle and then spray it evenly onto your hair. Make sure you cover all of your hair, from the roots to the tips. Once you have applied the peroxide, let it sit for about 30 minutes. This should be enough time for the hydrogen peroxide to break down the natural pigment in your hair and lighten its color. Make sure you don't leave the peroxide in your hair for too long, as this can cause damage to your hair. After 30 minutes, rinse your hair thoroughly with cold water. This will help to remove any excess peroxide and balance the pH of your hair. You may also want to use a deep conditioning treatment after the rinse to help nourish your hair. It is important to note that hydrogen peroxide can lighten your hair, but it can also cause damage if not used correctly. Overuse of hydrogen peroxide can lead to dry, brittle hair and even breakage. It is best to use it sparingly and to always follow the instructions carefully. In conclusion, hydrogen peroxide can be an effective and affordable way to lighten your hair, but it should be used with caution. By following the above steps, you can safely use hydrogen peroxide to achieve the desired results."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Blythburgh is a village and civil parish in the Suffolk Coastal district of the English county of Suffolk.
