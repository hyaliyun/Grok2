At 28 years old, Hargrove was found strangled to death in her own home. After months of investigation, her boyfriend, Burrell Cushman, was charged with second-degree murder on Tuesday. This was not the first time that Hargrove had taken legal action against Cushman. In 2012, she obtained a restraining order against him. However, she eventually allowed him back into her life last fall. In her request for the restraining order, Hargrove wrote, \\"A piece of paper isn't going to save my life when he finally gets me, at least you will know who killed me.\\" Sadly, Hargrove's words proved prophetic. Despite her previous attempts to protect herself, she ultimately fell victim to violence at the hands of a man she once loved. Hargrove's story serves as a tragic reminder of the very real dangers of domestic violence and the importance of taking legal action to protect oneself from abusive partners. While a restraining order is not a fail-safe solution, it can provide a legal barrier between a victim and an abuser. It is important to take additional measures, such as seeking counseling, support from friends and family, and possibly finding a new place to live. The tragedy of Hargrove's story also highlights the need for community involvement in the fight against domestic violence. By raising awareness and supporting victims, we can work towards preventing tragic losses like Amy Hargrove's. It is not enough to simply rely on the law to protect us. We must all take an active role in recognizing and preventing abuse in our own communities."},{"instruction":"Do these mean the same?

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Offgrid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With gridtied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter.

To avoid this, it's best to focus on one task at a time. By giving your full attention to each task, you can ensure high-quality work and avoid mistakes.

This incident comes on the heels of the FBI's decision to remove hundreds of training documents that were deemed stereotypical and offensive to Muslims, including referring to the Prophet Muhammad as a \\"cult leader.\\" This move was seen as an important step toward repairing relations between law enforcement and the Muslim community, which has been strained in recent years. However, the actions of the soldiers in disposing of the holy books have once again emphasized the need for greater sensitivity and understanding when it comes to matters of religion and faith. It is understandable that soldiers, in the heat of battle, may not always be aware of the cultural significance of certain items, but it is important for them to be educated and informed so that they can avoid offending the communities they are trying to protect. The incident has also raised questions about the NYPD's monitoring of Muslim student groups on the East Coast, which has been criticized as invasive and discriminatory. While law enforcement certainly has a role to play in preventing acts of terrorism, it is equally important that they do not violate the civil rights and constitutional protections of any particular group.

Additionally, many people in this age group are starting families, which contributes to their larger population size. One factor that contributes to the relatively large size of the 25 to 34 age group is the aging of the Baby Boomer generation. As the Baby Boomers continue to age and pass away, younger age groups will become proportionally larger in comparison. However, the 25 to 34 age group is projected to remain one of the most populous groups in the coming years. It is important to note that population trends can vary by region and country. In some areas, different age groups may have larger or smaller populations depending on a variety of factors such as cultural norms, economic conditions, and government policies. Overall, understanding demographic trends and which age groups have the largest populations can be helpful for policymakers, businesses, and individuals in planning for the future."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: – It's been more than nine years, but the Mars rover Opportunity just made a discovery that ranks among its biggest. The rover has discovered rock in the Endeavour Crater that's full of what appear to be clay minerals—suggesting it had extended contact with water, the BBC reports. Despite talk of water, what Opportunity has mostly discovered, or found evidence for, was sulfuric acid, says a NASA rep. But clay minerals only tend to form at a more neutral pH. This is water you could drink. That points to intriguing possibilities: This is water that was much more favorable for things like prebiotic chemistry—the kind of chemistry that could lead to the origin of life, says the NASA spokesman. The fundamental conditions that we believe to be necessary for life were met here, he notes, per Space.com. It's not the first time Opportunity has found clay in the area—but the rock, called Esperance, has the highest concentrations the rover has seen. Opportunity, which landed in 2004, wasn't expected to last this long. The rover could have a catastrophic failure at any moment. So, each day is a gift, says another NASA spokesman.","output":"NASA's Mars rover Opportunity has discovered a rock containing clay minerals in Endeavour Crater, suggesting that the rock has had an extended contact with water.

A good rule of thumb is to use two tablespoons of coffee for every six ounces of water. Step 2: Add Sugar Next, add sugar to taste. If you're watching your sugar intake, you can use a sugar alternative like stevia or skip the sugar altogether. Step 3: Add Water Add hot water to the coffee/sugar mixture and stir well until the sugar dissolves. Allow the mixture to cool down to room temperature before proceeding to the next step. Step 4: Add Ice If desired, add ice to the coffee to chill it. You can use regular ice or coffee ice cubes made from leftover coffee. Step 5: Shake it Up Once the coffee has cooled and the ice is added, put everything in a shaker or a mason jar and shake it vigorously for 30-60 seconds. This will not only cool the coffee down further but also create a frothy texture that will enhance the flavor and presentation of your iced coffee.

Represent the probability of an impossible outcome with a 0.","output":"Calculating Probability: A Guide to Mutually Exclusive Events When it comes to measuring the likelihood of an outcome, probability is a powerful tool. However, before diving into the numbers, it's essential to define the events and outcomes that could occur. Start by choosing an event with outcomes that cannot overlap, meaning that they are mutually exclusive. Next, define all possible events and outcomes that could occur. For example, if a coin is flipped, the possible outcomes are heads or tails. If you roll a die, the possible outcomes are numbers 1 through 6. It's essential to identify all possible outcomes since the probability depends on them. Once you've defined the events and outcomes, you can calculate the probability of each event occurring. Divide the number of events by the number of possible outcomes to determine the likelihood of each event. For example, there are two possible outcomes when flipping a coin, so the probability of getting heads is 1/2. Finally, add up all possible event likelihoods to ensure they equal 1. If not, check your calculations and redefine the events and outcomes until the probability calculation is correct. If an impossible outcome exists, represent it with a 0 probability. Overall, calculating probability takes careful consideration of events, outcomes, and their likelihoods. By following these steps for mutually exclusive events, you can accurately determine the probability of an outcome."},{"instruction":"ere is some data about a restaurant: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, priceRange = more than £30, customer rating = high, area = city centre, familyFriendly = no.

With a tender crumb and a crusty exterior, it makes for a perfect accompaniment to soups, stews, and salads. Here's a step-by-step guide to making no-yeast soda bread at home. Preheat your oven to 425°F and take out a large baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, stir together 4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of salt, and any additional herbs or spices for seasoning. Next, stir in 1 1/2 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of vinegar into the dry mixture, using a spoon or spatula to gently fold them in until just combined. The dough will be sticky and shaggy. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it lightly for a minute or two, just until it comes together into a smooth ball. Avoid overworking the dough, or it will become tough and chewy. Shape the dough into a round or oval loaf, depending on your preference. Transfer it to the prepared baking pan and use a sharp knife to score the top of the loaf with a few shallow slashes. This will help the dough rise and expand while baking. Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes, until it's golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let it cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving. No-yeast soda bread is a versatile recipe that can be customized to your liking. Try adding grated cheese, chopped herbs, or even dried fruits and nuts to the dough for extra flavor and texture.

India and Poland are the top two sources of new migrants to England.","output":"According to the latest census data, London is no longer a majority white city. This development is a significant milestone, and it mirrors similar trends across other urban centres in the country. The data highlights that migration is a key factor in population growth, accounting for 60% of the increase from 2001 to 2011. India and Poland are the top two sources of new migrants to England, reflecting the country's colonial history and the EU's expansion in the early 2000s. Additionally, the data reveals several interesting socio-economic trends amongst the population. Britons are now better educated than ever, but they are also less likely to own a home than previous generations. The ongoing housing crisis in the country has contributed to this shift, with housing prices far outpacing wage growth. Furthermore, the data suggests that religion is playing a lesser role in people's lives, with fewer Britons identifying as religious than ever before. These demographic changes have several implications for society and politics. The rise of diversity in urban centres like London has forced people from different backgrounds to interact and collaborate more closely. While this has led to greater social cohesion, it has also triggered debates about the ownership of the country's collective identity. Meanwhile, the challenges around home ownership and affordability are contributing to the disenfranchisement of many who feel they have been left behind by a system that prioritises those who can afford to buy property. Overall, the latest census data underlines the importance of continued dialogue and understanding between people of different backgrounds. It also highlights the need for policymakers to address issues around housing and affordability, ensuring that everyone has access to affordable and secure housing."},{"instruction":"Summarize: You can avoid the leftover grease problem altogether by cooking your bacon in the oven.

As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's landholding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizencommoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.

Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or longdogs), such as greyhounds, may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink. Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.

The raw materials for laboratoryscale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used.

Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and remelting the first melt.

This structure has been prevalent in Western societies since the 1950s and has continued to be the dominant household type in many developed countries. However, in recent years there has been an increase in non-traditional households. These include single-parent households, cohabiting couples, and multi-generational households, where multiple generations of the same family live together under one roof. Single-parent households have become more common due to a rise in divorce rates and the increasing number of children born outside of marriage. Cohabiting couples are becoming more prevalent as well, with many people opting to live together before getting married, or choosing not to get married at all. Multi-generational households are also on the rise, as more elderly parents move in with their adult children due to economic or health reasons. This type of household can also be seen in many cultures where it is customary for the extended family to live together. Overall, while the nuclear family remains the most common household type, the trend towards non-traditional households is growing.

It is not clear why the couple hugged in court, but it was apparent that they had disrespected the solemnity of the proceedings. The judge's rebuke was a clear indication that the court takes its decorum seriously. Contempt of court is a serious offense that can lead to imprisonment or other legal penalties. It encompasses any behavior that obstructs or interferes with the administration of justice, such as refusing to obey a court order, disrupting court proceedings, or showing disrespect to the court. It is understandable why Judge Byers was not impressed with the couple's behavior. Courtrooms are places of formal decorum where the dignity of the law is upheld. Any behavior that undermines that principle is unacceptable. The judge's remark, 'I hope it was worth it,' was a reminder to the couple that their frivolous behavior had consequences. It was also an indication that contempt of court was not something to be taken lightly. In conclusion, Paine and Shaw's embrace may have seemed innocuous, but it violated the decorum of the court. The judge's stern rebuke was a reminder that the court takes such behavior seriously, and that contempt of court is a punishable offense.

They were able to score a field goal with just over seven minutes left on the clock, giving them a 10-3 lead over the Rams. The Rams were not able to recover, and the Patriots were able to hold onto their lead for the rest of the game, ultimately winning their sixth Super Bowl title. While this was an impressive feat by the Patriots, it was a disappointing end to the game for the Rams, as they were not able to mount a comeback and were shut out in the final quarter. However, they had several opportunities throughout the game to score, and their inability to capitalize on those opportunities ultimately led to their defeat.

The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles. Of the many silicabased glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called sodalime glass, composed of approximately 75% silicon dioxide (SiO2), sodium oxide (Na2O) from sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium oxide, also called lime (CaO), and several minor additives.

Despite the numerous treatment options available, the relapse rates can be alarmingly high ranging from 60% to 90% in the first year of sobriety. However, promising preclinical studies have shown that exercise has the potential to prevent and treat addiction. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in 2008 pledged 4 million towards researching the effects of exercise on addiction. The results of these studies indicated that exercise not only helps with physical health but also showed improvements in mental health and overall well-being. Scientists suggest that exercise promotes the production of endorphins, which are natural chemicals that elevate mood and can reduce the cravings experienced in addiction. Top 10 CNN Hero Scott Strode based his sober support group on exercise and sports. Strode understood the importance of finding a sense of purpose through physical activity, which helps individuals struggling with addiction to focus their energy on healthy activities instead of substance abuse. Through his group, Strode has had a significant impact on helping individuals struggling with addiction find long-term sobriety through exercise, sports, and a sense of community.

Sometimes, people can be shy or not sure about their feelings, making it hard to know where you stand. However, there are some signs you can look out for that may indicate that he's into you. By observing his body language and actions, you may be able to gauge whether or not he's really into you. One thing to watch for is when he goes out of his way for you. Does he seem willing to go out of his way to accommodate your needs or wants? Does he treat you differently than he treats his friends or other girls? Does he seem interested in the people you spend time with, such as your friends? If so, it may mean that he's more invested in your relationship than just a casual acquaintance. It's also important to notice if he wants you to meet his friends. If he's proud of you and wants to show you off to his circle, it can be a good sign. Additionally, if he's always doing you favors or ends up by your side in group settings, it may mean that he enjoys spending time with you and wants to make sure you're comfortable. Another factor to consider is how he acts around other girls. Does he only have eyes for you, or does he seem distracted by other females? While it's natural to notice other people, if he's always flirting or seeking attention from other girls, it may indicate that he's not as into you as you thought. When you're apart, pay attention to the types of things he does. Does he text you or call you just to say hi or to check in? Does he remember important details about your life and bring them up in conversation? These are all signs that he's paying attention and cares about you. Of course, it's also important to look at how you act together. Does he try to impress you or make you laugh? Does he act nervous around you or preen when you're around? Does he go out of his way to do things he knows you'll enjoy? These actions may indicate that he's trying to impress you and gain your attention. Finally, notice if you catch him looking at you. If he seems to gaze into your eyes or stare at you from across the room, it may mean that he's interested in you. Additionally, if he laughs extra hard around you or seems to get nervous in your presence, these could also be good signs that he's attracted to you. Overall, paying attention to his body language and actions can be an excellent way to tell if he's really into you or not.

Alan KnottCraig recently stepped down as CEO. He describes mobile as a revolution in Africa. You can build a big global tech company out of Africa, he says.","output":"Mxit: A Revolution in African Mobile Mxit, South Africa's most popular social media platform, has recently gone through a leadership transition. CEO Alan Knott-Craig has stepped down, but his enthusiasm for mobile technology and its potential in Africa has not waned. Knott-Craig firmly believes that mobile is a \\"revolution\\" in Africa, and he sees the potential for a \\"big global tech company\\" to emerge from the continent. Mxit is a mobile social networking application that has gained massive popularity in South Africa, and is now spreading to other African countries such as Nigeria and Kenya. In a region where smartphones are still relatively expensive and mobile data is costly, Mxit provides a platform for users to connect with others through basic mobile devices. Through Mxit, users can exchange messages, join chat groups, and access various services such as news, entertainment and education. Under Knott-Craig's leadership, Mxit has transformed from a simple mobile chat application to a comprehensive platform that offers a wide range of services. The company has also expanded its reach to other African countries, with a focus on providing basic mobile services to those who are not yet part of the smartphone revolution. Despite his departure from Mxit, Knott-Craig remains a strong advocate for mobile technology in Africa. He believes that the continent has a vast untapped potential for innovation, and that mobile technology is the key to unlocking this potential. He sees the rise of mobile as a game-changer for Africa's economic and social development, and urges entrepreneurs to seize the opportunities presented by the mobile revolution. In conclusion, Mxit may be just one example of the impact that mobile technology is having in Africa. Nevertheless, it is a powerful illustration of the potential of mobile to connect people and transform lives. With leaders like Knott-Craig advocating for the power of mobile in Africa, the continent may indeed be on the cusp of a new era of innovation and growth."},{"instruction":"f Three Asian girls sitting on a bench., does it logically follow that The girls are standing in the lobby of the hotel.?

Previous theories thought that chemicals caused the lips to tingle. Researchers admit it's unclear how that peppers access the sensors. Findings could help determine how taste changes between people.","output":"A Study on Spiciness: Sichuan Peppers and Lip Tingling Sichuan peppers are notorious for their spicy flavor, but recent studies have shown that they do more than just activate taste buds. It turns out that these spicy peppers can also activate touch sensors in the lips, causing a characteristic tingling sensation. This finding challenges previous theories that attributed the spiciness of Sichuan peppers to chemical irritation alone. Researchers have long known that spicy foods can cause sensations in the mouth and throat, but the exact mechanisms behind these sensations are still not fully understood. Some believed that chemicals in spicy foods, such as capsaicin in chili peppers, interact with receptors on pain-sensing nerve cells to create a burning or stinging sensation. Others suggested that spiciness was an illusion caused by the release of endorphins, which can create a pleasurable feeling that masks the pain. However, the discovery that Sichuan peppers can activate touch sensors in the lips suggests a different mechanism for spiciness. When the peppers are eaten or applied to the lips, they stimulate a particular type of sensory neuron that responds to touch. This activation can cause a tingling or buzzing sensation that is distinct from the burning or stinging of capsaicin. Despite this breakthrough, researchers admit that they still don't fully understand how Sichuan peppers access these touch sensors. It's possible that there is a chemical component that interacts with the neurons, but it's also possible that the mechanical action of the peppers on the lips is enough to stimulate the neurons. This new understanding of Sichuan peppers and lip tingling could have broader implications for understanding taste and sensory perception. By studying how different spices and flavors affect touch sensors in the mouth, researchers may be able to better understand how taste changes between people. This could lead to personalized diets and treatments for people with taste-related disorders. In conclusion, the discovery that Sichuan peppers activate touch sensors in the lips adds a new dimension to our understanding of spiciness. While the exact mechanisms are still unclear, this finding highlights the complex interactions between flavor, touch, and sensation in the mouth."},{"instruction":"Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: The main vegetable you must buy for guacomole is OPTIONS: Carrot Avocado","output":"Avocado."},{"instruction":"Answer based on context: Coming off their win at Kansas City, the Broncos returned home for an AFC duel against the New York Jets on Thursday Night Football.

However, simply feeling the beat isn't always enough to achieve a tight and precise performance. It's important to not only know your rhythms, but also measure them and determine the time signature. Measuring your rhythms can involve physically tapping out the beat or counting the duration of notes. This can help ensure that everyone in the ensemble is playing at the same tempo and that there are no discrepancies in timing. Determining the time signature - or the number of beats in each measure and the type of note that lasts a full beat - gives a framework for a consistent and structured rhythm. Communication is also key in achieving a strong sense of rhythm. Making sure everyone is on the same page and using consistent terminology can help prevent confusion and errors in timing. Using a metronome can also be a helpful tool for staying on track and keeping everyone in sync. By taking the time to measure your rhythms and determine the time signature, you can refine your performance and create a more cohesive and polished sound. Don't be afraid to use your words and a metronome to help achieve a strong sense of rhythm and timing."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: And in order to thank all the uses support and also as a return DLL Suite introduced this Free Download Service to help millions of PC users suffering from DLL errors like IMJPDSVREXE","output":"\\"And in order to thank all the users' support, and also as a return, DLL Suite introduced this Free Download Service to help millions of PC users suffering from DLL errors like IMJPDSVREXE.\\""},{"instruction":"Sentence: Gram flour and vegetables are main ingredients in bhajji which originates in India.
