Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorlycreated character in an illfated movie, thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random survival events (including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie (and what a nightmare it is!). Furthermore, despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film, there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded. All in all, a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to, much less innocent kids.

While households are important demographic information that is collected in the census, the focus is primarily on the individuals who make up those households. The census is a vital tool for governments and other organizations to plan for infrastructure, allocate resources, and provide services to the public. Some of the key data that the census collects includes age, gender, race, education level, and income. All of this information is used to better understand the needs of different communities and to make informed decisions about how to allocate resources. While household data is certainly useful, it is not the primary focus of the census. In fact, households are often reported alongside population data to give a more complete picture of the demographics of a certain area. This means that while households may be larger or smaller than populations in certain areas, the overall trend is that total population numbers are larger than total household numbers. It is also worth noting that the definitions of households and populations can vary depending on who is doing the counting. For example, a household may be defined as a group of people living together in one physical dwelling, while a population may include individuals who live alone, as well as those who live with others but in separate dwellings. In conclusion, while household data is important in the context of the census and society at large, the group that is typically larger according to census data is the population of people. This information is crucial for making informed decisions about how to allocate resources and plan for the needs of different communities."},{"instruction":"On a scale from 05, where 0 is not similar and 5 is very similar, how similar is the sentence Birthday of DPRK to Be Celebrated in Peru to the sentence Curiosity Rover Celebrates 1 Year on Mars?

However, when comparing poverty rates by age group, there is a clear disparity between those under the age of 18 and those aged 65 or over. According to the United States Census Bureau, the poverty rate for children under the age of 18 was 16.2% in 2019, representing approximately 11.9 million children living below the poverty line. In comparison, the poverty rate for those aged 65 and over was 9.2%, or approximately 4.5 million individuals. While both age groups experience poverty, children under the age of 18 are overrepresented in poverty when compared to their share in the total population. In 2019, children under the age of 18 made up 22.3% of the population but accounted for 31.1% of those in poverty. On the other hand, those aged 65 and over made up 16.5% of the population but only represented 8.7% of those in poverty. One of the main reasons for this disparity is the difference in access to social security benefits. Those 65 and over are eligible to receive social security benefits to supplement their retirement income, whereas young children do not have access to any additional income support programs. Additionally, families with children may face more financial burdens, such as child care and educational expenses, that can push them into poverty. Overall, while both age groups experience poverty, children under the age of 18 are more likely to live in poverty compared to those aged 65 or over. Addressing child poverty through policies that provide income support, education, and access to quality health care is crucial to ensuring that all children have a fair shot at success."},{"instruction":"Article: The only technical university in Mauritius is the University of Technology, Mauritius with its main campus situated in La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables.

The elephant, believed to have been caught in a current while crossing a stretch of water separating two areas of jungle near the town of Kokkilai, was spotted trying to keep its trunk above the waves some 10 miles off the northeast coast of Sri Lanka on Tuesday. The Navy and Department of Wildlife officials then jumped into action. Over 12 hours, rescuers tied the elephant with ropes and slowly pulled it to shallow waters, reports the Guardian. A rep for a conservation group says elephants are very good swimmers who are known to travel between local islands; they may have even first reached Sri Lanka after swimming from southern India. But while it's not unusual to see elephants paddling 10 miles off shore, they can't keep swimming for long because they burn a lot of energy, the rep says, adding, in this case, the situation probably warranted human intervention. A video of the rescue shows the elephant barely staying afloat before it was pulled ashore and put in the care of wildlife officials, per the Sunday Times.

However, it’s important to approach the tanning process with caution to avoid skin damage and burns. If you’re new to tanning or want to ensure that you’re doing it correctly, here are some tips to keep in mind. 1. Consult a Staff Member: Before using a tanning bed, it’s important to speak to someone on staff who can guide you through the process. They can explain how the bed works, answer any questions you might have, and provide tips specific to your skin type. 2. Check the Countdown Timer: Every tanning bed should have a countdown timer that lets you know how much time is left in your session. Make sure you know where it is and check it periodically throughout your tan to ensure that you don’t overexpose your skin. 3. Position Yourself Correctly: When you lie in a tanning bed, it’s important to position yourself correctly to avoid tan lines and ensure an even glow. Lay on your back inside the bed with your arms and legs spread, and bend your knees slightly to avoid tan lines on the back of your upper thighs. Halfway through the tanning session, flip onto your stomach and rotate your body onto your side to ensure a full, even tan. 4. Wait Before Bathing: After your tanning session, it’s important to wait at least 3 to 4 hours before taking a shower or bathing. This will give your skin time to set the tan. 5. Maintain Your Tan: Tanning beds can be addictive, but it’s important to avoid overexposure, which can damage your skin. If you want to maintain your tan, consider revisiting the salon once a week or using tan extenders at home.

Tip #2: Don’t Rehearse Too Much Over-practicing your delivery may lead to an overly rehearsed and robotic conversation. While it is good to prepare for the conversation at hand, you also want to leave some room for spontaneity and natural communication. Focus on your main points, but allow your natural personality to shine through. Tip #3: Know Your Intentions Be clear on why you are engaging in conversation. Knowing your intentions can help you be more direct and maintain a clear focus. Additionally, it will prevent the conversation from veering off-topic and get you what you need from the interaction. Tip #4: Be Prepared for Conversation Preparing your points beforehand can be beneficial. You’ll have an idea of what to say and not feel pressured into having to search for words. Additionally, take into consideration the context of the conversation to be better equipped with what points to touch upon. Tip #5: Don’t Stalk Them Stalking or overanalyzing social media profiles and interactions on personal or professional connections can lead to the removal of natural and free-flowing conversations. Before a conversation takes place, practice avoiding and ignoring anything you may have seen on social media in regards to the person you’re talking with. By implementing these tips, you’re well on your way to becoming a more effective communicator. Remember to be confident, clear and concise, and know your intentions for any conversation."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: PleasenotehoweverthattheCommissioncannotofferadviceaboutthenationalproceduresavailableinindividualcases.","output":"Please note, however, that the Commission cannot offer advice about the national procedures available in individual cases."},{"instruction":"Tweet: @JonathanRKnight Love you!

Some species have minute eyes that are unfit for identifying females, while others have underdeveloped nostrils, making them unlikely to effectively find females by smell. When a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the bloodvessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to freeliving males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.

The tensions seem to have arisen due to an ongoing dispute between the workers and the factory owners over wages and working conditions. Reports from the scene suggest that the situation was severe, and the police had to use force to disperse the crowd. The clashes have been reported as intense, and the workers' frustration has been evident. Bangladesh's government has tried to address the concerns of the workers, but it seems that many are still unhappy with the conditions in which they work. There have been calls for change, but the response from the authorities has not been satisfactory. The situation was so critical that a cabinet minister called on the protesters to exercise restraint. The minister highlighted the importance of peace in the country and urged workers not to resort to violence. She reassured them that the government was working to improve their conditions and that violent behavior would not be tolerated. The ongoing violence and unrest in the Bangladeshi garment industry reveal a breakdown in communication between workers and factory owners. Workers are asking for their wages to be increased, and they want better working conditions. Unfortunately, their concerns have gone unheeded for a long time, leading to this kind of unrest. It is essential that the government and factory owners take steps to address the concerns of the workers. They should work together to ensure that the workers' demands are met in a manner that promotes peace and security in the country. The workers' cause is not just, and their demands should not be ignored. In conclusion, the clashes between the Bangladeshi garment workers and police are the latest example of long-standing tensions between the workers and the factory owners. The government should work to address the workers' concerns and create a peaceful environment for everyone involved. Violence should never be the answer, and it is crucial for all parties to work together to find a solution."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to protect your facebook account from hackers Create a strong password.

You can then use a hammer to pound the anchor into place until it is flush with the surface of the wood.

Determine the deck height in centimeters. Figure out the piston top volume in cubic centimeters. Measure the head gasket volume in cubic centimeters. Determine the combustion chamber volume in cubic centimeters.","output":"If you are an auto enthusiast or a mechanic, you must be familiar with the various components that make up an engine. One of the essential aspects of an engine is its piston, which goes up and down in the cylinder bore to generate power. To ensure optimal engine performance, you must have accurate measurements of a few crucial components in the engine. In this article, we'll cover the key steps to take to measure the bore, stroke, deck height, piston top volume, head gasket volume, and combustion chamber volume. The first step is to measure the bore in centimeters. Bore refers to the diameter of the cylinder where the piston moves up and down. You can use a bore gauge to measure the bore accurately. Next, you need to find the stroke in centimeters. The stroke refers to the distance travel by the piston as it moves from top to bottom. This measurement is significant because it determines the engine's displacement, which plays a critical role in engine performance. After determining the stroke, you need to determine the deck height in centimeters. Deck height refers to the distance between the top of the block and the piston crown when the piston is at top dead center (TDC). You can measure this distance by subtracting the piston's compression height from the block height. The next step is to figure out the piston top volume in cubic centimeters. Piston top volume refers to the amount of clearance between the piston head and the cylinder head when the piston is at TDC. To measure this volume, you need to determine the effective head volume of the piston. Once you have the piston top volume, you need to measure the head gasket volume in cubic centimeters. The head gasket plays a vital role in the engine by sealing the combustion chamber, ensuring that compressed gas does not escape. You can measure this volume by using a micrometer and calculating the thickness and area of the gasket. Finally, you need to determine the combustion chamber volume in cubic centimeters. The combustion chamber is the part of the engine where the fuel-air mixture is compressed and ignited. To measure this volume, you need to measure the volume of the cylinder head that protrudes into the cylinder bore. You can use a precision tool to measure this volume accurately. In conclusion, accurate measurements of engine components are crucial for optimal engine performance. To measure the bore, stroke, deck height, piston top volume, head gasket volume, and combustion chamber volume, you need precise and accurate tools. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that your engine is in top condition and performing at its best."},{"instruction":"Jo, I left you a voice mail, but being an email addict I thought I would send you a note as well.

Prosecutors have one more shot with a new jury to secure a death sentence. Otherwise, Arias faces life in prison. Arias' attorneys portrayed her as a naive woman in love with a sexual deviant.","output":"Jodi Arias' defense attorneys made a controversial move in court when they sought to portray the victim, Travis Alexander, as a man torn between his religious beliefs and his sexual desires. This strategy was employed in an attempt to persuade the jury to spare Arias of a death sentence. Arias was convicted for the murder of Alexander, her former boyfriend, in 2013. Prosecutors are seeking another trial to secure a death sentence for Arias. If they fail, she will face a life in prison. The defense attorneys are aware of the gravity of the situation, and they have resorted to portraying their client as a naive woman who was in love with a sexual deviant. The case has drawn much attention and controversy, with many people questioning the defense's strategy to vilify the victim instead of focusing on Arias' actions. Some have accused the defense of victim-blaming and perpetuating harmful stereotypes about sexual behavior. Despite the backlash, the defense has continued with their strategy, arguing that Alexander's promiscuous behavior contributed to the events leading up to his murder. They have also presented evidence of Alexander's supposed interest in BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism, and masochism), citing this as a possible reason for the violent encounter with Arias. The defense's portrayal of Alexander has caused much debate, with some arguing that it is irrelevant and disrespectful to the victim and his family. However, some believe that it is a valid defense strategy that highlights the complexities of the relationship between Arias and Alexander. Whatever the outcome of the trial may be, the controversy surrounding the case has shed light on the difficulties that victims of abuse and sexual deviance often face. The debate surrounding this case raises important questions about how we perceive sex, relationships, and consent. It serves as a reminder that justice is rarely black and white, and that the complexities of human behavior and relationships make it difficult to arrive at a clear verdict."},{"instruction":"Sentence: He has danced.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The \\"Fifty Shades\\" franchise has been making headlines again as it was reported that a new Christian Grey actor is still being considered. With rumors swirling around who could potentially replace Jamie Dornan in the leading role, writer and director Oliver Stone recently made a surprising recommendation: Leonardo DiCaprio. Stone expressed his choice for DiCaprio in a recent interview, suggesting that the actor would be a fitting match for the complex character of Christian Grey. Fans of the franchise may be surprised by this suggestion, as DiCaprio is not typically known for starring in erotic dramas. However, Stone believes that DiCaprio's range as an actor could make him the perfect fit. This isn't the first time that DiCaprio has been suggested for the role of Grey. In fact, his name has been tossed around since the first \\"Fifty Shades\\" film was in production. However, the actor has never publicly commented on the rumors. Whether or not DiCaprio ultimately lands the role, it's clear that there is a high level of anticipation surrounding the upcoming film. The \\"Fifty Shades\\" franchise has been a massive success since the release of the first book in 2011, and fans have been eagerly anticipating a new Christian Grey since Dornan's departure. As the search for a new leading man continues, fans can only speculate who will end up landing the coveted role.

The report reveals that children with special educational needs are nine times more likely to be excluded from school than their peers without special needs. This disparity in exclusion rates is particularly worrying, as children with special needs require additional support and understanding from their teachers and school communities. Instead, they are being left behind and left out of the classroom, which can have devastating effects on their education and wellbeing. The report also uncovered a gender gap, as boys are three times more likely to be expelled from school than girls. This suggests that there may be underlying issues within schools and society as a whole that are causing boys to struggle in the education system. It is important that we address these disparities and ensure that all children are given equal opportunities to succeed in their education. We must provide additional support and resources for children with special needs and work to understand and address the underlying issues that contribute to the gender gap in exclusion rates. By supporting and uplifting all children in the education system, we can create a fairer and more just society, one in which every child has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = The Punter, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, priceRange = cheap, customer rating = average, familyFriendly = yes, near = Café Sicilia.

Next, you may need to copy files from your location to the remote computer. You can do this using the \\"scp\\" command. It's important to pay attention to the file paths, as they will determine where the file is copied to. Copying files through the shell can also be done using the \\"cp\\" command. This allows you to make copies of files within the same directory or to a different directory altogether. To move or rename files, use the \\"mv\\" command. If you need to delete files or directories, use the \\"rm\\" or \\"rmdir\\" commands, respectively. However, be cautious when using these commands, as once a file or directory is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Changing permissions for your files can be done using the \\"chmod\\" command. This allows you to control who can access and edit your files. It's important to understand the different permission levels, such as read, write, and execute. Finally, take the time to learn the other assorted basic commands, such as \\"pwd\\" for displaying the current working directory, \\"clear\\" for clearing the screen, and \\"history\\" for showing a list of previously executed commands.

But when they got closer, they found a tide of foulsmelling brown sludge. Payouts look unlikely after lorry and waste firms each blamed the other.","output":"Eyewitnesses in Hechi city were in for a shock when they approached what they initially thought was a car accident. As they got closer, they came across a tide of brown sludge with a foul odor. It was an unpleasant sight, and concerns quickly arose about the potential ecological impact. The source of the sludge was soon discovered to be a lorry carrying waste. Naturally, legal action was taken, and the waste firm and lorry company were blamed for the incident. The big question, of course, was who was going to compensate the victims of this environmental disaster? Unfortunately, it seems that payouts are unlikely. Both the lorry and waste firms have been pointing fingers at each other, essentially claiming that they were not responsible for the spillage. With no clear evidence pointing one way or the other, the case appears to be at a standstill. This case highlights a problem that many communities face when it comes to environmental disasters - the fact that it can be almost impossible to get compensation when nobody is willing to take responsibility. The people affected by this sludge spill will be left to pick up the pieces while the two companies involved continue to deny any wrongdoing. It's important that companies take responsibility for their actions, especially when their actions could potentially harm the environment or people's health. In cases like this, proving who is at fault can be difficult, but it's important that measures are put in place to prevent such accidents from happening in the future. In conclusion, the brown sludge spill in Hechi city has been a source of concern for many. The failure of the waste firm and lorry company to take responsibility for the incident means that victims may never receive compensation. This highlights the need for companies to take their environmental responsibilities seriously, and for better measures to be put in place to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? punching up the mix OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"positive"},{"instruction":"Please add spaces between words: PixwordsTheimagewithcart,mine,iron,train,old,rustClearviewstock","output":"Pixwords The image with cart, mine, iron, train, old, rust.

Whether it's caused by sitting for long hours, lifting heavy objects, or exercising excessively, back pain can be excruciating and disrupt your daily life. Fortunately, there are ways to alleviate back pain and soothe sore muscles without the need for medication. In this article, we'll discuss some of the best tips and tricks to help you relieve back pain. Use a Cold Compress One of the most effective ways to reduce pain and inflammation is by applying a cold compress to the affected area. A cold compress can help numb the pain and reduce swelling. Use a cold compress for 20 minutes at a time, and avoid applying it directly to your skin to prevent ice burns. Use Heat for Chronic Pain If your back pain is chronic, you may prefer to use heat to ease your discomfort. Heat can help increase blood flow and relax muscles. Apply heat after 2 days of using cold compresses if you prefer it. You should not use heat during the first 48 hours following an injury, as it can worsen inflammation. Relax If your back hurts when you move, try to avoid any strenuous activity to give your back a break. Relax and let your body heal. You may need to take a few days off work or reduce the amount of time you spend exercising until your pain subsides. Use a Lidocaine Patch or Capsaicin Ointment Another way to ease muscle pain is by applying a lidocaine patch or capsaicin ointment to your back. A lidocaine patch can provide numbing relief to your muscles, while capsaicin can provide a warming sensation that can alleviate pain. Both of these options can be found at your local pharmacy and are available over-the-counter. Try Some Honey Honey has natural anti-inflammatory and healing properties, making it perfect for soothing sore muscles. Try rubbing some honey over your back and covering it with cloth to help reduce pain and inflammation. It's an all-natural and inexpensive solution to back pain. Massage Your Muscles Getting a gentle massage can help relax your muscles and ease your back pain. Try to find a reputable clinic that offers massage services or ask a licensed massage therapist for a referral. A massage can also help improve your overall mood and reduce stress. Try Acupuncture Acupuncture is an excellent alternative therapy to relieve back pain. This ancient Chinese practice involves inserting thin needles into specific points in your body to help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. You should sign up for acupuncture at a reputable clinic to ensure the best results. Avoid Arnica, Acetaminophen, and Herbs If you're looking for a natural solution to your back pain, it's essential to avoid certain herbs and supplements as they can cause adverse effects. For example, arnica can cause skin irritation and acetaminophen can damage your liver when taken in large doses. Always consult your doctor before taking any supplements. In conclusion, back pain can be a real pain, but with these tips and tricks, you can alleviate your discomfort and soothe sore muscles without relying on medication. Remember to always consult with your doctor if you experience severe or chronic pain."},{"instruction":"Towing<br>Last week we saw a police car in front of a parked car.

While this diagnosis can be daunting for many families, Skyler's parents decided to take a supportive role in their child's life. They recognized the importance of allowing Skyler to live authentically and fully embrace her true self. This meant allowing her to transition from male to female, with the parents supporting her every step of the way. As Skyler approached the age of eleven, her medical team advised her to start taking medication to block puberty. This is a crucial step in a young transgender person's journey, as it allows them time to explore their gender identity and make informed decisions about any future medical interventions. Skyler's parents have found it challenging at times, as they navigate the societal pressures surrounding gender and identity. However, they remain committed to providing Skyler with a nurturing and accepting environment, where her emotional well-being and physical safety are their top priority. For Skyler, it has finally allowed her to feel a sense of comfort in her own skin. She is now able to express herself genuinely, without fear of judgement or rejection. Her journey has also taught her that authenticity and self-love should always be cherished and nurtured, regardless of our differences.

The argument for removal states that dewclaws are a weak digit, barely attached to the leg, and thus they can rip partway off or easily catch on something and break, which can be painful and prone to infection. Dewclaw removal is most easily performed when the dog is young, around 25 days of age. It can also be performed on older dogs if necessary though the surgery may be more difficult then. The surgery is fairly straightforward and may be done with local anesthetics if the digit is not well connected to the leg.

If you're new to wakeboarding, it's important to start off on the right foot (or board!) to ensure a fun and safe experience. Here are some essential tips to consider: 1. Rent or buy a beginner's wakeboard: Don't invest in an expensive wakeboard until you've had some experience. Rent or buy a beginner's board, which is typically wider and more stable than advanced boards, and easier to control. 2. Get a pair of wakeboarding boots: Wakeboarding boots are specifically designed to keep your feet secure to the board, and offer more support than traditional open-toe water ski boots. 3. Talk to the boat driver: The boat driver is responsible for maintaining a safe speed and direction for the wakeboarder. Communicate with them before you start to ensure you're both on the same page. 4. Designate someone to be the spotter: The spotter is responsible for keeping an eye on the wakeboarder and alerting the boat driver if they fall or require assistance. 5. Decide which foot you want to face forward: In wakeboarding, your stance will either be regular or goofy, depending on which foot you choose to face forward. Experiment to see which feels most natural for you. 6. Put on a life jacket before you get in the water: A life jacket is a necessary safety precaution for any water sport, especially for beginners. Make sure it fits snugly and doesn't ride up on your body. 7. Use a short rope during your first few tows: A shorter rope will keep you closer to the boat and allow for easier control until you get the hang of things. Gradually lengthen the rope as you improve.

Arad was an Israeli historian who dedicated his career to studying the Holocaust and the atrocities committed against the Jewish people. In his book \\"Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps,\\" Arad estimates that approximately 1.5 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust in the Operation Reinhard death camps alone. However, when it comes to the Jewish uprising specifically, Arad's estimates are lower than some of his peers. The Jewish uprising, also known as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, took place in the Warsaw Ghetto in April 1943. It was an act of rebellion against the Nazis who were deporting Jews from the ghetto to concentration camps. Arad's estimate for the number of Jews killed during the uprising is around 6,000, which is the second lowest estimate among Holocaust scholars. The lowest estimate comes from Israeli historian Shmuel Krakowski, who puts the number at around 2,000. Arad's estimate is based on a variety of sources, including survivor testimonies, historical records, and other accounts of the uprising. While some historians have argued that the number could be higher, Arad's estimate is widely accepted as being one of the most accurate. It's important to remember that behind every estimate of the number of Jews killed during the Holocaust are individual stories of tragedy and loss.

The key to staying warm and stylish during the winter season is to layer, layer, layer. But layering isn't just about adding more clothes; it's about combining different pieces to create a complete look that is both fashionable and functional. First, start with a basic jacket. This is the foundation of your winter wardrobe, and you should choose a style that is both versatile and practical. A classic denim or leather jacket is always a good choice because they are timeless, and they go with almost everything. A bomber jacket is also a great option for a more casual look. If you want to add some sophistication to your outfit, try a cape. It's an elegant and chic way to stay warm and cozy. Capes come in a variety of materials, but wool or cashmere are best for the winter months as they provide excellent insulation. A black or gray cape is a classic choice that will never go out of style. To keep your neck warm, add a scarf or faux fur to your outfit. A scarf is a great way to add color and texture to your outfit, while a faux fur will keep you extra cozy and add a touch of glamour to your look. If you're feeling daring, try a bold-colored scarf, like red or green, to make a statement. Finally, layer a shirt underneath your jacket or cape. A simple white or black shirt is always a safe choice, but you can also experiment with patterns or prints. Plaid or checked shirts look great with denim jackets, while striped shirts add a touch of elegance to a cape. In conclusion, staying warm and fashionable during the winter season is all about layering. Start with a basic jacket, add a stylish cape, accessorize with a scarf or faux fur, and finish by layering a shirt underneath. With these tips, you can create a variety of outfits that will keep you looking stylish and cozy all winter long."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this Put the system repair CD or DVD into the optical drive.

Dr. Hilary led the examination with the help of a young volunteer named Charlie, who followed his instructions. The aim of the examination was to encourage young men to check their testicles and help detect any signs of testicular cancer early. However, some viewers found the close-up shots of the man's scrotum distasteful and expressed their discomfort on social media. It's important to note that while the demonstration may have been uncomfortable for some viewers to watch, it served a crucial purpose. Testicular cancer is a serious disease, and early detection can be the key to saving someone's life.

Know the different types of bourbon and their specific flavors.","output":"Bourbon is a popular American whiskey that has been enjoyed by many for generations. However, not everyone knows the basic standards that each batch of bourbon must meet in order to be considered true bourbon. In this article, we will explore the different aspects of bourbon that you should know about, such as its age, color, history, and types. First and foremost, it's important to understand the basic standards that each batch of bourbon must meet. To be considered bourbon, it must be made from at least 51% corn and aged in brand new, charred oak barrels. It must also be distilled to no more than 80% alcohol by volume and aged for a minimum of two years. These are the basic standards that every bourbon must meet, so it's important to keep an eye out for these requirements when choosing a bourbon to try. Another important factor to consider when choosing a bourbon is its age. While bourbons can technically be aged for as little as two years, most experts agree that the best bourbons are aged for at least four years or more. This allows the bourbon to develop a more complex flavor profile and gives it a smoother finish. When choosing a bourbon, look for one that has hit the right age to ensure that you are getting a high-quality product. In addition to age, it's also important to recognize the different colors of bourbon. Bourbon can range from a light straw color to a deep amber, depending on its age and the type of barrel it was aged in. These colors can give you an idea of what to expect in terms of flavor and aroma. For example, a light-colored bourbon may have a lighter, sweeter flavor, while a darker bourbon may have a more complex, oaky flavor. Learning about the history of bourbon is also important for any bourbon enthusiast. Bourbon has a rich history that dates back to the 1700s, when it was first distilled by early American settlers. Today, bourbon is still made in much the same way it was hundreds of years ago, with many distilleries using traditional methods to give their bourbon a unique flavor. Finally, it's important to know the different types of bourbon and their specific flavors. There are several different types of bourbon, such as high-rye bourbon, wheated bourbon, and straight bourbon. Each type has a unique flavor profile and can be paired with different foods or enjoyed on its own. In conclusion, knowing the basic standards of bourbon, understanding its age, recognizing its colors, learning about its history, and knowing the different types and flavors are all important aspects of becoming a bourbon enthusiast. With this knowledge in mind, you can confidently explore the wonderful world of bourbon and find the perfect bottle to suit your tastes."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: In the past efforts were made to establish sanity with inkblots square blocks and tests with marbles to find out if anybody had lost any","output":"In the past, efforts were made to establish sanity with inkblots, square blocks, and tests with marbles to find out if anybody had lost any."},{"instruction":"ploughman’s lunch with british cheese, an apple, seasonal fruits and berries, seasonal salad, piccalilli, mango chutney and a chunk of good bread and butter Write the above sentence using proper case.","output":"Ploughman’s lunch with British cheese, an apple, seasonal fruits and berries, seasonal salad, piccalilli, mango chutney, and a chunk of good bread and butter."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

NavyAir Force was allowed to go forward because it involved all nonbudgeted funds.","output":"The ongoing government shutdown has affected numerous aspects of American life, including the operation of the nation's service academies. However, amidst the disarray, one longstanding tradition managed to continue - the annual football game between the Naval and Air Force Academies. This came as a surprise to some, given that the shutdown had initially threatened to derail the game. The Pentagon had announced that, due to the shutdown and the resulting lack of funding, all athletic competitions at service academies would be suspended indefinitely. However, the Navy-Air Force game was allowed to proceed as scheduled. Why was this game different? Simply put, it involved non-budgeted funds. The Navy and Air Force Academies had used funds from outside sources, such as private donations, to cover the costs associated with hosting the game. This allowed them to circumvent the restrictions imposed by the shutdown and put on a successful event, complete with flyovers and military pageantry. But what about future games? Unfortunately, it is unclear whether other service academy sports will be able to follow in the footsteps of the Navy and Air Force teams. The Pentagon has announced that all academy sports will be reviewed on a weekly basis, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis. This puts teams and fans alike in a precarious position. Without a clear directive on which games will be allowed to proceed, some teams may find it difficult to plan and prepare for upcoming seasons. Spectators may also be left in the dark, unsure whether their favorite teams will be able to take the field or court. Despite the uncertainty, there is hope that the situation will improve. Negotiations between lawmakers to end the shutdown are ongoing, and some have expressed optimism that a resolution may be reached soon.

The Earths crust is divided into plates. There are about a dozen large plates and several small ones. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Scientists know he plates are in motion. They now know the direction and speed of this motion . Plates dont move very fast. They move only a few centimeters a year.

However, it was actually North America where the British first established a military presence. In the early 17th century, England colonized Virginia, creating a foothold in what would later become the United States. From there, they expanded into other areas of North America, including the establishment of settlements in what is now Massachusetts and Maryland. These colonies had military units to protect against attacks from native peoples, but they were still relatively small and focused on self-defense. It wasn't until the mid-17th century that the British began focusing on the West Indies as a strategic location for military action. The islands provided access to valuable resources like sugar, but they were also vulnerable to attack by competing European powers. The British established military bases in the area, allowing them to defend their holdings and project power throughout the Caribbean. Despite this shift towards the West Indies, North America remained a crucial part of the British military strategy throughout the colonial period. The French and Indian War, which was fought primarily in North America between 1754 and 1763, was a pivotal moment for the British in their quest to cement their dominance in the region. They ultimately emerged victorious, solidifying their control over North America and paving the way for the American Revolution.

Shave in the direction that your hair grows.","output":"Keeping your skin smooth and silky after shaving requires more than just a sharp razor blade. Proper skin care before and after shaving can help prevent irritation, razor burn, and ingrown hairs. One important step in a good shaving routine is to wash often-shaved areas with warm water and moisturizing soap. This not only helps to remove dirt and bacteria that may have accumulated on the skin, but also softens the hair and prepares it for shaving. Before you start shaving, it’s also important to rinse the area you’ll be shaving with warm water. This helps to soften the hair and open up the hair follicles, making the hair easier to shave. It also helps to reduce irritation and prevents razor burn. Using a gentle, moisturizing soap or shaving cream can also help to lubricate the skin and reduce friction, minimizing the risk of nicks and cuts. When it comes time to shave, always remember to shave in the direction that your hair grows. Shaving against the grain can cause irritation, razor burn, and even ingrown hairs. Shaving in the direction of hair growth also helps to prevent razor bumps and other types of skin irritation. After you’ve finished shaving, rinse the area with cool water to close the pores and prevent bacteria from entering the skin. Pat the area dry with a clean towel, and apply a moisturizing lotion or oil to prevent dryness and keep your skin feeling soft and smooth. By incorporating these tips into your shaving routine, you can help keep your skin looking and feeling great. So go ahead and enjoy your silky smooth skin with a little extra care and attention to your skin care regimen."},{"instruction":"Write a negative movie review.","output":"Movie Review: \\"The Last Airbender\\" \\"The Last Airbender\\" is a film that should have never been made.

Consider the Occasion Firstly, think about the occasion or theme of your project. For example, if you are creating something for a wedding, you may want to opt for elegant ribbon in a soft hue and delicate beads. Alternatively, if you are creating a fun and playful project, bright and bold colors may be more appropriate. Think About the Material The material of your ribbon and beads plays a significant role in the overall look and feel of your project. Consider the texture, weight, and quality of the materials to ensure that they complement each other. You might want to use a thin, silky ribbon for a delicate project or a thicker, more substantial ribbon for added texture and dimension. Focus on the Colors Colors are an essential element of any craft project. Think about the colors you have already incorporated into your design and use your ribbon and beads to complement them. You may choose to use contrasting colors to create a pop of color, or you may opt for a color scheme to achieve a cohesive, polished look. Experiment with Different Styles Finally, don't be afraid to experiment with different ribbon and bead styles. You may want to try combining different textures, colors, or sizes to create a unique and eye-catching design. By exploring your options, you can find the perfect combination of ribbon and beads to elevate your next project. In conclusion, choosing the perfect ribbon and beads for your craft project can seem overwhelming, but with a little thought and consideration, you can achieve a beautiful and professional-looking result. By focusing on the occasion, material, colors, and experimenting with different styles, you can create a unique and stunning design that truly reflects your vision."},{"instruction":"w does the sentence end?

He joins a growing list of athletes who have come out as gay in recent years, including NBA player Jason Collins and Olympic diver Tom Daley. Thomas' decision to come out publicly is seen as an important milestone for the representation of LGBTQ+ people in sports. He has talked about the challenges he faced while hiding his sexuality, and how it impacted his mental health and well-being. By being open about who he is, Thomas hopes to inspire others to do the same. In an interview with BBC Sport, Thomas said, \\"I don't want to be known as a gay rugby player. I am a rugby player, first and foremost. But I want to be a role model. I want to be a beacon of hope for young people who are struggling with their identity.\\" Thomas has received an outpouring of support from fans and fellow athletes since his announcement. Many have praised him for his bravery and honesty, and for the positive impact he could have on breaking down barriers for LGBTQ+ individuals in sports.
