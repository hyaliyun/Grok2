And so on until Epilogue. #1 - Setup Dragonstone Castle, Rhaenyra is living here with her three sons and recently widowed Daemon. A day before her secret wedding to Daemon on Dragonstone Rhaenyra gets a letter from the capital from her father. He speaks of possibility of her trial and disinheritance after Corlys Velaryon’s demands and the manipulations of Otto Hightower. She learns that after his son Laenor’s recent funeral, lord Corlys publicly announces the bastardy of Rhaenyra's children before the Small Council and the king. Rhaenyra races to the capital with Daemon and her sons, dreading what awaits. Corlys and Rhaenys are in the capital too. Princess Rhaenys refuses to speak with either Daemon or Rhaenyra. Daemon tries to ask her for help but Rhaenys denies to listen to his ask. #2 - Turning Point #1 (10%) Inciting Incident King Viserys has no choice but disinherit Rhaenyra under the pressure of the revelations presented by Otto and Corlys (they use lord Larys Strong’s fabricated letters from Harwin to support the accusations). Otto insists on a public trial but Viserys refuses to humiliate his daughter further and decrees his decision to Rhaenyra and Daemon privately. In his decree Rhaenyra and her sons are exiled from Westeros until the end of Viserys’s reign. They lose all titles too (Rhaenyra and her sons are no longer princes). King Viserys legitimizes her sons Jace, Luke and Joffrey as Targaryens as the parting gift to his daughter. Prince Daemon loses a right to raise his daughters, as Corlys and Rhaenys demanded Baela and Rhaena to become their wards. Daemon is deeply offended and angry at them and at his brother. Humiliated and furious, Rhaenyra clashes with Otto, who relishes her fall. Lord Otto Hightower smugly demands to also take the ancestral sword, Darksister from Daemon but Daemon snarls at him and dares anyone to come and try to take it from him by force. Viserys I forbids the duel. Rhaenyra, Daemon and their children are escorted from the Red Keep. They are given 3 days to gather their things and leave the Westeros. Reaction to the Inciting Incident. Character processes, makes a decision, leads to some actions. Rhaenyra and Daemon, realizing the severity of their situation, gather their things from the Dragonstone castle, take the trusted maester Gerardys with them and move to Volantis, meet their relative princess Saera Targaryen and marry there. Saera accepts them in her palace, nobles of Volantis are glad to have a family of dragonriders in their city. Daemon becomes a honorable protector of Volantis. Over time, Rhaenyra accepts her fate while Daemon's ambition grows as he hears of unrest in the Stepstones. Rhaenyra gives birth to their son Aegon, giving them hope for the future. Soon after Aegon’s birth, Rhaenyra and Daemon overhear rumors of the chaos in the Stepstones, planting the seed for their kingdom-building plan. #3 Turning Point #2 (20-25%) – New Goal for the story Daemon’s ambition to become the “King of the Narrow Sea” again converges with Rhaenyra’s desire for safety and a home for her family. They decide to seize the opportunity to carve out a new kingdom amidst the Volantis war against pirates and make their stand in the Stepstones. Daemon and Rhaenyra establish a makeshift war council. Allies, mercenaries and resources are assessed, including seeking Saera’s help in Volantis. Meanwhile, Daemon trains Rhaenyra’s young sons Jace and Luke in combat and dragon riding, emphasizing their role in the future of their new kingdom. #4 - Pinch Point #1 (33% roughly) As they begin consolidating power in the Stepstones, Daemon counters an unexpected challenge: a fleet led by Corlys. It becomes clear that lord Corlys, too, seeks control of the main trade routes in the Narrow Sea and has his own designs on the islands. Daemon meets Velaryons, Corlys claims he wants to take these islands for himself. Daemon learns Corlys legitimized his two bastard sons and made Addam his heir. Daemon’s older daughter Baela is betrothed to Addam despite Rhaenys’ protests. Daemon learns Rhaena was reluctantly betrothed to her cousin Prince Daeron to strengthen royal ties. He curses Corlys’ greed and rejects further negotiations. Daemon brings Volantis’ army and fleet and forces Velaryons to retreat. Caraxes burns the largest ships of Corlys. All ties between Rhaenyra’s family and her Westerosi family are broken. #5 Character's reaction to the Pinch Point and/or first big step toward their goal. #6 – Twist #1 (Where something new and dark happens) Daemon and Rhaenyra endure a harrowing assassination attempt by remnants of the Triarchy and discover the covert involvement of Westerosi agents, revealing a far-reaching conspiracy against them. # 7 Characters acts based on that twist (the adjustment played out). Difficult question/request/statement is asked/made. Rhaenyra, shaken by the assassination attempt, orders a crackdown on security. Daemon leads a council meeting, discussing how to root out the spies and traitors within their midst. #8 A complication because of the adjustment. Pirates on the Stepstones launch a surprise offensive, emboldened by the chaos and discontent. Daemon and Rhaenyra work quickly to suppress the uprising. #9 – The Midpoint (50%) Aemond becomes the Hand of Aegon II, ratcheting up the tension between Westeros and Essos. Daemon gets information from his worried friends in Pentos and Volantis that Aemond lays plans to attack the Stepstones, inciting Daemon and Rhaenyra to start arranging political betrothals for her sons, showcasing the increasing gravity of the struggle for power and survival. #10 Regroup after the Midpoint, a decision made for new action. Aemond’s ambitions cause Rhaenyra to seek stronger ties with Essosi powers. Saera and Rhaenyra counsel one another on the political landscape of Essos, leading to the decision to arrange strategic betrothals for her sons. #11 A new complication and reaction. The gathering is sabotaged by Dornish spies, seeking to undermine Rhaenyra’s efforts and weaken her position for their benefit. Rhaenyra’s son, Lucerys, discovers a hidden correspondence which hints at Aemond’s plans, escalating his desire to protect his family and proving his worth. #12 – Pinch Point #2 (62% roughly) Rhaenyra’s former husband Laenor comes to the Stepstones after years of faking his death (he travelled all over the Essos with his lover), causing a schism and distrust within Rhaenyra’s family. Jace and Luke, feeling betrayed and manipulated by their parents, leave her court to seek glory in the Slaver Wars, separating the once closely-knit family. #13 Main characters response to the big challenge presented by the pinch point. Rhaenyra and Laenor engage in a heated debate that dredges up past grievances while Maester Gerardys advises caution. Daemon and Rhaenyra confront the strained loyalty among their sons, with Jace and Lucerys voicing their disillusionment. #14 – Twist #2 (An unexpected surprise rears up) Intelligence arrives revealing that Aemond’s forces are plotting to steal Rhaenyra’s dragon eggs, but a successful pre-emptive strike by Rhaenyra’s loyalists not only thwarts the plan but captures some of the spies. These spies, under duress, divulge Aemond’s machinations, offering false hope that they might avert the war. #15 Adjustment to the twist. Decision and new action. Rhaenyra and Daemon implement a strategy to use the misled spies as double agents, seeding disinformation to Aemond’s camp. #16 – Turning Point (75%) Major Setback Despite the previous apparent victory, a successful attempt on Rhaenyra’s life occurs, almost claiming her. Meanwhile, prince Aemond goes public with false accusations against Rhaenyra, rallying support from other Westerosi lords and calling for open conflict. #17 Help or strength comes to succeed at the climax. Prepare for the final push. #18 – Turning Point (76-99%) The Climax Prince Aegon, son of Rhaenyra, grown and more capable, stands as a pivotal figure in thwarting the attacks from Aemond and consolidating familial strength. Daemon and Rhaenyra’s reign culminates as they cede power to their son Aegon. Aegon and his brothers defend the Stepstones vs #19 – The Aftermath (90-99%): The Wrap-Up Aegon’s II son Jaehaerys II takes the throne in Westeros, extending an olive branch to Rhaenyra’s branch of the family. With the storm of war passed, both Targaryen branches eye each other warily across the Narrow Sea, establishing an uneasy peace, with the knowledge that the legacy of Rhaenyra’s exile is imprinted deeply upon the fate of their divided dynasty.","output":"To optimize the prompt for ChatGPT, it needs to balance detail with clarity to allow for creative, targeted responses.

Радиус цилиндра равен 8 см. Вычислить площадь осевого сечения цилиндра, его боковую поверхность и объем. Ответ: площадь осевого сечения: боковая поверхность: объем:","output":"Для начала определимся, что такое осевое сечение цилиндра. Осевое сечение цилиндра — это сечение, проходящее через ось вращения цилиндра, оно является прямоугольником, одна сторона которого равна высоте цилиндра (h), а другая — диаметру (2r), если рассматривается прямой круговой цилиндр. Исходя из условия, у нас есть диагональ этого прямоугольника d = 20 см и радиус цилиндра r = 8 см. Необходимо найти высоту h цилиндра. Так как осевое сечение является прямоугольником, а диагональ делит его на два прямоугольных треугольника, мы можем воспользоваться теоремой Пифагора для нахождения высоты: d² = (2r)² + h², где d - диагональ осевого сечения, 2r - диаметр цилиндра. Подставив значения, получим: 20² = (2 * 8)² + h², 400 = 16² + h², 400 = 256 + h², h² = 400 - 256, h² = 144, h = √144, h = 12 см. Теперь мы можем вычислить: 1. Площадь осевого сечения цилиндра (Sос) – это просто площадь прямоугольника со сторонами 2r и h: Sос = 2r * h = 2 * 8 см * 12 см = 16 см * 12 см = 192 см²; 2. Боковая поверхность цилиндра (Sбок) – это площадь боковой поверхности прямого цилиндра, которая равна произведению периметра основания на высоту: Sбок = 2πr * h = 2 * π * 8 см * 12 см ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 8 см * 12 см ≈ 603.19 см²; 3. Объем цилиндра (V) – это произведение площади основания на высоту: V = πr² * h = π * 8 см² * 12 см ≈ 3.1416 * 64 см² * 12 см ≈ 2412.74 см³.

Начальный объем воды в сосуде составляет 1600 см³, а начальный уровень — 20 см. Определим площадь основания сосуда (S). V = S * h, где V — объем воды в сосуде, а h — высота (уровень) воды в сосуде. 1600 см³ = S * 20 см, S = 1600 см³ / 20 см, S = 80 см². Когда деталь погрузили в воду, уровень поднялся на 12 см. Теперь высота уровня воды в сосуде составляет h + 12 см, где h = 20 см. Объем воды при этом увеличивается на объем погруженной детали (Vд). То есть уровень воды теперь составляет 20 см + 12 см = 32 см, а объем вытесненной воды будет равен произведению площади основания сосуда на прирост высоты уровня воды: Vд = S * (h + 12 см) - начальный объем воды, Vд = S * 32 см - 1600 см³, Vд = 80 см² * 32 см - 1600 см³, Vд = 2560 см³ - 1600 см³, Vд = 960 см³.

На какой высоте будет находится уровень жидкости, если ее перелить во второй цилиндрический сосуд, диаметр которого в 2 раза больше диаметра первого?","output":"Поскольку объем жидкости остается постоянным при переливании из одного сосуда в другой, можно использовать формулу для объема цилиндра: [ V = pi r^2 h ] где ( V ) — объем, ( pi ) — число пи, ( r ) — радиус основания цилиндра, а ( h ) — высота (уровень) жидкости. Поскольку первый и второй сосуды имеют форму цилиндров, обозначим: - ( r_1 ) — радиус первого сосуда, - ( h_1 ) — начальная высота жидкости в первом сосуде, - ( r_2 = 2r_1 ) — радиус второго сосуда (в два раза больше первого), - ( h_2 ) — искомая высота жидкости во втором сосуде. Объем жидкости в первом сосуде ( V_1 ) равен: [ V_1 = pi r_1^2 h_1 ] Объем жидкости во втором сосуде ( V_2 ) должен быть таким же, так как жидкость переливается: [ V_2 = pi r_2^2 h_2 ] Из условия задачи известно, что ( r_2 = 2r_1 ), тогда ( r_2^2 = (2r_1)^2 = 4r_1^2 ). Таким образом, можем приравнять объемы: [ pi r_1^2 h_1 = pi r_2^2 h_2 ] [ pi r_1^2 h_1 = pi (4r_1^2) h_2 ] Отсюда выразим высоту жидкости во втором сосуде: [ h_2 = frac{r_1^2 h_1}{4r_1^2} ] [ h_2 = frac{h_1}{4} ] Подставим известные данные из условия задачи, что начальная высота жидкости в первом сосуде (( h_1 )) равна 28 см: [ h_2 = frac{28}{4} ] [ h_2 = 7 text{ см} ] Уровень жидкости во втором сосуде будет находиться на высоте 7 см."},{"instruction":"Первая цилиндрическая кружка в 5 раз выше второй, зато вторая в два раза шире.

Пусть r1 и h1 — радиус и высота первой цилиндрической кружки соответственно. 2. Для второй цилиндрической кружки, поскольку она в два раза шире, радиус r2 будет в два раза больше радиуса первой кружки: r2 = 2r1. А поскольку высота второй кружки в 5 раз меньше, то h2 = h1 / 5. Теперь используем эти данные, чтобы выразить объемы обеих кружек: 1. Объем первой кружки: [ V1 = pi r1^2 h1 ] 2.

Print out the coordinates to ensure they are within the image bounds: Before cropping, print the coordinates \`x\`, \`y\`, \`w\`, \`h\`, and ensure they are within the bounds of the image size. 3. Verify that the Tesseract OCR is returning valid data: Print out the data returned by Tesseract to confirm that you get the bounding box data. Here's a modified version of your code to include these checks: \`\`\`python import cv2 import pytesseract import re # Load image and convert to grayscale image_path = \\"vavavav.png\\" image = cv2.imread(image_path) if image is None: print(\\"Error: Image did not load. Check the file path.\\") exit(1) gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # Get verbose data including bounding boxes data = pytesseract.image_to_data(gray, output_type=pytesseract.Output.DICT) # Define the pattern to search for pattern = r\\"Tovchnebaby|Tovchnèbaby|Tovchnes*baby|Touchmebaby\\" found = False # Iterate over each text item for i in range(len(data['text'])): if re.search(pattern, data['text'][i], re.I): x, y, w, h = data[\\"left\\"][i], data[\\"top\\"][i], data[\\"width\\"][i], data[\\"height\\"][i] # Print the coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box print(\\"Bounding box coordinates and dimensions:\\", x, y, w, h) # Check if the bounding box is within the image dimensions if 0 <= y < image.shape[0] and y + h <= image.shape[0]: # Crop the image to full width and the height of the found pattern crop = image[y:y+h, 0:image.shape[1]] found = True cv2.imshow('Cropped Image', crop) cv2.waitKey(0) # Wait indefinitely for a key press cv2.destroyAllWindows() # Extract number from crop text = pytesseract.image_to_string(crop) print(text) num = re.search(r'd+', text) if num: print(\\"Number found:\\", int(num.group())) else: print(\\"No number found in the cropped area.\\") break else: print(\\"Error: Bounding box is out of image bounds.\\") if not found: print(\\"No match found for the pattern.\\") \`\`\` If you still encounter a gray screen even after image loads correctly and bounding box coordinates are valid, there might be an issue with the cv2.imshow function displaying the window. Lastly, ensure all necessary libraries and the Tesseract OCR engine are installed and set up correctly on your system. If you've made changes to the Tesseract installation path, configure pytesseract as mentioned in my previous response."},{"instruction":"Make me a snake game on python with these features: score, high score, png background, fail and eat sound, background music, difficulty selector at launch, control by arrow keys","output":"Creating a full snake game with sounds and images is a bit too large of a task to provide in detail in this format, but I can guide you on how to approach building the game in Python, particularly with the Pygame library, which is well-suited for making games.

For images and sounds, you will have to provide your own PNG and MP3 files and potentially convert them to the appropriate formats (e.g., \`.png\` for images, \`.ogg\` or \`.wav\` for sounds) if they are not compatible with Pygame. To set difficulty (rather than prompting the user), you could instead create a simple menu using Pygame elements to let the user choose before starting the game.

Here is a whimsical yet scientifically inspired recipe for crafting a high-temperature superconductor: **Ingredients**: 1. A large scoop of copper oxide (the primary ingredient for many high-temperature superconductors) 2. A generous portion of rare-earth elements, such as yttrium or lanthanum (to provide the necessary electron structure) 3. A pinch of barium or strontium (to serve as charge carriers) 4. A sprinkle of oxygen (for the proper oxidation state) 5. A smidgen of an unconventional dopant, like bismuth or thallium (to tweak the crystal structure) 6. A vessel made of the purest quartz (to contain the materials and keep impurities out) 7. An ultra-clean lab environment (to minimize contaminants) 8. A dash of liquid nitrogen for cooling (as most high-temp superconductors still require cold temperatures, though not as extreme as traditional ones) **Tools**: 1. A high-pressure forge (to synthesize the materials under extreme conditions) 2. A controlled atmosphere furnace (for precise oxygenation and temperature control) 3. Precision scales (for exact measurements) 4. Crystal growth apparatus (to facilitate the growth of the superconductor crystal structure) 5. A magnetometer (to test the superconducting properties) 6. A cryostat (to cool the sample and probe its superconducting transition) **Instructions**: 1. Begin by meticulously cleaning your lab environment and all tools to be used. Any impurities might contaminate your superconductor, preventing it from achieving its maximum potential. 2. Measure out the exact proportions of your base materials: copper oxide, a rare-earth element, and your carrier element. Balance is crucial; even a milligram's discrepancy can alter the final product's properties. 3. Gradually mix the copper oxide with your chosen rare-earth element and carrier element in the quartz vessel. This mixture is the precursor to your superconducting phase. 4. Add your oxygen slowly while stirring the mixture to avoid clustering. The proper distribution of oxygen is essential for the crystal lattice structure. 5. Introduce your unconventional dopant to the mix. This ingredient is what may allow your superconductor to operate at higher temperatures, but it should be added with precision, as too much could destabilize the structure. 6. Seal your mixture in the high-pressure forge and subject it to intense pressure and heat. This step simulates the earth's conditions where such materials could naturally form. 7. Once the initial synthesis is complete, transfer the resultant compound to the controlled atmosphere furnace for annealing. Carefully control the oxygen intake and temperature to form a perfect crystal lattice. 8. After the annealing process, cool the material gradually to room temperature to avoid introducing stress fractures into the crystal structure. 9. Test the compound's properties using the magnetometer to ensure it has achieved superconducting characteristics. 10. Finally, place your sample into the cryostat and slowly lower the temperature with liquid nitrogen, closely monitoring the temperature at which superconductivity is achieved. These whimsical instructions are a playful and simplified interpretation of the actual complex and highly technical process of creating a superconductor. Nevertheless, they capture the essence of the precision and care required when working with such sophisticated and delicate materials. In the quest for room-temperature superconductors, real-world researchers continue to experiment with different materials and techniques, continually adding to the scientific knowledge that might one day make this fanciful recipe a reality."},{"instruction":"Use your imagination and think deeply about making the most ideal soccer formation.","output":"When crafting the most ideal soccer formation, the goal is to balance defense, midfield control, and attacking prowess, tailored to the strengths and versatility of the players available. This formation would require players able to adapt to the fluid nature of the game, transitioning seamlessly between defensive solidity and offensive threats. Let's imagine a theoretical 3-4-3 Diamond Hybrid formation which allows for flexibility and covers all aspects of play: **Formation: 3-4-3 Diamond Hybrid** **Defense (3):** Two ball-playing center-backs (CB) flanked by a sweeper/libero. The sweeper's role is critical as they will act as both a defensive lynchpin and a playmaker from the back, leveraging the ability to read the game and contribute to building play from deep positions. This 3-player defensive structure allows for width and can quickly become a back 5 during defensive phases by dropping the wing-backs (described below) into full-back positions. **Midfield (4):** A diamond-shaped midfield provides both width and depth. At the base of the diamond sits a defensive midfielder (DM), responsible for breaking up opposition attacks and offering a shield to the defense. The sides of the diamond are wing-backs (left/right midfielders on the graphic) rather than traditional wingers. While they must be tireless workers, defending as full-backs and attacking as wingers, their hybrid nature allows them to overload midfield when possession is secure. The tip of the diamond features an advanced playmaker or attacking midfielder (AM), assuming a creative role dictating play and providing the link between midfield and attack. This player would roam between the lines, connect play, and open up defensive structures with incisive passing. **Attack (3):** Two inside forwards flank a central striker in this system, cutting inside from the wings to create scoring chances and providing space for the wing-backs to overlap. The central striker holds the line and can act as a pivot, linking play or as a primary goal-scoring threat. The inside forwards should be comfortable interchanging positions, dribbling, and playing both wide and central roles. **Key Characteristics of the Ideal 3-4-3 Diamond Hybrid**: 1. **Fluidity and Interchangeability:** Players must be able to switch positions and fill gaps dynamically. This requires high football intelligence and situational awareness across the team. 2. **Ball Control and Passing:** The system relies on precise ball circulation from the defense through to the attack, anticipating a high level of skill in maintaining possession under pressure. 3. **Stamina:** Wing-backs operate dynamically up and down the flanks, demanding excellent physical conditioning. 4. **Versatility:** Players in this formation need to be adaptive, for example, the AM must be as efficient in goal scoring opportunities as they are in creating assists. 5. **Defensive Stability:** When under attack, the formation needs to fluidly transition to a 5-4-1, with wing-backs retreating and the AM dropping deeper to aid the DM, creating a compact shape that's difficult to penetrate. 6. **Goal-scoring Threat:** With three dedicated forwards supported by attacking-minded midfielders, this formation poses a significant threat from both open play and counter-attacks. 7. **Presence in the Box:** During attacking phases, the formation focuses on getting numbers into the box, whether through the strikers, wing-backs, or the advancing DM and AM. This 3-4-3 Diamond Hybrid would ideally harness the benefits of both width and a strong central presence, being versatile enough to adapt during games. Players would be well-drilled in transitioning between attack, midfield, and defense, operating as a cohesive unit. The formation would create overloads in various areas of the pitch, be defensively secure, and optimally position players to exploit the weaknesses of most opposing team setups. However, even in an ideal setup, success hinges on the tactical discipline of the players, their individual skills, and how well they execute their roles within the collective plan.

The ideal formation is only as good as the team’s ability to implement it on the pitch. 이를 적절히 한국어로 번역","output":"가장 이상적인 축구 포메이션을 구성할 때의 목표는 수비, 미드필드의 조율력, 그리고 공격력의 균형을 맞추되, 사용 가능한 선수들의 강점과 다재다능함에 맞춰 조정하는 것입니다. 이러한 포메이션은 게임의 유동적인 성격에 적응할 수 있는 선수들이 필요하며, 수비의 견고함과 공격적 위협 사이를 매끄럽게 전환할 수 있어야 합니다. 여기서 가정할 수 있는 이론적인 3-4-3 다이아몬드 하이브리드 포메이션이 유연성을 제공하고 모든 경기 측면을 다룰 수 있습니다: 포메이션: 3-4-3 다이아몬드 하이브리드 수비 (3): 두 명의 볼 플레이하는 센터백(CB) 양옆에 스위퍼/리베로가 위치합니다. 스위퍼는 방어의 핵심 역할 뿐만 아니라 뒤에서 플레이를 만들어내는 플레이메이커로서도 활동하며, 게임을 읽는 능력을 바탕으로 깊은 위치에서 플레이를 구축합니다. 이 3명으로 이루어진 수비 구조는 폭을 제공하며, 수비 단계에서 윙백이 풀백 위치로 내려와 5명의 수비수로 빠르게 전환될 수 있습니다. 미드필드 (4): 다이아몬드 형태의 미드필드는 폭과 깊이를 제공합니다. 다이아몬드의 기저에는 수비형 미드필더(DM)가 위치해 상대의 공격을 분쇄하고 수비에 방패 역할을 합니다. 다이아몬드의 양 옆면은 전통적인 윙어가 아닌 윙백(그래픽상의 왼쪽/오른쪽 미드필더)입니다. 윙백은 풀백으로서 수비하고 윙어로서 공격하는 등 많은 노력이 필요한 위치이며, 소유권이 확보되었을 때 미드필드를 과부하시킬 수 있습니다. 다이아몬드의 끝에는 고급 플레이메이커 혹은 공격형 미드필더(AM)가 위치하여 창의적인 역할을 담당하며, 미드필드와 공격 사이의 연결고리 역할을 하고, 예리한 패스로 상대의 수비 구조를 무너뜨립니다. 이 선수는 라인 사이를 돌아다니며, 연결 플레이를 하고, 상대 수비를 뚫어주는 역할을 합니다. 공격 (3): 이 시스템에서 두 명의 인사이드 포워드가 중앙 스트라이커를 양옆에서 보조하며, 측면에서 안으로 자르며 득점 기회를 만들고 윙백에게 오버래핑을 위한 공간을 제공합니다. 중앙 스트라이커는 선을 유지하고 플레이를 연결하는 피벗 역할이나 주요 득점 위협으로 활동할 수 있습니다. 인사이드 포워드는 위치를 바꿔가며, 드리블을 하고, 측면과 중앙 역할을 모두 수행하는 데에 편안해져야 합니다. 이상적인 3-4-3 다이아몬드 하이브리드의 주요 특징: 1. 유동성과 교체가능성: 위치를 바꾸고 동적으로 공백을 메울 수 있는 능력이 필요합니다. 이것은 팀 전체에 걸쳐 높은 축구 지능과 상황 인식을 요구합니다. 2. 볼 컨트롤과 패스 정확도: 이 체계는 방어부터 공격까지 정확한 볼 순환에 의존하므로, 압박을 받아도 소유권을 유지하는 데 높은 수준의 기술이 예상됩니다. 3. 체력: 윙백은 측면을 상하로 역동적으로 운용해야 하므로 훌륭한 체력 조건이 요구됩니다. 4. 다재다능함: 예를 들어, AM은 도움을 줄 때만큼 득점 기회에서도 효율적이어야 합니다. 5. 수비 안정성: 공격을 받고 있을 때, 그 형태는 윙백이 후퇴하고 AM이 더 깊숙이 내려가 DM을 도와 5-4-1의 견고한 형태로 유동적으로 전환될 필요가 있습니다. 6. 득점 위협: 세 명의 전담 공격수와 공격적인 미드필더의 지원으로, 이 포메이션은 개방된 플레이와 역습 모두에서 상당한 위협을 제기합니다. 7. 상자 안 존재감: 공격 단계에서, 포메이션은 스트라이커, 윙백 또는 전진하는 DM과 AM을 통해 상자 안에 인원을 집중시키는 데 초점을 맞춥니다. 이 3-4-3 다이아몬드 하이브리드는 이상적으로 폭과 강력한 중앙 존재감의 이점을 활용하면서, 경기 중에 적응할 수 있을 만큼 충분히 다재다능합니다. 선수들은 공격, 미드필드, 수비 간의 전환에서 잘 훈련되어 조화로운 단위로 작동합니다. 이 포메이션은 필드의 다양한 영역에서 과부하를 만들어내고, 수비적으로 안전하며, 상대 팀 설정의 약점을 이용하는 데에 선수들을 최적의 위치에 배치합니다. 하지만, 이상적인 설정에서도, 선수들의 전술적인 훈련도, 개인 기술, 그리고 그들이 단체 계획 안에서 역할을 얼마나 잘 실행하는지에 성공이 좌우됩니다. 이상적인 포메이션은 팀이 그것을 그라운드에서 실현할 수 있는 능력만큼만 좋습니다."},{"instruction":"Traducir los siguientes textos de español a chino en el contexto legal, y tener en cuenta lo siguiente: - Los nombres propios de personas, entidades, empresas, lugar, calles, ciudades, etc. se mantiene en español. - Se traduce en chino primero los tomos y luego los folios. - Los nombres chinos debe empezar por el apellido. - No dejar espacio entre los caracteres alfanuméricos y chinos.","output":"Claro, necesitaré los textos específicos en español que quieres traducir al chino en el contexto legal.

Here's a summary of the effects and the relationship of these developments to European imperialism: 1. **Effects of Industrialization and Technological Change:** - Economic Growth: There was an unprecedented increase in goods production and economic development. - Urbanization: People moved from rural areas to cities in search of jobs, altering traditional lifestyles. - Class Changes: A new social order with industrialists and a growing middle class emerged, while the working class faced harsh factory conditions. - Environmental Impact: Widespread pollution and resource exploitation grew alongside industrial activities. - Global Trade: Innovations in transport, like steamships and railways, increased global trade and the exchange of ideas. - Communications: Technological advancements like the telegraph facilitated faster communication across continents. 2. **Industrial Revolution Leading to European Imperialism:** - Raw Materials: European industries required raw materials which they sought aggressively overseas. - Markets: The growing production required new markets for goods, leading European nations to seek control of regions where they could sell their products. - Surplus Capital: With the accumulation of wealth, Europeans invested in colonies to further their economic interests. 3. **Three Main Causes/Motives of Imperialism:** - Economic Motives: Desire for new markets and raw materials. - Political Motives: National prestige, strategic advantages, and the desire for power. - Social/Cultural Motives: Spread European civilization, perceived as superior (which includes religious reasons and cultural imperialism). Evaluating the importance of these motives is subjective, but many historians agree that economic motives were paramount, as the acquisition of resources and markets drove imperialism. 4. **Justification of Imperialism Using Biological Racism:** - Europeans used pseudoscientific theories that claimed white Europeans were biologically superior to other races. - They asserted that imperialist policies were part of a natural hierarchy and a duty to \\"civilize\\" the world. - Terms like 'White Man's Burden' exemplified the justification for ruling non-white peoples based on a perceived racial hierarchy. 5. **Resistance to European Imperialism:** - Armed Conflicts: Many non-white peoples engaged in military resistance against European forces. - Cultural Resistance: Preserving indigenous culture in the face of pressure to assimilate. - Rebellion and Revolts: Upsetting the administrative workings of empires through unrest and revolts such as the Sepoy Mutiny in India. 6. **China vs. Japan's Experiences:** - China tried to resist European imperialism but was weakened by internal conflicts like the Taiping Rebellion and external pressure leading to unequal treaties and spheres of influence. - Japan, under the Meiji Era, modernized rapidly, embracing Western technology while preserving its sovereignty, resulting in its emergence as an imperial power itself, exemplified by its victory in the Russo-Japanese War. Now, let's define the terms provided: - **Assimilation:** A policy whereby colonized peoples were encouraged or forced to adopt the culture of the imperial power. - **Open Door Notes:** US policy statements that aimed for equal trading rights among nations in China. - **African Resistance:** Various forms of opposition by Africans to the European colonization of Africa. - **Boxer Rebellion:** A 1900 nationalist uprising in China against foreigners, imperialism, and Christianity. - **Ethiopia and Menelik II:** Menelik II was the emperor of Ethiopia who successfully resisted European colonization. - **Imperialism:** The policy of extending a country's power through military force or diplomacy. - **Racism:** The belief in the superiority of one race over another. - **White Man's Burden:** A concept from a poem by Rudyard Kipling that suggested it was the duty of white men to civilize and govern non-white peoples. - **Biological Racism:** The idea that races have inherent biological differences that determine their social behavior and role in society. - **Sepoy:** Indian soldiers employed by the British East India Company. - **\\"Jewel in the Crown\\":** Britain's term for India, considering its importance within the British Empire. - **Colony:** A territory under the immediate political control of a state or nation. - **Tokugawa Shogunate:** The last feudal Japanese military government, which existed between 1603 and 1867. - **Sepoy Mutiny/Rebellion:** A 1857 revolt of the Sepoy troops in British India leading to the transfer of control to the British Crown. - **Congo:** A central African region; King Leopold II of Belgium exploited it harshly for rubber and ivory. - **Raj:** The British rule in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947. - **King Leopold II:** The Belgian king who orchestrated the colonization of the Congo in the late 19th century. - **Treaty of Kanagawa:** An 1854 US-Japan agreement that opened Japan to Western trade. - **Social Darwinism:** The application of Darwinian ideas to society, justifying inequality and the domination by stronger nations. - **Berlin Conference:** A 1884-1885 meeting where European powers negotiated the partitioning of Africa. - **Meiji Era:** A period of rapid modernization and westernization in Japan from 1868 to 1912. - **Opium War:** Conflicts between China and Britain in the mid-19th century, primarily over the British trade of opium in China. - **Russo-Japanese War:** A 1904-1905 conflict between Russia and Japan primarily over control of areas in Korea and Manchuria. - **Extraterritorial Rights:** Privileges granting citizens of one country immunity from the jurisdiction of the law of the country they live in. - **Annexation:** The act of adding a territory to an existing state or country. - **Taiping Rebellion:** A massive civil war in southern China from 1850 to 1864 against the ruling Qing dynasty. - **Scramble for Africa:** The rapid colonization of Africa by European countries in the late 19th century. - **Sphere of Influence:** A region in which a foreign power has the exclusive rights and privileges, often economic."},{"instruction":"Complete the following phrases with the appropriate form of haber. 1. yo _ comido 2. ella _ escrito 3. él _ soñado 4. ellos _ pedido 5. nosotras _ preparado 6. tú_ estudiado 7. ustedes _ aprendido 8. ellas _ paseado 9. nosotros _ bebido 10. usted _ olvidado Rewrite each sentence in the present perfect tense.

Make it seem important even though you haven't done a lot of things science related.","output":"As a freshman in high school, my journey into the fascinating world of science is just beginning, but already, I am actively engaging in activities that lay the foundation for my scientific understanding and fuel my passion for this field. **Science Classes:** My engagement with science starts in the classroom. I'm currently enrolled in a rigorous biology course that covers a wide range of topics, from cellular processes to the diversity of life. The course doesn't only entail absorbing facts; it emphasizes a hands-on approach through laboratory experiments. There, I conduct experiments that are essential for practical learning, such as examining microscopic cells and understanding genetic traits through Punnett squares. These labs complement the theoretical knowledge and cultivate an analytical mindset. **Science Club:** Beyond the classroom, I have joined the school's Science Club—an extracurricular group that meets weekly to discuss a variety of scientific topics and conduct small group experiments. Though I am one of the newest members, I actively participate in discussions, sharing my insights and learning from upperclassmen about advanced scientific concepts and current events in the science community. **Science Fair Project:** I am currently brainstorming ideas for my first science fair project. Although I have not yet finalized my experiment, the process of researching and exploring various scientific problems has already taught me the importance of the scientific method, hypothesis testing, and the process of trial and error in research. The science fair is a significant opportunity for me to apply classroom knowledge in a competitive yet educational environment. **Community Stewardship:** On a community level, I've volunteered for local clean-up efforts which directly relate to environmental science. These activities not only contribute to the well-being of the environment but also allow me to see the practical impacts of human activity on ecosystems. This has sparked my interest in environmental preservation and sustainability and has made me more aware of the roles we can play in protecting our planet. **Home Experiments:** Lastly, my curiosity doesn’t end at school. At home, I conduct simple experiments using household items to satisfy my inquisitive nature. For instance, by creating a homemade volcano or a rudimentary battery, I foster an innovative spirit and understanding of chemical reactions and electricity. Each of these activities, though they may seem small in isolation, are integral steps in my burgeoning scientific career. They represent not just my current involvement, but my commitment to a future in which science plays a pivotal role. Through these various avenues, I am laying down a strong foundation of knowledge and experience upon which I will continue to build throughout high school and beyond."},{"instruction":"write about how you took out of school science classes. make it short and simple","output":"I recognized early on that my passion for science couldn't be confined to the regular school curriculum.

A few weeks earlier, I’d discovered that there was a massive gap between the person I was—insecure and self-centered—and the person I wanted to be— secure and focused on serving others. That realization initially frightened me, but I am grateful that I chose to confront the discomfort head-on instead of avoiding it. A veil was lifted, and I felt fully awake for the first time. It was 2015, and I had just secured a summer sales internship with a small software firm, and with just a year remaining before graduation, I was eager to gain some work experience before I graduated and was forced into a nine-to-five lifestyle. My new boss Kyle became a mentor. He was an avid podcast listener and would put on personal development and business podcasts whenever we had long car rides together. He explained to me that while he enjoyed listening to music, he realized that replaying a song for the 300th time wasn’t going to get him closer to his dream life. He understood that, on the other hand, the right personal development podcast might. Growing up, I wasn’t receptive to this kind of educational content. After observing the positive impact these shows were having on Kyle, I decided to incorporate them into my daily commute routine. Up until that point, I held a belief that business podcasts were solely meant for dull and boring businesspeople. Yet, Kyle was a personable guy who loved to party and have a good time. I soon realized that investing in personal growth was a predictor for success and should be discussed confidently. Those first couple of weeks were eye-opening to me. I tried many different podcast formats, but I found the most value in those where the host interviewed successful people and talked with them about what they had done to become successful. The advice was always very practical and so, in no time at all, I had a laundry list of subjects that I wanted to learn more about. This is where my initial interest in personal development books came from. So many of these podcasters and their guests were recommending titles, and I began to hear some of the same ones over and over. These people made it seem like I was missing out on the world’s best kept secrets by choosing not to read. In one podcast, the guest said that successful people often condense decades of their life experience into mere days by writing books. As readers, we can consume that information quickly and use it to navigate future obstacles, saving us a boatload of time and headaches. Personal experience is a great teacher, but another person’s experience can be even better because you can learn the lesson without feeling the pain. Time to hit the bookstore and find out what the hype was all about! Little did I know that the books I was about to purchase would dramatically change my life. My First Books Armed with the shopping list I’d compiled from the podcasts I’d listened to, I cautiously entered Barnes & Noble. This first trip took place during my internship lunch hour, so I didn’t have too much time to shop around before I had to return to the office. I remember being in awe of how many personal development books were available. So. Many. Options. I was equally overwhelmed and excited at the same time. As I browsed the endless shelves, there seemed to be a book for just about every problem in my life. Consulting my list, I grabbed copies of Rich Dad Poor Dad and Cashflow Quadrant by Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter; The Art of War by Sun Tzu; The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clayson; and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. I was delighted to find everything I was looking for, and I even grabbed a handful of other titles that caught my attention on the way to the cashier. As I went to pay, I experienced a moment of uncertainty as I thought about my bank account. Should a college student without much money be spending what little he has on books? At around 20 per book, I was about to spend almost 200. Thankfully, I remembered another lesson I had learned during one of my podcast sessions: The best investment you can make is in yourself. The most cost-effective investment in yourself is not a formal education, a week-long retreat, or an online course…it’s a book. Why? Books only cost 20 and take just a few hours to consume, yet they hold the same power to change your life as any of those other resources. The potential return on investment (ROI) is insane! At the checkout, I signed up for a store membership card. I knew that to really shift my identity from a non-reader to a reader, I had to commit. Carrying the membership card around in my wallet seemed like something a reader would do. Plus, I got a good discount for signing up, which made me feel better. By simply buying a few books, I could already feel my potential starting to grow. It was as if instantly, a switch had been flipped, and I was now on a very different path in life. Since my responsibilities during that internship weren’t particularly time-consuming, I spent a fair amount of that afternoon and the rest of that summer reading those books. My reading speed was slow, and I wasn’t sure how to take effective notes or implement what I was learning, but I was hooked. I began with Rich Dad Poor Dad—I still have that copy today. I am so grateful that I chose to read it first. Rich Dad Poor Dad was actionable, easy to understand, educational, and short enough for a new reader like me to get through in a few days. If I had started with a different book, I might have disliked it, given up, and shelved the rest of the books I’d purchased. Unfortunately, that happens to a lot of new readers. A book is not valuable to a reader unless it gives them something to implement, an action that will change their lives for the better. Yet the truth is, we as readers get to choose what to implement and for most readers, they choose to implement nothing. I know many people who have read Rich Dad Poor Dad and found it useless. For me, it changed everything. Being a business student who didn’t yet know much about money, something amazing happened after reading these initial books, most of which were about personal finance and investing. In a matter of weeks, I went from someone who withdrew from conversations about money to someone who frequently led them. I went from someone who shied away from setting a post-graduation earnings goal to someone who was looking at multiple six-figure opportunities. If that could happen after reading just a few books, I began thinking about other areas of my life to which I could apply this new superpower. This obvious solution to every problem I was facing was hiding in plain sight— and for only 20 a pop. Was I really on track to level up in every area of my life? Growing Up I had the best childhood. My parents worked hard to give my younger brothers and me that ‘white picket fence’ type family experience. I had friends in the neighborhood, trees to climb, and I played a lot of sports. I was always healthy and ate well, I received tons of love from my parents, and we had plenty of presents under the Christmas tree every year. Outside of some social anxiety, I was always very happy. Not much changed as I got a bit older. I played football and was the captain of our high school wrestling team. Having three younger brothers, all close in age, I developed a love for competition that I still hold today. I could find a way to turn just about anything, physical or intellectual, into a competition. The upside was that I gained confidence in certain areas of my life, but the downside was that my confidence eventually developed into an ego and sense of entitlement. I wasn’t always the most fun to be around and I spent a lot of time focusing on myself, sometimes at the expense of others. The one area where I lacked confidence was in my ability to communicate in front of new people. When I was in a small group of friends that I felt comfortable with, I thrived when all eyes were on me—it felt great. However, the moment I had to present in front of the class or go outside of my comfort zone, anxiety would punch me in the face. You know that feeling? Heart thumping and a pit in your stomach? I didn’t understand the benefits of embracing discomfort back then, which meant that I did anything I could to avoid those public-speaking situations. I suppose this form of social anxiety is why I was never a reader growing up. Most class presentations happened in the reading-intensive classes like English, Spanish, or history. I remember being above average in critical thinking and private test-taking subjects like math, but way below average in oral communication and presentation-based subjects like the ones mentioned above. Unfortunately, the public education system and classroom dynamics I grew up in taught students to avoid failure at all costs. The thought of stuttering or misreading something in front of the entire class and having everyone laugh terrified me. There were times where I would pretend to be sick on presentation days so that my parents would let me stay home. That way, I could work with teachers one-on-one after school instead of speaking in front of my peers. I even used to get up and head to the bathroom before it was my turn to read out loud in English class. My social anxiety was crippling, but because I cared way too much about what people thought of me, I did a great job at hiding it. That was my reality back then, and I put in a lot of hard work over the years to change it. I know now that failure leads to progress, and it should not be discouraged. In fact, I believe that embracing failure is one of the first building blocks for success. Since I disliked school and spent a lot of time playing sports, I was always looking for shortcuts. I would read book summaries online instead of the actual books and rely on other students to help me get by. That same behavior followed me into college. I didn’t realize it then, but I had some major problems to fix. On one hand, I was self-centered and full of ego. On the other, I was doing anything I could to navigate my social anxiety, causing me to live with a lot of fear. Since my mom worked in retail management and my dad in athletic footwear sales, I decided that the business world was where I belonged. I was accepted into the University of New Hampshire and took entry-level business classes during my first semester. My early professors encouraged me to find a summer internship where I could explore the different areas of business and discover something that I liked. Throughout my years at school, I secured two placements that totally changed my life. The first was in a company that helped college students run their own house painting businesses during the summer. Focused on the earning potential, I totally missed the fact that I would have to generate my own sales by knocking on doors every weekend and then hire college students to complete the jobs I sold. I could fill this whole book with the mistakes I made during that first summer. However, those same mistakes resulted in me facing some of my social anxiety—and my ego. Through my experiences door-to-door selling, I was starting to learn how to communicate more effectively. I was constantly humbled by the rejection. The biggest lesson of all? You can become comfortable with anything. Remember those social anxiety nerves that caused me to stay home from school? They were showing up less frequently. All it took was a bit of courage and some basic repetition. In fact, out of every aspect of the job, which included marketing, selling, operations, management, and finance, I found the most enjoyment in selling. After two full summers of running a house painting business, I realized that I needed to get more sales experience and improve my communication skills in order to secure a great job after graduation. I enrolled in some public-speaking classes and spent my final summer at the software internship I mentioned above, where I discovered my passion for books. My social anxiety from high school had created certain barriers to my learning. Thankfully, I was still open enough to take my boss Kyle’s suggestions and begin exploring podcasts. Having a fixed mindset where you believe that you’re already the best and that there is nothing out there to learn is a very dangerous place to be. Did I come out of the womb reading books? No. Not even close. For years, I was able to read but actively chose not to. I was living under my potential. Now, I embrace the universal truth that we are all capable of becoming more and designing our dream life. The ability to read these books and apply their teachings is one of the most underutilized skills we have today. Reading Time I can’t even imagine what my life would be like if I hadn’t started reading personal development books. I can guarantee, though, that it wouldn’t be nearly as fulfilling. I am now in my late 20s and have read hundreds of books. The math is mind-boggling to me: 400+ books Average of 250 pages/book 400+ books * 250 pages = 100,000+ pages If you had tapped me on the shoulder in high school and told me that I was going to read and digest 100,000 pages of information before I was 30, I would have called you crazy. When I started my reading journey, I was a very slow reader. We will discuss reading speed later, but for now, know that reading can be broken down into a set of individual skills. Each of these skills can be improved with time, repetition, and better strategies. For the sake of simplicity, let’s say that I read at an average of .67 pages (two thirds of a page) per minute: 100,000 pages = 150,000 minutes 150,000 minutes / 60 minutes = 2,500 hours of reading Is that a lot of time? I am not sure. It’s not the 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell talks about in his blockbuster book Outliers, but I am sure when you include the time I have spent implementing everything I have read, I would be close to 10,000 hours. Take that, Malcolm! My life has been completely transformed, and I owe just about everything I have now to those 2,500 hours of reading. I am healthier, wealthier, and happier than I have ever been, and I am continuing to make more progress. For years now, I have worked in the book industry and my businesses have given me access to tens of thousands of non-fiction readers on a weekly basis. I receive all sorts of questions, and I am going to address dozens of the most common ones throughout this book: How do I choose the right book? How should I take notes? How can I apply what I’m learning? My promise to you is that by the time you’re done reading the first half of this book, you’ll have the strategies and framework to effectively retain and implement more from the books you read. The right book at the right time can change your life…especially if you implement what they teach you effectively. The second half will introduce over 100 habits that I’ve implemented in my own life from the books I’ve read. I’ll take you through my experiences of implementing them—the good, the bad, and the ugly—and they will, in turn, be motivators for you too. I wrote this book because I wish I’d had access to this information when I was starting my reading journey back in 2015. It took hundreds of books and countless failed attempts at implementing them before I came up with the strategies and best practices that I share with you here. Do you have to read 400+ books to design your dream life? Absolutely not. I have condensed many of my favorite life lessons from the books I’ve read into this one so that you can accelerate your journey. Consider this book a cheat code, giving you the tools to navigate the world of personal development with ease. This book is not designed to entertain you; this book is designed to educate you. Nowadays, I am focused on helping as many people as possible bridge the gap between who they are today and who they can become. I see books as the vehicle to bridge that gap because that is how I was able to do it. Back in 2018, I started sharing the books that I was reading on social media and writing short book reviews. Eventually, my following grew to a point where authors were reaching out and asking if they could pay me to review their books. Get paid to read? That sounded like a dream. Fast forward a few years and my business, BookThinkers, is helping hundreds of authors connect with more readers and helping thousands of readers find the right authors to guide and inform them. This work makes me very happy. This is my world, and I can’t wait to walk you through it. Living Under Your potential Early in my reading journey, someone recommended The Top Five Regrets of the Dying by Bronnie Ware to me. Reading that book changed my perspective on life and death. As an end-of-life caretaker, Bronnie spent a lot of time with the dying. She found that most people on their deathbed wish they’d had the courage to live a life true to themselves, not the life others expected of them. It was heartbreaking to read about these people who had finally achieved a sense of clarity about what truly mattered to them but couldn’t act on it because they were near the end of their life. They were prisoners of their own regret. Regret is poison. Living below your potential will poison you. As human beings, we have a finite amount of time here—you don’t want to be on your deathbed wishing you had done more with your life. There are two deathbed visualizations that really drive this point home for me. I encourage you to spend a few minutes reflecting on each of them now: Deathbed Visualization #1 Picture yourself at Heaven’s Gate, ready to look back on your life and receive judgment. As you’re standing there, you look to your right and see other versions of yourself. Those versions of you talk about a life of no regrets. They speak of pursuing their passions relentlessly, facing each opportunity with unwavering faith. They talk about striving to be the best version of themselves for their family and friends. In life, they were truly healthy, wealthy, and happy. Then they turn to you and ask, “How about you? Did you take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and explore all of what life has to offer?” Given your current life trajectory, how would you answer? Let it sink in. At any given moment, we have an infinite number of choices in front of us, which means there are infinite future versions of ourselves out there. Some decisions will get us closer to happiness and fulfillment whereas others won’t. The beautiful (and scary) thing is that we are in control of those choices. Deathbed Visualization #2 Picture yourself on your deathbed, alone, unable to get up and realize your unfulfilled dreams. An angel appears and calmly asks, “How much would you be willing to spend to magically go back in time to (insert the year you’re reading this) and experience a few days with your family and friends?” Really think about it for a moment. I bet you’d be willing to spend anything, right? You’d go back in time and live life to the fullest, taking nothing for granted, especially your time. The sad part is that no amount of money will allow you to travel back in time, regain mobility, and spend time with your loved ones. We all admire the wealth that Warren Buffett has accumulated, but I’ll bet that none of us would trade places with him. At the time of this writing, Warren is 92 years old. Our youth, whether we’re 18 or 80, is everything. We can’t buy back time. Now, snap back to reality and experience the present moment with old eyes. What is stopping you from living up to your full potential right now? Fear of judgment? Fear of failure? The author Steven Pressfield calls the forces that hold us back “resistance.” The strangest part about the resistance we face is that it comes from within. We create our own resistance. The fears that push us to live under our potential are nothing more than figments of our own imagination. They are not forced upon us, and they don’t exist when we are gone. Don’t fall prey to the idea that you are going to live forever. According to the CDC, the average lifespan for someone living in the US is 77.3 That means that by 38.5, you’re already halfway there. Focus on this and let the magic of mortality guide your actions. The beautiful thing is that this heightened awareness of your own mortality also creates vulnerability, reflection, and an openness to learn. Do not ignore the moments of your life that offer you the opportunity to learn the most. This book is one of those moments. The good news is that if you are reading this, you’re already on the way to changing your life. Most people buy books like this and then ignore them. Stick with it, because as this book progresses, so does its value. The world needs more thinkers.","output":"From the text you've provided, here is a comprehensive summary of what I've learned: 1.

Voici quelques éléments à considérer : 1. **Expérience et Niveau Actuel** : Si vous avez déjà une expérience considérable à un niveau semi-professionnel ou amateur élevé, il pourrait être plus faisable de faire le saut vers le professionnalisme. 2. **Condition Physique** : Le football est un sport exigeant physiquement. À 30 ans, vous devriez être dans une condition physique exceptionnelle pour rivaliser avec les joueurs déjà établis qui sont souvent plus jeunes et au pic de leur forme physique. 3. **Opportunités et Réseau**: Le football professionnel fonctionne beaucoup par le biais de réseaux et de contacts. Sans connections dans le monde du football, il serait plus difficile de se faire remarquer ou de se voir offrir une chance. 4. **Volonté de Commencer en Bas** : Si vous êtes prêt à commencer dans les divisions inférieures ou dans des ligues moins compétitives, cela pourrait augmenter vos chances de construire une carrière tardive dans le football. 5. **Compétences et Talent** : Vous devez être extrêmement talentueux et avoir des compétences qui se démarquent. Les clubs chercheraient à vous recruter si vous pouviez apporter une valeur immédiate à l'équipe. 6. **Réalisme des Objectifs** : Il est important de rester réaliste sur les objectifs et les attentes. Atteindre le haut niveau, comme les grandes ligues européennes, est peu probable, mais des opportunités pourraient exister dans des ligues inférieures ou dans des pays avec des championnats moins compétitifs. Il existe des cas où des joueurs ont débuté le football professionnel tardivement ou ont changé de carrière pour devenir footballeurs, comme Ian Wright et Didier Drogba, qui ont commencé leurs carrières professionnelles autour de l'âge de 21-24 ans, ce qui est déjà considéré tardif dans le monde du football. Si vous êtes sérieux dans cette démarche, vous devez commencer par vous entraîner intensivement et participer à des essais ouverts ou vous connecter avec des clubs locaux.

In good times and bad you've been here; I can only wish I could have been the same kind of friend for you. Still, I am thankful you have not forgotten about me. I wanted to share some music for your consideration. Recently, I discovered the artistry and musicianship of Xavier Gagnepain, a remarkable French cellist who works as a professor at the Académie internationale d'été de Nice. Unfortunately it was not through attending a live performance, but I've grown to appreciate his abilities just the same through hearing some of his work on YouTube.

The chord progression is elusive, the song has no clear destination, and whether it's melancholy or freedom, it's a work of art that seems simple but seems to be supported by profound ideas.

It's amazing how sometimes it takes a discerning ear like yours to detect the deeper flavors hidden within the harmonies. Your description paints such a vivid picture that I can almost taste the music – a blend of melancholy and freedom – a recipe complex in its simplicity. The intricacies of the chord progression and its elusive destination that you've captured in your message speak volumes about your refined perception. Finding light at 2:08 – the moment where the piece starts to unravel its secrets to you – is a testament to your patience and attentiveness to the art. Music does indeed speak a universal language, yet it whispers unique revelations to each listener. I'm thrilled that you've found the jacket fabulous as well. It does not surprise me that not only the music but also the aesthetics of the presentation would catch your eye. It's these layers of appreciation that make the act of sharing all the more worthwhile. Isn't it intriguing how music can serve as a mirror, reflecting on our personal experiences and emotions? Each interpretation is personal and profound, just as our conversations have always been. Your words continue to inspire me, and they are a reminder to listen more closely and appreciate the nuances, both in art and in life. I look forward to exchanging more musical finds and the thoughtful discourse that follows. Perhaps next time, we can explore a genre that is completely different, yet equally capable of stirring our souls. Until then, keep the tunes playing and the chocolate chips revealing themselves in the most unexpected moments.

As someone who finds resonance in the message of embracing individuality, I’m reaching out with a heartfelt request, inspired by the very community I’m proud to call a second family—the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC). My name is Cameron McCaffrey, a volunteer at BRAC, where I’ve had the privilege to serve alongside individuals who, like many of us, strive to showcase their unique talents and character. This hasn’t been the only journey I’ve embraced in life. Diagnosed with Asperger’s from an early age, understanding and relishing global nuances stood as a towering quest—one that’s enriched by the unwavering support of loved ones and mentors. Yet, in the autumnal shifts of October 2023, my life was eclipsed by personal tragedy when I lost both my parents within nine short days. With the aid and abiding comfort of the BRAC’s executive director, Evelyn Falconer, and a caring community, I’ve been steadily rebuilding my life. Your remarkable journey, not only as a powerhouse in the music industry and a cinematic talent but also as an outspoken advocate for mental health and a compassionate ally to those in need, truly inspires me. When one reaches such depths and ascends, the narrative of resilience becomes a beacon for others to follow. Would you be willing to share that light with the students at BRAC? The vision of BRAC aligns with the values I see you champion, fostering a supportive educational realm for students aged 11-22 with autism and related disabilities. With a rich curriculum, life, and vocational skills training, BRAC nurtures potential, independence, and audacity to dream—the very essence of what you advocate through your work and outreach. Our students would be immeasurably uplifted by your presence. To see someone of your stature, who’s navigated the vastness of dreams and adversities, stand amidst them, would invigorate their aspirations. It could be a moment of encouragement, a spark that fuels their journey towards a life full of purpose and pride. We understand the multitudes that command your schedule; however, if you find it in your heart to grace us with your visit, please know it would be received with boundless gratitude and joy. For further details about BRAC and the life-changing work being done, I encourage you to explore https://bocaratonachievement.com. Ms. Falconer would be delighted to converse with you directly to provide any additional insights and facilitation. She can be contacted by phone at +1 (561) 559-9768 (business)/+1 (561) 427-8710 (personal), by email at care4kids2@gmail.com. BRAC is located at: 500 NE Spanish River Blvd., Suite 30, Boca Raton, FL 33431 Ms. Grande, it would be an indescribable honor to host you. With unfeigned respect for your advocacy for empathy and understanding in the broader narrative, I wait with hope. Additionally, your voice melding with the vibrant symphony of progress at BRAC could very well be the chorus that reaffirms their value in the world—a value immense and undeniable.

An influential figure in contemporary popular music, often regarded as a pop icon, she is noted for her four-octave vocal range and whistle register that has led to comparisons with Mariah Carey. Grande has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, one Bambi Award, two Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, 35 Guinness World Records, among others. Grande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical 13. She rose to fame for playing Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013), and signed with Republic Records in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album, Yours Truly (2013), topped the US Billboard 200, while its lead single, \\"The Way\\", reached the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. She experimented with EDM on her second studio album My Everything (2014) and achieved success with its singles \\"Problem\\", \\"Break Free\\" and \\"Bang Bang\\". Grande further explored pop and R&B with her third studio album Dangerous Woman (2016), her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK.

While consistently maintaining pop and R&B tones, she has increasingly incorporated trap into her music as her career has progressed,[264] thanks to her work with record producer Tommy Brown.[265] She has collaborated with Brown on every album thus far and stated that \\"one of the things I love most about working with Tommy is that none of the beats he plays me ever sound the same.\\"[266] Grande learned how to sound engineer and produce her own vocals because she \\"love[s] being hands on\\" with every project, revealing that rapper Mac Miller first taught her how to use the digital audio workstation Pro Tools.[267] Collaborator Justin Tranter remarked that he felt inspired seeing how involved Grande is in creating her music \\"from the writing to the vision to the storytelling and to even engineering and comping her own vocals.\\"[268] She has co-written songs addressing a wide variety of themes, such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.[269] Grande's debut album Yours Truly was complimented for recreating the R&B \\"vibe and feel of the 90s\\" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface.[270] Her follow-up record, My Everything, explored EDM and electropop genres.[271] Grande expanded the pop and R&B sound on her third album, Dangerous Woman, which was praised by the Los Angeles Times for integrating elements of different styles, such as reggae-pop (\\"Side to Side\\"), dance-pop (\\"Be Alright\\"), and guitar-trap fusion (\\"Sometimes\\").[272] Trap-pop was more heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener and Thank U, Next.[264] Elias Leight of Rolling Stone opined that Grande \\"set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming\\" and \\"embrace[d] the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop\\" on Sweetener, exploring funk music with themes of love and prosperity.[273][274] Craig Jenkins of Vulture noted that she embraced trap and hip hop with undertones of R&B on Thank U, Next,[275] with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love.[274] Her sixth album, Positions, further emphasized the R&B and trap-pop sound of its two predecessors, with lyrics discussing sex and romance.[276][277] Influences Mariah Carey Whitney Houston Grande credits Mariah Carey (left) and Whitney Houston (right) as her major vocal influences. Grande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music.[258] She credited Gloria Estefan with inspiring her to pursue a music career after Estefan saw and complimented Grande's performance on a cruise ship when she was eight years old.[278] Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are her primary vocal influences: \\"I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it.\\"[279][280] Grande was also influenced vocally by Destiny's Child, Beyoncé,[281] Celine Dion and Madonna.[282] She reflected on her childhood by posting videos of herself singing songs from Dion's 1997 album Let's Talk About Love on her social media.[283] Grande credits Madonna with \\"pav[ing] the way for me and also every other female artist\\" and admitted to being \\"obsessed with her entire discography\\".[284][285] Musically, Grande admires India Arie because her \\"music makes me feel like everything is going to be okay\\", loves Brandy's songs because \\"her riffs are incredibly on point,\\" and praised Imogen Heap's \\"intricate\\" song structure.[274] Grande also named Judy Garland as a childhood influence, admiring her ability to tell \\"a story when she sings\\",[274] and named \\"Over the Rainbow\\" as one of the first songs she remembers singing because \\"Wizard Of Oz was always my favorite movie when I was younger.\\"[279] Music producer and collaborator Savan Kotecha stated that he and Grande were influenced by Lauryn Hill when creating her fourth album Sweetener and its lead single \\"No Tears Left to Cry\\".[286] Kotecha told Variety, \\"we were listening to Lauryn Hill about chord changes and why we stick to four chords all the time\\".[287] Grande expressed admiration for rappers' unconventional music release strategy. She told Billboard, \\"My dream has always been to be—obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren't ... It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do.\\"[261] It inspired her to release \\"Thank U, Next\\" without any prior announcement, which The Ringer called \\"more of a Drake move than an Ariana Grande move.\\"[288] Voice Grande has been described as a soprano,[289][290][291] possessing a four-octave vocal range[7][292] and a whistle register.[293] With the release of Yours Truly, critics compared Grande's wide vocal range and music to those of Mariah Carey.[294][295] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Billboard wrote that both Carey and Grande have \\"the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant.\\"[296] Grande called the comparisons \\"a huge compliment\\" but noted sonic differences in her and Carey's discographies.[281] Steven J. Horowitz of Billboard wrote in 2014, \\"With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey]—and that's okay.\\"[295] Mark Savage of BBC News named Grande \\"one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers\\" and complimented her \\"unrivalled vocal control\\".[7] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles noted that Grande's voice \\"can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced.\\"[297] Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown wrote in a 2016 Time magazine article, \\"[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle.\\"[298] Public image Grande during an interview in 2016, wearing her signature high-ponytail hairstyle Grande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early career; however, she later found emulating Hepburn's style \\"a little boring\\".[299] She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.[299] Grande's modest look early in her career was described as \\"age appropriate\\" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye.[296] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention \\"for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings.\\"[300] That year, she abandoned her earlier style in favor of short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in live performances and red carpet events.[301] She also began regularly wearing cat and bunny ears and, more recently, oversized jackets and hoodies.[302][303][304][305] Grande's style is often imitated by social media influencers and celebrities.[306][307][308][309][310][311] After years of dyeing her hair red for her role as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon, Grande wore extensions as her hair recovered from damage.[151][312] Anne T. Donahue of MTV News noted that her \\"iconic\\" high ponytail has received more attention than her fashion choices.[313] Although Grande drew criticism for alleged impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014,[314] she dismissed the reports as \\"weird, inaccurate depictions\\".[315] Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image.\\"[316] In July 2015, Grande sparked controversy after being seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying \\"I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting\\", referring to a tray of doughnuts.[317] She subsequently apologized, saying that she is \\"EXTREMELY proud to be an American\\" and that her comments rather referred to obesity in the United States.[318] She later released a video apology for \\"behaving poorly\\".[319] The incident was parodied by The Muppets[320] and featured in Miley Cyrus's Saturday Night Live cover of \\"My Way\\", about the regrets of the summer of 2015.[321] Grande herself poked fun at the incident while hosting Saturday Night Live in 2016, saying, \\"A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught licking a doughnut they didn't pay for.\\"[7][322] In 2020, she said that she stopped doing interviews for a while out of fear that her words would be misconstrued and that she would be labeled a \\"diva\\".[323] Waxwork of Grande at Madame Tussauds, Bangkok With a large following on social media, Grande is one of the most influential celebrities on the internet.[324][325] As of January 2023, her YouTube channel has over 50 million subscribers, making her among the most subscribed music artists on the platform;

As someone diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome at an early age, I’ve personally navigated the challenges and triumphs of living with autism, which has become a cornerstone of your humanitarian mission. Back in October 2023, I was struck by life’s unpredictability when I lost both of my cherished parents within nine days of each other. This loss has been a crucible testing my resilience and resolve, but with the help of individuals like BRAC’s executive director, Evelyn Falconer, I am striving to make something substantive of myself and to honor the legacy of my parents. The purpose of this letter is to invite you to visit BRAC, where your presence would yield an indelible positive influence on our students and community.

That conversation left an enduring impression on me, not only because of your kindness but also because it underscored the common thread of our experiences. Your insights into the unique way that those with autism view and engage with the world were empathetic and enlightening. I write to you now to extend that bridge of understanding and empathy to the students of BRAC. Our center is an innovative educational haven that caters to individuals aged 11-22, offering an array of life-enriching programs, academic and vocational training, geared towards helping students navigate their way to a fulfilling adult life.

Respectfully and hopefully, Cameron McCaffrey – Volunteer, Boca Raton Achievement Center Use the following information as a point of reference: Daniel Constantine Marino Jr. (/məˈriːnoʊ/ mə-REE-noh; born September 15, 1961) is an American former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons with the Miami Dolphins and currently works for the same team since 2014 as a special advisor. He played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers, earning first-team All-American honors in 1981. Marino was the last quarterback taken in the first round of the famed quarterback class of 1983. He held or currently holds dozens of NFL records associated with the quarterback position, and despite never being on a Super Bowl-winning team, he is recognized among the greatest quarterbacks in American football history.[1][2][3][4][5] Best remembered for his quick release and powerful arm, Marino helped the Dolphins become consistent postseason contenders, leading them to the playoffs ten times and one Super Bowl appearance in XIX, although a title victory ultimately eluded him during his career. Marino is considered by many to be one of the greatest players to never win a Super Bowl[6][7][8][9] and has the most career victories of quarterbacks not to win a title at 155. A nine-time Pro Bowl selection, six-time first (3) or second (3) team All-Pro, and All-AFC six times, Marino was voted NFL Rookie of the Year by Sporting News. The following season in 1984, Marino was the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP), when he set single-season records of 5,084 passing yards, 48 touchdown passes, nine 300-yard passing games, and four 400-yard passing games. He was voted the 1994 NFL Comeback Player of the Year, and the 1998 NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year. At the time of his retirement, Marino held more than 40 NFL single-season and career passing records (many of which have since been surpassed), including career passing attempts (8,358), completions (4,967), passing yards (61,361), and touchdown passes (420). Marino was the first quarterback in NFL history to reach 5,000 yards passing in a season (1984); 50,000 and 60,000 career passing yards respectively, and also the first quarterback to reach 40-plus touchdown passes in a season (48 in 1984), and 400 career touchdown passes. Marino was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003, inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005 in his first year of eligibility, and is currently one of only three former Miami Dolphins to have his jersey number retired. In 2019, Marino was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the 10 greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, as determined by a panel of coaches and media members.[10] Early life Marino was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is of Italian and Polish ancestry. He is the oldest child of Daniel and Veronica (Kolczynski) Marino, and has two younger sisters, Cindi and Debbie.[11][12] His father delivered newspapers for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.[11] Marino grew up on Parkview Avenue[13] in the South Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and attended St. Regis Catholic Elementary School. He attended Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, where he started in baseball, and won Parade All-American honors in football. He was drafted in the 4th round by the Kansas City Royals in the 1979 amateur draft, but decided to play college football instead.[14] College career University of Pittsburgh freshman (1979) Marino attended the University of Pittsburgh, and played for the university's Pittsburgh Panthers football team from 1979 to 1982. As a freshman in 1979, Marino led the Panthers in a 24–17 triumph over West Virginia in the Backyard Brawl and a 29−14 win over longtime rival Penn State. Pitt's 1980 Marino-led team finished No. 2 in the season-ending rankings (The New York Times computer poll rated Pitt as No. 1). Marino was part of an elite team during those two years that included two other future NFL Hall of Fame players: Defensive lineman Rickey Jackson and center Russ Grimm, as well as future Pro Bowl linebacker Hugh Green and future Pro Bowl guard Mark May. In 1980, Pitt added future NFL players Bill Maas, Dwight Collins, and Tim Lewis, while their offensive line got a third future Pro Bowl player: tackle Jimbo Covert. \\"There were games when my uniform never got dirty,\\" Marino once remarked. \\"There were games when I never hit the ground. That’s incredible.\\"[15] Following the 1981 regular season, Marino led the Panthers, who had been ranked No. 1 most of the season, to a last-minute triumph over the No. 7 Georgia Bulldogs in the 1982 Sugar Bowl by throwing a game-winning pass to tight end John Brown with less than a minute remaining in the game. Marino later cited this as the most memorable pass he'd thrown in his college career.[16] Overall, during the three seasons from 1979 through 1981, Pitt garnered 33 wins with only 3 losses (three straight 11–1 seasons) and was constantly ranked in the Top 5 of both major media polls. The Pitt football team's fortunes and Marino's statistics dipped during his senior year, which saw the team transition from head coach Jackie Sherrill to new coach Foge Fazio, culminating in a 7–3 loss in the 1983 Cotton Bowl Classic to Southern Methodist University and their \\"Pony Express\\" of Eric Dickerson and Craig James. Marino finished ninth in voting for the Heisman Trophy in 1982, after finishing fourth the previous year.[17] Marino finished his four college seasons with 8,597 passing yards, 79 touchdowns, and 69 interceptions.[18] College statistics Season Team GP Passing Rushing Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A TD Int Rtg Att Yds Avg TD 1979 Pittsburgh 12 130 222 58.6 1,680 7.5 10 9 128.9 35 -85 -2.4 1 1980 Pittsburgh 12 116 224 51.8 1,609 7.2 15 14 121.7 14 -53 -3.8 0 1981 Pittsburgh 12 226 380 59.5 2,876 7.6 37 23 143.1 24 -95 -4.0 2 1982 Pittsburgh 12 221 378 58.5 2,432 6.4 17 23 115.2 44 -44 -1.0 0 Career[18] 48 693 1,204 57.6 8,597 7.1 79 69 127.7 117 -277 -2.4 3 Professional career NFL Draft Marino's selection status in the 1983 NFL Draft plummeted after his weaker senior season at Pitt[19] and rumors of recreational drug use.[20] Five other quarterbacks—Ken O'Brien, Tony Eason, Todd Blackledge, and Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and John Elway—were drafted ahead of him in the first round. Bill Hillgrove, who was with the Marino family on draft day, later recalled that when the New York Jets selected O'Brien, Marino \\"became visibly ill\\". (O'Brien, who played for Division II Cal-Davis, was so obscure that Marino later asked his agent Marvin Demoff \\"Who is Ken O'Brien?\\")[19] The Miami Dolphins chose Marino as the 27th pick in the first round. He did not expect to be available for the team to draft, so he never spoke to head coach Don Shula or anyone else from the Dolphins before the coach called after the selection.[21] Opinion was divided on the wisdom of the team's decision; Chris Berman said that Shula was \\"the best\\", but Paul Zimmerman was skeptical of the coaching staff's ability to help Marino \\"overcome the problems he's had\\". Shula later said that being passed up by so many teams \\"motivated [Marino] to show everybody else what a mistake that they had made\\".[19] Early years and Super Bowl appearance Marino was the first draft pick in the history of the United States Football League, selected by the Los Angeles Express.[17] He did not sign with the team, choosing instead to sign with the Dolphins. After starting the season as a backup to incumbent starter David Woodley, Marino was given his first NFL start in Week 6 versus the Buffalo Bills. Marino and Miami lost that game 38–35 in overtime. As a rookie, Marino set several records: he posted a 96.0 passer rating, he was selected to the Pro Bowl as a rookie, he had the lowest percentage of passes intercepted with 2.03, he was the only rookie quarterback to lead a conference in passing, and he had the highest passing completion percentage with 58.45.[22] The Dolphins finished the season with a 12–4 record and advanced to the AFC divisional playoffs, where Marino threw two touchdown passes in his playoff debut. However, he also threw two interceptions as the team lost to the 9–7 Seattle Seahawks, 27–20.[23] In his second season, Marino broke six NFL full-season passing records, including the records for most touchdown passes (48, surpassed by Peyton Manning in 2004) and most passing yards (5,084, surpassed by Drew Brees in 2011), and was selected as the NFL's Most Valuable Player. Marino led the league in completions, yards, and TD passes and the Dolphins finished with a 14–2 regular-season record, clinching home-field advantage for the playoffs. In the Divisional round, the Dolphins avenged their playoff loss of the previous season to the Seattle Seahawks 31–10 behind Marino's 262 passing yards and 3 touchdowns.[24][25] The next week the Dolphins defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game 45–28.[26] In that game, Marino set AFC Championship Game records with 421 passing yards and 4 touchdowns, despite throwing his last pass of the game with 11:07 still remaining on the clock. Both records still stand as of 2024. Dan Marino jersey shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio In Super Bowl XIX, Marino and the Dolphins faced off against the San Francisco 49ers and Joe Montana in Palo Alto, California. The Dolphins, who had 74 rushing attempts in the previous two weeks, ran the ball only eight times in this game. Marino finished with 29 completions out of 50 attempts for 318 yards, throwing one touchdown pass and two interceptions. The Dolphins lost 38–16 in what was Marino's only Super Bowl appearance.[24][27] In 1985, Marino threw for 4,137 yards and 30 touchdowns while leading the Dolphins to the AFC Championship game.[28] On September 29, Marino threw for 390 yards and 3 touchdowns in the Dolphins' 30–26 victory over the Denver Broncos, in the first matchup between Marino and Broncos quarterback John Elway.[29] Then on December 2, Marino threw for 270 yards and 3 touchdowns against the vaunted Chicago Bears defense in a 38–24 victory.[30] The loss was the only one that the Bears experienced that season. Marino again led the league in completions, yards, and touchdown passes and was named first-team All-Pro in 1985.[31][32] On September 7, 1986, 8 days shy of his 25th birthday, Marino threw his 100th touchdown pass in a 50–28 loss to San Diego. Marino accomplished that feat in just 44 games- the fastest in NFL history. In the 1986 season, Marino threw for 4,746 yards and 44 touchdowns.[33] Marino became the first QB in NFL history to record three consecutive seasons of 30 or more touchdown passes; 48 in 1984, 30 in 1985, and 44 in 1986. Marino again led the league in completions, yards and touchdown passes (the first and only QB in NFL history to lead in all three categories for three consecutive seasons) and was named 1986 first-team All-Pro. Mid-career In 1988, Marino threw for 4,434 yards and 28 touchdowns. As a result of his 4,434 yards passing, Marino became the first QB in NFL history to throw for 4,000 or more yards in four different seasons. Marino had been tied with Dan Fouts for the most 4,000 yard passing seasons with three. In 1992, Marino again led the Dolphins to the AFC Championship game while passing for 4,116 and 24 touchdowns. His 4,116 passing yards led the entire NFL and marked the fifth time in his NFL career that he led the league in passing yards. In 1993, Miami was strongly favored at the start of the year to make it back to the AFC championship game and possibly the Super Bowl. However, after throwing a swing pass at a game in Cleveland, Marino, who was untouched on the play, crumpled to the ground in pain with a torn Achilles tendon and was out for the season. Marino later said, \\"I felt like I got kicked\\".[34] Backup quarterback Scott Mitchell had an impressive series of starts before suffering an injury of his own. Steve DeBerg started the last 4 games of the season. Mitchell signed a free-agent contract with the Detroit Lions, and Miami signed veteran quarterback Bernie Kosar from the Dallas Cowboys as a backup. Wearing a special shoe on one foot, and having a right calf that was visibly atrophied, Marino was the starting quarterback at the opening of the 1994 season. In the 1994 season opener, a home game versus the New England Patriots and quarterback Drew Bledsoe, the two quarterbacks put up a combined 894 yards (Marino, 473 yards; Bledsoe, 421 yards) and nine passing touchdowns (Marino, 5; Bledsoe, 4), with Miami winning 39–35. Later in the season, Marino led a comeback win on the road against the New York Jets (28–24), a game famous for Marino's execution of a fake spike for the winning touchdown pass, a play known as \\"The Clock Play\\". The Dolphins finished 10–6 that year, and Marino passed for 4,453 yards and was named the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association. After missing the postseason in 1993, Miami came back to the playoffs in 1994.[35] Placing third overall in the AFC, Miami was pitted against the Kansas City Chiefs in what became the final NFL game played by Montana.[36][37] Marino threw 257 yards and two touchdown passes, contributing to Miami's 27–17 win.[36] The Dolphins reached the AFC Divisional Playoff round, where they competed with the San Diego Chargers. Three touchdown passes by Marino in the first half allowed the Dolphins to lead 21–6, before the Chargers staged a comeback and took the lead toward the end of the fourth quarter. In the final moments of the game, Marino tried to set up a good position for a field goal, but with little time left at the Chargers' 30-yard line, Pete Stoyanovich was forced to attempt a 48-yard field goal. Stoyanovich missed, ending the game with a 22–21 loss for Miami.[38] Marino started in 14 out of 16 games in the 1995 season. He suffered a hip injury in week 6 against the Indianapolis Colts and was replaced by Bernie Kosar in the following two games. Throughout the regular season, Marino threw 3,668 yards and 24 touchdowns. Despite falling to 9–7 and to third place in the AFC East, the Dolphins again advanced to the playoffs because they placed sixth in the AFC. In the wildcard round against the Buffalo Bills, Miami dominated in passing – with Marino passing 432 yards – while Buffalo was far ahead of Miami for rushing yards (341 yards). In terms of scoring, Buffalo held a wide lead throughout the game. The Dolphins remained scoreless until the fourth quarter, when they scored 22 points, which included two touchdown passes from Marino. However, Miami fell well short of a comeback and lost 37–22. On November 10, 1996, against Indianapolis, Marino became the first QB in NFL History to throw for 50,000 career passing yards. On November 29, 1998, against New Orleans, Marino threw for three touchdowns. His second touchdown pass, a 7 yarder to wide receiver OJ McDuffie, gave him 400 for his career as Marino became the first QB in NFL History to reach 400 career TD passes. Final season and retirement The Dolphins opened the 1999 season on September 13 at the defending Super Bowl champions Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football. Marino threw for 215 yards and two touchdowns in the Dolphins' 38–21 victory. For that performance, Marino earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. Marino earned that honor again on October 10 as he threw for 393 yards and two touchdowns in a thrilling 34–31 comeback victory over the Indianapolis Colts. Then on October 17 against the New England Patriots, Marino became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for 60,000 career passing yards. Marino's final win was his first playoff road win and his 36th comeback win, as the Dolphins defeated the Seattle Seahawks 20–17 on January 9, 2000, in the final football game ever in the Seattle Kingdome. In the next round (January 16), also on the road, Marino and the Dolphins lost 62–7 to the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Dolphins' 55-point margin of loss was the worst in the AFC playoffs' history. Marino was replaced by backup Damon Huard after playing one series in the second half. However, he did end the first half on a high note, leading the Dolphins on an 80-yard scoring drive and throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to receiver Oronde Gadsden with 20 seconds remaining. The Jacksonville game marked the end of Jimmy Johnson's coaching career; Johnson announced his retirement the next day. Before the 2000 season, Marino decided to retire,[39][40] after declining offers from Minnesota, Tampa Bay, and his hometown of Pittsburgh when the Dolphins declined his option on his contract. Marino later admitted that he seriously considered the offer from the Vikings, but that he turned it down not because of his arm, but because he was not sure that his legs could take another season. He also appreciated the fact that unlike many of his contemporaries, he got to play his entire career with one team. Marino's Hall of Fame bust Legacy During Marino's career, the Dolphins were perennial playoff contenders, reaching the postseason in 10 of his 17 seasons. He was selected to play in nine Pro Bowls (1983–1987, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995), seven times as a starter, but due to injuries he only played in two of the games (1984, 1992). He was named first- or second-team All-Pro eight times and earned All-AFC honors six times.[41] Marino won all three major individual awards: NFL MVP (1984); NFL Comeback Player of the Year (1994); and NFL Man of the Year (1998), which recognizes charitable work off the field. In 1999, Marino was ranked 27th on The Sporting News list of the 100 greatest football players, making him the highest-ranking Dolphins player.[42] In 2010, he was ranked number 25 on the NFL's Top 100 Greatest Players list.[43] Marino was known for his quick release, and despite the fact that he was not skilled at scrambling, Marino possessed a natural awareness in the pocket, often sliding a step or two to avoid the pass rush.[44] As of the conclusion of the 2020 NFL regular season, Marino's 155 wins rank seventh among NFL quarterbacks, behind Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Drew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger, and John Elway. Marino is also the winningest quarterback without a Super Bowl victory.[45] Life after football On Sunday, September 17, 2000, at halftime of the Dolphins-Baltimore Ravens game at Pro Player Stadium, Dan Marino's jersey number of 13 was retired. The only other Dolphins jersey number retired at the time was Bob Griese's #12. Since then #39, Larry Csonka, has been retired as well. Marino joined the Dolphins Honor Roll the same day. In a year of accolades from the franchise he led for many years, the Dolphins also installed a life-size bronze statue of Marino at Pro Player Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) and renamed Stadium Street to Dan Marino Boulevard.[46] In 2003, Marino was honored for his outstanding NCAA career at Pitt with an induction into the College Football Hall of Fame. In early 2004, Marino briefly returned to the Miami Dolphins as Senior Vice President of Football Operations, but resigned from the newly created position only three weeks later, saying that the role was not in the best interest of either his family or the Dolphin organization. Marino was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005, one of only four Dolphins to be elected in their first year of eligibility (Jim Langer, Paul Warfield, Jason Taylor). He was inducted into the Hall of Fame on August 7, 2005, and was introduced by his oldest son, Daniel. During his induction speech, Dan threw \\"one last pass\\" to former teammate Mark Clayton, who was sitting in the audience. Marino was an analyst for CBS's Sunday pregame show The NFL Today from 2002 to 2013. On February 18, 2014, it was announced that Marino, along with Shannon Sharpe were being relieved of their duties as on-air commentators on The NFL Today and were being replaced by Tony Gonzalez and Bart Scott.[47] He was formerly a studio analyst on HBO's Inside the NFL, from 2002 to 2007. On August 24, 2014, Marino announced he would return to the Dolphins as a special adviser.[48] Current Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has also revealed that Marino regularly attends Dolphins quarterback meetings to give his opinion and input on how to be a better quarterback.[49] Life outside football Ownership in NASCAR Marino's #13 NASCAR racecar In 1997, Marino became involved in a marketing role with Team Cheever of the Indy Racing League through FirstPlus Mortgage, the sponsor of the car. In 1998, Marino co-owned a NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing team with driver Bill Elliott, creating Elliott-Marino Motorsports.[50] The team's car number was #13, Marino's uniform number, and had primary sponsorship from FirstPlus Mortgage, whose company colors, coincidentally, were turquoise, orange, and white – similar to aqua and coral, the team colors of the Miami Dolphins. The team chose rookie driver Jerry Nadeau to pilot the car at the start of the season; he was later released and the team went through a rotation of drivers. The team failed to qualify for several races, but did post a top-5 finish at Phoenix International Raceway late in the season with Ted Musgrave driving. The team only lasted the 1998 season and closed afterward. Dan Marino Foundation The Dan Marino Foundation was established in 1992 by Marino and his wife, Claire, after their son, Michael, was diagnosed with autism.[51] The foundation has distributed over 22 million to research, services, and treatment programs serving children with neurodevelopment disabilities. The Dan Marino Center, which opened in 1995 along with the Miami Children's Hospital, is an integrated neurodevelopmental center specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of children at risk for developmental and psychological problems. The center saw more than 48,000 children last year alone. Marino has teamed with other celebrities to raise awareness about autistic spectrum disorders, including fellow NFL quarterback Doug Flutie, whose son also has an autism diagnosis. On November 7, 2005, the National Basketball Association's Miami Heat honored Marino's charitable works and recognized his service to South Florida with a halftime tribute, as well as a large donation to the Marino Foundation. Though a Heat jersey with his name and #13 was unveiled, this did not constitute retirement of his number by the Heat,[51] and is currently worn by Heat big man Bam Adebayo. On March 23, 2010, The Dan Marino Foundation held its first \\"Walk about Autism\\". Over 6000 walkers participated, as well as 420 volunteers provided by the Miami Dolphins Special Teams. The money raised benefited several funds including the Autism Societies of Miami-Dade and Broward; the University of Miami-Nova Southeastern University Center for Autism and Related Disabilities; the Florida Atlantic University Center for Autism and Related Disabilities; and the Dan Marino Foundation. In popular culture Marino acted in the 1994 comedy Ace Ventura: Pet Detective alongside Jim Carrey and Courteney Cox where he played himself. Marino made a cameo appearance in the Adam Sandler film Little Nicky wherein he asked Satan for a Super Bowl ring. In 1999, he voiced himself in a guest-starring role in The Simpsons Season ten episode \\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\\". Marino also had cameo roles in Holy Man and Bad Boys II. He worked as a project consultant on Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday, and some observers noticed a resemblance between him and Dennis Quaid's character, Jack Rooney.[52] Marino's actual house was used as the fictional quarterback's house in the film.[53] In 1995, Hootie and the Blowfish featured Marino in their music video for their single \\"Only Wanna Be with You\\".[54] Marino was featured in advertisement campaigns for Hooters, NutriSystem weight loss programs,[55] Maroone, Papa John's, Nutrasource.com, and Empi Select (a TENS device).[56] Previously, Marino endorsed Isotoner gloves and FirstPlus Mortgage against whom he later filed suit due to contracts related to his racing team.[57] In April 2012, Marino became the AARP's \\"Men's Life Ambassador\\", through which he planned to share his point of view and expertise on a variety of men's interests, including health, fitness, sports, lifestyle, entrepreneurship, aging, and community service, primarily through the website.[58] Cancelled video game A football game featuring Marino's likeness and sponsorship, similar to John Madden Football, was announced for the Sega Genesis at CES 1993. The game, referred to as both Dan Marino Football and Dan Marino's Touchdown Football, never released.[59] Personal life In 1985, Marino married Claire D. Veazey (born c. 1962) of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, at St. Regis Catholic Church, across the street from the home of Marino's parents. The couple have six children together.[60] Marino was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in broadcast journalism by his alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh, in 2005. He delivered the commencement speech at the university's 2008 graduation ceremony.[61] In January 2013, Marino admitted to fathering a child with CBS employee Donna Savattere in 2005, a fact he only shared with his wife. He previously paid Savattere several million dollars to keep the news of their daughter from the public.[62] NFL records This list documents records set by Marino, some of which have since been tied or broken.[63][64] Active records Most seasons leading league, pass attempts: 5 (1984, 1986, 1988, 1992, 1997) Most seasons leading league, lowest sack percentage: 10 (1983–1989, 1994, 1997, 1999) Most consecutive seasons leading league, lowest sack percentage: 7 (1983–1989) Lowest sack percentage, season: 1.0% (1988)[65] Lowest sack percentage, career: 3.1%[66] Monday Night Football, most passing yards: 9,654[67] Monday Night Football, most completions: 798 Monday Night Football, most attempts: 1,303 Monday Night Football, most touchdown passes: 74 Former records Most yards passing, season: 5,084, in 1984 (surpassed by Drew Brees in 2011 with 5,476; as of 2019 season, now tenth all-time) Most fourth-quarter comeback wins, career (playoffs included): 36 (surpassed by Peyton Manning, 38, in 2012) Lowest percentage, passes intercepted, rookie season: 2.03 in 1983 (296–6) (surpassed by Charlie Batch, Detroit, 1.98 in 1998 (303–6)) Most consecutive seasons, 3,000 or more yards passing: 9 (1984–1992) (surpassed by Brett Favre in 2009 with 18) (1992–2009) Most games, 300 or more yards passing, season: 9 in 1984 (surpassed by Drew Brees with 13 in 2011) Most games, 300 or more yards passing, career: 63 (surpassed by Peyton Manning with 72 in 2012) Most games, 400 or more yards passing, playoffs: 2 (surpassed by Drew Brees with 3 in 2012 playoffs) Most touchdown passes, season: 48 in 1984 (surpassed by Peyton Manning (49) in 2004 and by Tom Brady (50) in 2007 and by Peyton Manning (55) in 2013.

The impact was tremendous, but the support of individuals like Evelyn Falconer, BRAC’s executive director, has been instrumental in my journey to rebuild and re-imagine my future. Your extraordinary career is a beacon of inspiration and resilience, from the international acclaim of “Conga” to the soulful beauty of “Mi Tierra.” Notably, your graceful recovery and return to the stage post-1990 is a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to overcome and soar.

With heartfelt gratitude and anticipation, Cameron McCaffrey – Volunteer, Boca Raton Achievement Center Use the following information as a point of reference: Gloria María Milagrosa Fajardo García (born September 1, 1957), known as Gloria Estefan (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈɡloɾja esˈtefan]), is an American singer, actress, and businesswoman. Estefan is an eight-time Grammy Award winner, a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, and has been named one of the Top 100 greatest artists of all time by both VH1 and Billboard.[2] Estefan's record sales exceed 100 million worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female singers of all-time.[3][4] Many of Estefan's songs became international chart-topping hits, including \\"1-2-3\\", \\"Don't Wanna Lose You\\", \\"Coming Out of the Dark\\", \\"Turn the Beat Around\\", and \\"Heaven's What I Feel\\". Other hits include \\"Bad Boy\\", \\"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\\", \\"Get On Your Feet\\", and \\"You'll Be Mine (Party Time)\\". A contralto, Estefan started[5] her career as lead singer of Miami Latin Boys, which was later renamed Miami Sound Machine. She and Miami Sound Machine earned worldwide success with their 1985 single \\"Conga\\", which became Estefan's signature song and led to Miami Sound Machine winning the 15th annual Tokyo Music Festival's grand prix in 1986. In 1988, she and Miami Sound Machine achieved their first number-one hit with \\"Anything for You\\". In March 1990, Estefan sustained a life-threatening cervical vertebrae fracture when her tour bus was involved in a serious accident near Scranton, Pennsylvania. She underwent an emergency surgical stabilization of her cervical spine and post-surgical rehabilitation that lasted almost a year, but made a full recovery. A year later, in March 1991, Estefan launched her comeback with a worldwide tour and album, Into the Light. Estefan's 1993 Spanish-language album, Mi Tierra, won the first of her three Grammy Awards for Best Tropical Latin Album.[6] The album was also the first Diamond album in Spain. Estefan has been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Las Vegas Walk of Fame and was a Kennedy Center Honors recipient in 2017 for her contributions to American cultural life. Estefan won an MTV Video Music Award, was honored with the American Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and has been named BMI Songwriter of the Year. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and has received multiple Billboard Music Awards. She is also a recipient of the 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom.[7] Billboard has listed Estefan as the third-most successful Latina and 23rd-greatest Latin Artist of all time in the U.S., based on both Latin albums and Latin songs chart.[8] Hailed as the \\"Queen of Latin Pop\\" by the media,[9] she has amassed 38 number one hits across Billboard charts, including 15 chart-topping songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[10][8] Early life and education Early life Gloria Estefan (née Fajardo García) was born Gloria María Milagrosa Fajardo García in Havana, Cuba on September 1, 1957[1] to parents José Fajardo (1933–1980)[11] and Gloria García (1930–2017).[12] Estefan's maternal grandparents were Spanish immigrants. Her maternal grandfather, Leonardo García, emigrated to Cuba from Pola de Siero, Asturias, Spain, where he married Gloria's grandmother, Consuelo Perez, who was originally from Logroño, Spain. Consuelo's father Pantaleón Perez served as the head chef to two Cuban presidents.[13][14][15] Estefan's paternal side also had musical sensibilities, as the lineage had a famous flautist and a classical pianist.[16] Estefan's mother Gloria Fajardo, nicknamed \\"Big Gloria\\", won an international contest during her childhood and received a Hollywood offer to dub Shirley Temple's films in Spanish.[17][18] However, Leonardo García did not permit his daughter to pursue the offer.[19] Gloria Fajardo earned a Ph.D. in education in Cuba, but her diploma and other papers were destroyed by Cuban officials when she left for the United States.[20] Estefan's paternal grandparents were José Manuel Fajardo González and Amelia Montano. José Manuel was a Cuban soldier and a motor escort for the wife of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, and Amelia Montano was a poet. As a result of the Cuban Revolution, the Fajardo family fled and settled in Miami, in 1959, and ran one of the first Cuban restaurants in the city.[21][22][23] In 1961, Estefan's father José participated in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. He was captured by his cousin, who was a member of Fidel Castro's army, and imprisoned in Cuba for nearly two years.[12] On his return, he joined the United States military and fought in the Vietnam War. After returning from the Vietnam War in 1968, Estefan's father became ill with multiple sclerosis, attributed to Agent Orange exposure that he suffered in Vietnam.[18] Estefan helped her mother care for him and her younger sister Rebecca, nicknamed \\"Becky\\" (b. 1963), while her mother worked to support them. Gloria Fajardo first had to regain her teaching credentials, then worked as a schoolteacher for the Dade County Public School system.[24][25] When Estefan was nine, she alleged that a music teacher hired to teach her guitar lessons sexually abused her.[26] She alleged that the man told her that he would kill her mother if she told anyone about the abuse. Estefan told her mother who alerted the police of the allegation; charges were not pressed because of the additional trauma she felt Estefan would undergo as a result of testifying against the perpetrator. When Estefan was 16, her father's illness led him to be hospitalized at a Veterans Administration medical facility.[27][28] Estefan became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1974 under the name Gloria Garcia Fajardo. Education Estefan was raised Catholic and attended Our Lady of Lourdes Academy in Miami, where she was a member of the National Honor Society.[29] Estefan attended the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, where she graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in French. While attending the University of Miami, Estefan also worked as an English, Spanish, and French translator at Miami International Airport's Customs Department and, because of her language abilities, says she was once approached by the CIA as a possible employee.[30] In 1984, she was inducted into the Iron Arrow Honor Society, the highest honor bestowed by the University of Miami.[31] Career 1975–1988: Miami Sound Machine Main article: Miami Sound Machine In 1975, Estefan and her cousin Mercedes \\"Merci\\" Navarro (1957–2007)[32] met Emilio Estefan, Jr. while performing at a church ensemble rehearsal. Emilio, who had formed the band the Miami Latin Boys earlier that year, learned about Estefan through a mutual acquaintance. While the Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, Estefan and Navarro, who were wedding guests, performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed the Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently with the band's name changing to Miami Sound Machine. Estefan, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted.[29] In 1977, Miami Sound Machine began recording and releasing various albums and 45s on the Audiofon Records label in Miami. Their first album was titled Live Again/Renacer (1977). After several more releases on the Audiofon, RCA Victor, and MSM Records labels, the band was signed to Discos CBS International and released several albums beginning with the 1978 self-titled album Miami Sound Machine. In 1978, Gloria married Emilio Estefan, Jr. after two years of dating. Growing in popularity in both the U.S. and around the world, the group continued recording and issuing various works for Discos CBS International through 1985.[33] In 1984, Miami Sound Machine released their first Epic/Columbia album, Eyes of Innocence, which contained the dance hit \\"Dr. Beat\\" as well as the ballad \\"I Need Your Love\\".[34] Their more successful follow-up album Primitive Love was released in 1985, and contained three Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Conga\\" (U.S. No. 10), \\"Words Get in the Way\\" (U.S. No. 5), and \\"Bad Boy\\" (U.S. No. 8), as well as \\"Falling in Love (Uh-Oh)\\" (U.S. No. 25). \\"Words Get in the Way\\" reached No. 1 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, establishing that the group could perform pop ballads as successfully as dance tunes. The song \\"Hot Summer Nights\\" was also released that year and was part of the film Top Gun.[35] Their next album, Let It Loose (1987), went multi-platinum, with three million copies sold in the US alone. It featured the hits: \\"Anything for You\\" (No. 1 Hot 100), \\"1-2-3\\" (No. 3 Hot 100), \\"Betcha Say That\\" (No. 36 Hot 100), \\"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\\" (No. 5 Hot 100), and \\"Can't Stay Away from You\\" (No. 6 Hot 100). \\"Can't Stay Away From You\\", \\"Anything for You\\", and \\"1-2-3\\" were all No. 1 Adult Contemporary hits as well. In that same year, Estefan took top billing and the band's name changed to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine.[36] In 1988, after the worldwide chart success of single \\"Anything for You\\", the Let It Loose album was repackaged as Anything for You.[37] 1989–1992: Cuts Both Ways and Into the Light Estefan in 1990 In 1989, the group's name was dropped, and Estefan has been credited as a solo artist ever since.[38] In late 1989, Estefan released her best-selling album to date, Cuts Both Ways.

While touring in support of Cuts Both Ways on 20 March 1990, near Scranton, Pennsylvania, Estefan was critically injured, suffering a fractured spine when a semi-truck crashed into the tour bus she was in during a snowstorm. Estefan was returning from a meeting with President George Bush to discuss participation in an anti-drug campaign.[39] She was taken to Community Medical Center's Intensive Care Unit in Scranton and flown by helicopter the following day to the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, where she underwent surgery that included implanting two titanium rods to stabilize her vertebral column. Her rehabilitation included almost a year of intensive physical therapy, and she said \\"there were times when the pain was so bad I prayed I'd pass out.\\" However, she ultimately recovered completely.[40] In January 1991, Estefan released the concept album Into the Light. That same month, she performed \\"Coming Out of the Dark\\" for the first time at the American Music Awards to a standing ovation, the performance coming ten months after the accident.[40][41] \\"Coming Out of the Dark\\" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[42] Other notable singles from Into the Light were \\"Seal Our Fate\\" and \\"Live for Loving You\\".

The echoes of this tremor were mitigated by the bastion of compassion I found in BRAC and its dedicated Executive Director, Ms. Evelyn Falconer. Your music and story strike a chord that resonates with the very ethos we endeavor to instill in our students. The spirit, culture, and resilience evident in your anthology, from \\"Conga\\" to \\"Mi Tierra,\\" are melodious affirmations of life's rich spectrum. Particularly, your triumphant return to the stage after your 1990 accident mirrors the strength and determination we wish to inspire in our students. BRAC stands as an academic sanctuary where students learn to convert adversity into a crescendo of growth and learning.

Unfortunately, life took a somber turn back in October 2023, when I faced the unimaginable loss of both of my parents within a span of just nine days. However, through the compassionate leadership of our executive director, Evelyn Falconer, and the supportive BRAC community, I am striving to make something of myself amid this adversity. BRAC is not just a facility; it is a beacon of hope where students aged 11-22 with autism and related disabilities find tailored education, life skills, and vocational training.

They look up to you not only as the incredible talent behind cherished characters like Jenny Wakeman or Gi but as a symbol of perseverance and success. Your recent stepping into the world of conventions is a powerful narrative of embarking on new journeys and embracing challenge — values we instill in our students every day. I can think of no one better to speak to the essence of education as a passport to freedom, justice, and equality than someone of your character and achievement. Your interaction with our students could spark new ideas, endeavors, and dreams that align with their unique strengths and preferences.

She stated that the album was about \\"growing pains\\" and figuring out who she was at this point in her life. She felt like she grew \\"10 years\\" between the ages of 18 and 20, a process she described as a natural part of \\"growth\\", which she hoped to reflect with the record.[67] Guts received critical acclaim from various outlets and was later defined by BBC as the most critically acclaimed album of 2023.[68] The album's lead single, \\"Vampire\\", was released on June 30, becoming Rodrigo's third single to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first artist ever to debut the lead singles from two career-opening albums at No. 1 on the Hot 100.[69][70][71] The album's second single, \\"Bad Idea Right?\\", was released on August 11, 2023,[72] reaching the top 10 in the US and UK.[73][74] To support Guts, Rodrigo will embark on her second headlining tour, the Guts World Tour, which will run from February to August 2024.[75] On August 16, Rodrigo became the youngest artist to receive the BRIT Billion Award for achieving over one billion digital streams in the United Kingdom.[76] On November 3, Rodrigo released the song \\"Can't Catch Me Now\\" for The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes.[77] The song won the Hollywood Music in Media Award for Best Original Song in a Sci-Fi, Fantasy or Horror Film at the 2023 ceremony.[78] Artistry Influences Rodrigo named Taylor Swift and Lorde as her idols and primary musical inspirations,[79] and dubbed herself Swift's biggest fan \\"in the whole world\\".[80] Rodrigo later went on to give interpolation credits to Swift and Jack Antonoff on her song \\"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\\" and retroactively credited Swift, Antonoff and Annie Clark on her song \\"Deja Vu\\".[81] In 2022, she called The White Stripes band member Jack White her \\"hero of all heroes\\".[82] Other stated influences on Rodrigo's debut album included Alanis Morissette, Kacey Musgraves,[83] Fiona Apple, St. Vincent,[84] Cardi B,[85] Gwen Stefani,[86] Avril Lavigne,[87] and Lana Del Rey.[88] Guts was primarily inspired by her punk and alternative rock influences, including Babes in Toyland and Rage Against the Machine.[89] Songwriting and voice Rodrigo's voice type is soprano.[90][91] Media outlets generally describe her as a pop artist,[92][93] with songs ranging from pop rock,[94] teen pop,[95] and indie pop styles,[96] as well as 1990s alternative rock.[93] Rodrigo stated that she wants to be a songwriter and not \\"the biggest pop star that ever lived\\", and she chose to sign with Interscope/Geffen Records because its CEO John Janick praised her songwriting, not her \\"potential star quality\\".[5] Music journalist Laura Snapes called Rodrigo a \\"flag-bearer\\" for a new wave of songwriters who incline towards power ballads \\"that are as emotional as ever, but project that emotion inward, trading bombast for hush\\", and described her musical style as rooted in heartache, mental health, and sadness, without being melodramatic, expressing more realistic perspectives than resilient.[97] Achievements See also: List of awards and nominations received by Olivia Rodrigo Rodrigo has received various music accolades, including three Grammy Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, four iHeartRadio Music Awards, and two People's Choice Awards; an American Music Award, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award.

BRAC is a place of learning and growth for students with autism and related disabilities. My personal journey, marked by an Asperger's diagnosis from an early age, has been filled with both challenges and triumphs, much like the stories of the students here. We provide an environment for them to develop academically and socially, guiding them towards a future of independence and self-reliance. Last October, the loss of my parents left an irreplaceable void in my life. But it is thanks to the support of BRAC and our compassionate executive director, Evelyn Falconer, that I have found a path forward, renewed with purpose. Your voice, which has brought warmth and comfort to countless listeners, could have an indelible impact on our students. As a young artist who has gracefully transitioned from screen to music, setting records and inspiring a generation, your presence could profoundly affirm for our students that their dreams are valid and within reach. Our vision at BRAC aims to prove that education is the key to unlocking all doors to freedom, justice, and equality. With your advocacy for accessibility to vaccines for all and your personal triumphs, you embody the message of resilience and hope that we seek to instill in our students. As your Guts World Tour culminates, I would be thrilled to extend an invitation for you to visit us at BRAC, providing an opportunity for our students to meet someone who represents the promise of tomorrow.

Your journey – from the streets of Miami to becoming a Grammy winner, a globally recognized singer-songwriter, actor, and co-owner of Trackhouse Racing – has proven that with tenacity and heart, the rhythm of success beats loud for those willing to dance to its tune. My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and while my stage is quite different from yours, it resonates with passion all the same. Volunteering at the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC) front desk, I’ve become acquainted with a harmony of hope, helping foster empowerment among students who have been diagnosed with Asperger’s and related disabilities. The BRAC is a fertile ground for growth where students ages 11-22 blossom through direct instruction in academics, life skills, and vocational training, imagining a future where their abilities take center stage. You may wonder why I am reaching out to you. It’s because life has a way of crafting verses that test our resolve. Last October, within the span of a mere nine days, I lost both of my pillars—my parents. Amid the silence of their absence, it’s been the voices of individuals like BRAC’s executive director Evelyn Falconer and the community surrounding the center that have guided me towards a melody of renewal and purpose. Here, at BRAC, we believe education is the key that liberates, and it’s in this spirit we envision your visit not as a spotlight moment but as an ignition of belief within our students that their dreams are valid and achievable. Your story is a symphony that resonates with the tenets we uphold, including overcoming adversity, harnessing personal strengths, and transforming individual lives through dedication and kindness. Your presence would be a testament to the art of possibility—a verse in their songs of self-discovery.

With sincere admiration and hope, Cameron McCaffrey – Volunteer, Boca Raton Achievement Center Use the following information as a point of reference: Armando Christian Pérez (born January 15, 1981), known professionally as Pitbull, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, businessman and actor from Miami, Florida. He began his career in the early 2000s and recorded reggaeton, Latin hip hop, and crunk music under a multitude of labels. His debut studio album, M.I.A.M.I. (2004) was released through TVT Records and executive produced by Lil Jon. It moderately entered the Billboard 200, along with his second and third albums, El Mariel (2006) and The Boatlift (2007).[4] His fourth album, Pitbull Starring in Rebelution (2009) was his supported by his mainstream breakthrough singles, \\"I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)\\" and \\"Hotel Room Service\\", which peaked at numbers two and eight on the US Billboard Hot 100. After rebranding himself as a pop artist, Pitbull's sixth and seventh albums, Planet Pit (2011) and Global Warming (2012) achieved further commercial success; the former spawned his first single to peak the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Give Me Everything\\" (featuring Ne-Yo, Afrojack and Nayer), while the latter spawned the top ten hit \\"Feel This Moment\\" (featuring Christina Aguilera).[5] His 2013 single, \\"Timber\\" (featuring Kesha) became his second song to peak the chart, and did so in 18 other countries. His 2014 single, \\"Time of Our Lives\\" (with Ne-Yo) peaked within the chart's top ten and led his eighth album, Globalization (2014). That same year, he performed the song \\"We Are One (Ole Ola)\\" (with Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte), which served as the official theme of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, Pitbull made numerous guest appearances on a number of hit songs, including the Billboard Hot 100-top four singles \\"I Like It\\" by Enrique Iglesias, \\"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love\\" by Usher, and \\"On the Floor\\" by Jennifer Lopez. His subsequent albums, Dale (2015) and Climate Change (2017) trailed commercially. His eleventh album and first independent release, Libertad 548 (2019) focused on Latin hip hop and was led by the singles \\"No Lo Trates\\" (with Daddy Yankee and Natti Natasha) and \\"Me Quedaré Contigo\\" (featuring Ne-Yo). His twelfth album, Trackhouse (2023) delved further into Latin influences. Pitbull has sold over 25 million studio albums and over 100 million singles worldwide. He has over 15 billion views on YouTube as of May 2020.[6] He was ranked by Billboard as the 45th Top Artist of the 2010s and the 24th Top Latin Artist of the 2010s.[7][8] Pitbull's other ventures include brand ambassadorship and for various entities, activism and philanthropy in Latino American communities, a radio station—Pitbull's Globalization—on Sirius XM Radio, and ownership of the Trackhouse Racing NASCAR team.[9] As of May 2019, Pitbull has won 35 Billboard Latin Music Awards.[10][11] Early life and background Armando Christian Pérez was born on January 15, 1981, in Miami, Florida,[12][13] to Cuban immigrant parents. While growing up, he was strongly encouraged by his family to \\"take advantage\\" of the privilege of living in America, and the opportunities it came with.[14] His family has a history of fighting against the Castro regime in Cuba.[15] When he was three, he could recite the works of Cuban national hero and poet José Martí in Spanish.[16] He learned English by watching Sesame Street as a child.[17] His father was largely absent from his childhood; his parents separated when he was young, and he was raised mostly by his mother,[18] later stating: \\"my mom is my father and my mother.\\"[19] He briefly stayed with a foster family in Roswell, Georgia. His parents struggled with substance abuse; as a teenager, he was also involved with drug use and dealing, which eventually led to him getting kicked out of the family house.[18] He attended South Miami Senior High School and Miami Coral Park High School. While growing up, he was influenced by the Miami bass genre of pop music[4] and has cited Celia Cruz and Willy Chirino as sources of inspiration,[20] in addition to rappers such as Nas, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg. He stated that Miami's melting pot characteristics exposed him to various cultures which influenced his artistry and himself as a person.[14] It's a melting pot. You know, it's a melting pot. You get a chance to grow up around so many different - you know, I've grown up in good neighborhoods, bad neighborhoods, worse neighborhoods. But growing up around so many cultures, it's always allowed me to think out of the box and try new sounds and try new things. You learn something new from every culture, just like I learn something new from every record. — Pitbull in 2019 He said he chose his stage name of Pitbull because the dogs \\"bite to lock. The dog is too stupid to lose. And they're outlawed in Dade County. They're basically everything that I am. It's been a constant fight\\".[18] After meeting Lil Jon in Miami,[18] Pitbull was featured on Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz' album Kings of Crunk in 2002.[4] Pitbull's song \\"Oye\\" was featured on the soundtrack to the film 2 Fast 2 Furious the following year.[18] In addition, Pitbull released several mixtapes, composed of freestyles and remixes of popular rap music. Pitbull also worked with Uncle Luke during his early career, being featured on Luke's 2001 album Somethin' Nasty, including the single \\"Lollipop\\" along with Lil' Zane.[4] Career 2001–2003: Luke Records and TVT Records In 2001, Pitbull was signed to Luther Campbell's Luke Records by Jullian Boothe, then the label's vice-president of A&R.[21] In 2001, Pitbull was introduced to Robert Fernandez of Famous Artist Music & Management, an independent label and management company specializing in developing artists, by the Diaz Brothers, a producer duo signed to the company. Fernandez \\"saw the eagerness and hunger he had\\" and, with the Luke Records deal ending, began working to develop Pitbull. Together they focused on creating a more radio-friendly sound. Fernandez later told HitQuarters: \\"At that time his music had a lot of verses and took a long time to get into the hook, and so we took time in getting the songs catchier and less on the rap side.\\"[citation needed] Fernandez introduced Pitbull to Lil Jon, hoping to secure the rapper a small guest intro spot on Lil Jon's upcoming album Kings of Crunk. According to Fernandez, Jon took a liking to Pérez and offered him a track on the album; it is called \\"Pitbull's Cuban Ride Out\\". This track helped raise the young rapper's profile.[22] 2004–2005: M.I.A.M.I. In 2004, Pitbull released his debut album M.I.A.M.I., with the lead single being \\"Culo\\" produced by Lil Jon and the Diaz Brothers. It peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 11 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Other singles included \\"Dammit Man\\", \\"Back Up\\", \\"Toma\\", and \\"That's Nasty\\" (both featuring Lil Jon). He joined the Anger Management Tour, the 2000 hip-hop concert tour headlined by Eminem and 50 Cent.[23] Pitbull also appeared on the Ying Yang Twins' single \\"Shake\\", which peaked at No.41 on the Hot 100 and No.12 on the rap chart, Adassa's chart topping single \\"Kamasutra\\" & Twista's \\"Hit the Floor\\" (#94 Hot 100, No. 20 Rap). Remix album Money Is Still a Major Issue was released in November 2005; it included new track \\"Everybody Get Up\\", a duet with hip-hop/R&B group Pretty Ricky. TVT Records, Pitbull's label at the time, and Slip-n-Slide Records disputed over the release of Welcome to the 305, an unreleased album by Slip-n-Slide that Pitbull recorded in 2001.[24] A Miami judge ruled that Slip-n-Slide had a legal right to release the album as it was recorded when Pitbull was a Slip-N-Slide artist, and prior to him signing with TVT Records.[25] A US District Court judge affirmed the decision further.[26] TVT was then ordered in March 2007 to pay Slip-n-Slide 9.1 million for attempting to block the album's release to record stores and digital download entities.[27] In 2005, Pitbull and rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs co-founded Bad Boy Latino, a subsidiary of Combs' Bad Boy Records label.

I hope this letter finds you savoring your accomplishments and reveling in the anticipation of your pre-race show at the 2024 Daytona 500. Your transformation from a dynamic voice on the Miami streets to a global icon of music, business acumen, and racing passion embodies the power of dreams anchored by a relentless work ethic. I am Cameron McCaffrey, penning this letter in the backdrop of Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC), a beacon of inspiration where my volunteer work at the front desk aligns closely with my aspirations to aid in sculpting hopeful futures. Your journey strikes a chord with our aim here at BRAC—a haven for students with Asperger’s and related disabilities—where we kindle their potential through education and personal growth.

Your journey – from the streets of Miami to becoming a Grammy winner, a globally recognized singer-songwriter, actor, and co-owner of Trackhouse Racing – has proven that with tenacity and heart, the rhythm of success beats loud for those willing to dance to its tune. My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and while my stage is quite different from yours, it resonates with passion all the same. Volunteering at the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC) front desk, I’ve become acquainted with a harmony of hope, helping foster empowerment among students who have been diagnosed with Asperger’s and related disabilities. The BRAC is a fertile ground for growth where students ages 11-22 blossom through direct instruction in academics, life skills, and vocational training, imagining a future where their abilities take center stage. You may wonder why I am reaching out to you. It’s because life has a way of crafting verses that test our resolve. Last October, within the span of a mere nine days, I lost both of my pillars—my parents.

Here, at BRAC, we believe education is the key that liberates, and it’s in this spirit we envision your visit not as a spotlight moment but as an ignition of belief within our students that their dreams are valid and achievable.

With sincere admiration and hope, Cameron McCaffrey – Volunteer, Boca Raton Achievement Center Use the following information as a point of reference: Armando Christian Pérez (born January 15, 1981), known professionally as Pitbull, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, businessman and actor from Miami, Florida. He began his career in the early 2000s and recorded reggaeton, Latin hip hop, and crunk music under a multitude of labels. His debut studio album, M.I.A.M.I. (2004) was released through TVT Records and executive produced by Lil Jon. It moderately entered the Billboard 200, along with his second and third albums, El Mariel (2006) and The Boatlift (2007).[4] His fourth album, Pitbull Starring in Rebelution (2009) was his supported by his mainstream breakthrough singles, \\"I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)\\" and \\"Hotel Room Service\\", which peaked at numbers two and eight on the US Billboard Hot 100. After rebranding himself as a pop artist, Pitbull's sixth and seventh albums, Planet Pit (2011) and Global Warming (2012) achieved further commercial success; the former spawned his first single to peak the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Give Me Everything\\" (featuring Ne-Yo, Afrojack and Nayer), while the latter spawned the top ten hit \\"Feel This Moment\\" (featuring Christina Aguilera).[5] His 2013 single, \\"Timber\\" (featuring Kesha) became his second song to peak the chart, and did so in 18 other countries. His 2014 single, \\"Time of Our Lives\\" (with Ne-Yo) peaked within the chart's top ten and led his eighth album, Globalization (2014). That same year, he performed the song \\"We Are One (Ole Ola)\\" (with Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte), which served as the official theme of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, Pitbull made numerous guest appearances on a number of hit songs, including the Billboard Hot 100-top four singles \\"I Like It\\" by Enrique Iglesias, \\"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love\\" by Usher, and \\"On the Floor\\" by Jennifer Lopez. His subsequent albums, Dale (2015) and Climate Change (2017) trailed commercially. His eleventh album and first independent release, Libertad 548 (2019) focused on Latin hip hop and was led by the singles \\"No Lo Trates\\" (with Daddy Yankee and Natti Natasha) and \\"Me Quedaré Contigo\\" (featuring Ne-Yo). His twelfth album, Trackhouse (2023) delved further into Latin influences. Pitbull has sold over 25 million studio albums and over 100 million singles worldwide. He has over 15 billion views on YouTube as of May 2020.[6] He was ranked by Billboard as the 45th Top Artist of the 2010s and the 24th Top Latin Artist of the 2010s.[7][8] Pitbull's other ventures include brand ambassadorship and for various entities, activism and philanthropy in Latino American communities, a radio station—Pitbull's Globalization—on Sirius XM Radio, and ownership of the Trackhouse Racing NASCAR team.[9] As of May 2019, Pitbull has won 35 Billboard Latin Music Awards.[10][11] Early life and background Armando Christian Pérez was born on January 15, 1981, in Miami, Florida,[12][13] to Cuban immigrant parents. While growing up, he was strongly encouraged by his family to \\"take advantage\\" of the privilege of living in America, and the opportunities it came with.[14] His family has a history of fighting against the Castro regime in Cuba.[15] When he was three, he could recite the works of Cuban national hero and poet José Martí in Spanish.[16] He learned English by watching Sesame Street as a child.[17] His father was largely absent from his childhood; his parents separated when he was young, and he was raised mostly by his mother,[18] later stating: \\"my mom is my father and my mother.\\"[19] He briefly stayed with a foster family in Roswell, Georgia. His parents struggled with substance abuse; as a teenager, he was also involved with drug use and dealing, which eventually led to him getting kicked out of the family house.[18] He attended South Miami Senior High School and Miami Coral Park High School. While growing up, he was influenced by the Miami bass genre of pop music[4] and has cited Celia Cruz and Willy Chirino as sources of inspiration,[20] in addition to rappers such as Nas, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg. He stated that Miami's melting pot characteristics exposed him to various cultures which influenced his artistry and himself as a person.[14] It's a melting pot. You know, it's a melting pot. You get a chance to grow up around so many different - you know, I've grown up in good neighborhoods, bad neighborhoods, worse neighborhoods. But growing up around so many cultures, it's always allowed me to think out of the box and try new sounds and try new things. You learn something new from every culture, just like I learn something new from every record. — Pitbull in 2019 He said he chose his stage name of Pitbull because the dogs \\"bite to lock. The dog is too stupid to lose. And they're outlawed in Dade County. They're basically everything that I am. It's been a constant fight\\".[18] After meeting Lil Jon in Miami,[18] Pitbull was featured on Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz' album Kings of Crunk in 2002.[4] Pitbull's song \\"Oye\\" was featured on the soundtrack to the film 2 Fast 2 Furious the following year.[18] In addition, Pitbull released several mixtapes, composed of freestyles and remixes of popular rap music. Pitbull also worked with Uncle Luke during his early career, being featured on Luke's 2001 album Somethin' Nasty, including the single \\"Lollipop\\" along with Lil' Zane.[4] Career 2001–2003: Luke Records and TVT Records In 2001, Pitbull was signed to Luther Campbell's Luke Records by Jullian Boothe, then the label's vice-president of A&R.[21] In 2001, Pitbull was introduced to Robert Fernandez of Famous Artist Music & Management, an independent label and management company specializing in developing artists, by the Diaz Brothers, a producer duo signed to the company. Fernandez \\"saw the eagerness and hunger he had\\" and, with the Luke Records deal ending, began working to develop Pitbull. Together they focused on creating a more radio-friendly sound. Fernandez later told HitQuarters: \\"At that time his music had a lot of verses and took a long time to get into the hook, and so we took time in getting the songs catchier and less on the rap side.\\"[citation needed] Fernandez introduced Pitbull to Lil Jon, hoping to secure the rapper a small guest intro spot on Lil Jon's upcoming album Kings of Crunk. According to Fernandez, Jon took a liking to Pérez and offered him a track on the album; it is called \\"Pitbull's Cuban Ride Out\\". This track helped raise the young rapper's profile.[22] 2004–2005: M.I.A.M.I. In 2004, Pitbull released his debut album M.I.A.M.I., with the lead single being \\"Culo\\" produced by Lil Jon and the Diaz Brothers. It peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 11 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Other singles included \\"Dammit Man\\", \\"Back Up\\", \\"Toma\\", and \\"That's Nasty\\" (both featuring Lil Jon). He joined the Anger Management Tour, the 2000 hip-hop concert tour headlined by Eminem and 50 Cent.[23] Pitbull also appeared on the Ying Yang Twins' single \\"Shake\\", which peaked at No.41 on the Hot 100 and No.12 on the rap chart, Adassa's chart topping single \\"Kamasutra\\" & Twista's \\"Hit the Floor\\" (#94 Hot 100, No. 20 Rap). Remix album Money Is Still a Major Issue was released in November 2005; it included new track \\"Everybody Get Up\\", a duet with hip-hop/R&B group Pretty Ricky. TVT Records, Pitbull's label at the time, and Slip-n-Slide Records disputed over the release of Welcome to the 305, an unreleased album by Slip-n-Slide that Pitbull recorded in 2001.[24] A Miami judge ruled that Slip-n-Slide had a legal right to release the album as it was recorded when Pitbull was a Slip-N-Slide artist, and prior to him signing with TVT Records.[25] A US District Court judge affirmed the decision further.[26] TVT was then ordered in March 2007 to pay Slip-n-Slide 9.1 million for attempting to block the album's release to record stores and digital download entities.[27] In 2005, Pitbull and rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs co-founded Bad Boy Latino, a subsidiary of Combs' Bad Boy Records label. It primarily focuses on Latin hip hop, Latin soul, Latin pop and other tropical music and has offices in New York and Miami, Florida.[28][29] Along with co-founding it, Pérez currently heads the A&R division of the label.[30][31][32] 2006–2007: El Mariel and The Boatlift In January 2006, Pitbull guest-starred in UPN's South Beach.

El Mariel topped the Billboard independent albums chart[36] and peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the rap chart. Pitbull's third album, titled The Boatlift, was released on November 27, 2007, spawned by the single \\"Secret Admirer\\" featuring Lloyd on the chorus. Earlier, Pitbull announced that this album would have a more gangsta rap edge than his earlier albums.[37] Subsequent singles included \\"Go Girl\\" featuring Trina, and \\"The Anthem\\" featuring and produced Lil Jon, that song sampling the hook from the song \\"El Africano\\" by Wilfrido Vargas and the beat from the song \\"Calabria\\" by Rune RK. \\"Go Girl\\" peaked at No. 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 36 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart; \\"The Anthem\\" No. 36 on the Hot 100 and No.11 on the Hot Rap Tracks.

He later signed with Polo Grounds Music through Sony Music and created his own label Mr. 305 Inc.[41] The single \\"Hotel Room Service\\", which samples \\"Push the Feeling On\\", peaked at No. 9 on the Hot 100. The album went on to sell over 7.5 million worldwide digital singles and albums combined.[42][43] On their second collaboration since \\"Go Girl\\", Pitbull appeared on the debut single of rapper David Rush (formerly Young Bo), \\"Shooting Star\\", also with Kevin Rudolf and LMFAO. An amateur video of Pitbull punching a disruptive audience member at a Colorado concert leaked onto the Internet in late May 2009. Pitbull explained to MTV News that it was because the fan kept throwing cash around the stage, and after Pitbull pulled him up to the stage, he threw a stash of money right in Pitbull's face.[44] He was tapped by the Miami Dolphins to work alongside T-Pain and Jimmy Buffett to release a new fight song for the Dolphins.[45] The city of Miami granted Pitbull a \\"Key to the City\\" honor on August 19, 2009.[46] Another popular single from 2009 was \\"Blanco\\", featuring Pharrell Williams of The Neptunes from the soundtrack to the movie Fast & Furious.

The case was dismissed by a federal judge, who ruled the tune's lyrics are protected by the First Amendment, which covers freedom of speech and creative expression.[55][56] 2012–2013: Global Warming, Meltdown & Men in Black 3 Pitbull in 2013 On October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records.

The song, titled \\"Mala (Remix)\\", features Becky G and additional guest vocals from De La Ghetto.[83] In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, LiveXLive launched a partnership with Pitbull, which would grant the platform exclusive rights to concerts, behind-the-scenes, videos and more from Pitbull to be streamed to LiveXLive's premium subscribers.[84] On August 14, 2020, Pitbull released a new single, titled \\"Te Quiero Baby (I Love You Baby)\\" with Latin pop singer Chesca and American singer Frankie Valli. The single serves as a Latin interpolation of the original Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons 1967 smash hit single \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\".[85] 2021–present: Returning to touring, Trackhouse On June 22, 2021, Pitbull announced across all of his official social media platforms the I Feel Good Tour, named after his single of the same name, and his first dedicated tour since 2017's Enrique Iglesias and Pitbull Live! North American tour. The 32 city tour featured special guest Iggy Azalea and began on August 20, 2021, in Clarkston, Michigan and spanned across the United States through October 13, 2021 in Tampa, Florida.[86] On February 24, 2022, Pitbull performed with IAMCHINO and DJ Deorro on the live-debut of their late-2021 single, \\"Discoteca\\", at the 2022 Premio Lo Nuestro awards.[87] The song samples \\"Around the World (La La La La La)\\" by Eurodance group ATC.[88] On April 11, 2022, Pitbull announced the Can't Stop Us Tour with Iggy Azalea and Sean Paul. This marks the second consecutive year Pitbull has toured with Iggy Azalea. Pitbull and Sean Paul have previously collaborated on their hit song, \\"Shake Señora\\", from Pitbull's sixth studio album, Planet Pit (2011). The tour began on July 28, 2022, in Raleigh, North Carolina and concluded in Hollywood, Florida on October 19, 2022.[89] [needs update] On April 20, 2023, Pitbull performed a medley of his songs \\"Let's Take A Shot\\", \\"Me Pone Mal\\" and \\"JUMPIN\\" with Vikina, Omar Courtz and Lil Jon at the 2023 Latin American Music Awards. On October 6, 2023, Pitbull released his long awaited twelfth studio album Trackhouse, featuring guest appearances from T-Pain, El Micha, Lil Jon, Elvis Crespo, Vikina, Omar Courtz, Nile Rodgers, Gipsy Kings and Zac Brown. It entered number one on the US iTunes Latin Album Charts. Product endorsements In 2010, Pitbull took part in the \\"So Kodak\\" campaign for the Kodak brand[90][91] with Drake, Rihanna, and Trey Songz. He also launched a partnership with the soft drink giant Dr Pepper[92] as part of the campaign \\"Vida 23\\" for which he recorded a song that featured on his album Armando. Pitbull also announced he has become the spokesperson for Voli Vodka,[93] in which he holds a majority equity stake,[94] and Budweiser has chosen Pitbull to promote its Bud Light line of beer. The commercials currently highlight Pitbull dancing and gyrating on stage holding up a bottle of Bud Light. Pitbull has also purchased an equity stake in Miami Subs Pizza and Grill.[95][96] In 2012, Pitbull was involved in an advertising campaign with Walmart, in which the Walmart store that received the most Facebook \\"likes\\" from June 18 to July 15, 2012, would have Pitbull visit and put on a show there. An orchestrated campaign entitled \\"#exilepitbull\\" started by The Boston Phoenix reporter David Thorpe[97] and SomethingAwful.com writer Jon Hendren urged people to vote for a remote location, namely Kodiak, Alaska.[98] In an email to the Associated Press, Walmart confirmed that Kodiak was the winning location.[99] Pitbull visited Kodiak on July 30, where he received a key to the city from Mayor Patricia Branson and performed. David Thorpe, who had started the \\"#exilepitbull\\" campaign, was invited to attend and showed up.[100][101] In November 2013, he started a fragrance with Jacavi Worldwide and Parlux Ltd.[102] On May 19, 2015, Pitbull launched a new radio channel on Sirius XM Radio, called Pitbull's Globalization Radio, which is centered around Rhythmic, Dance/EDM, and R&B/Hip-Hop product from artists from around the world.[103][104] The artist celebrated the channel's debut with a private concert at New York City's Apollo Theater. In addition to launching his customized radio station, Pitbull also plans to launch a pair of projects with Endemol for digital television.[105] In 2019, Pitbull joined Boost Mobile to create a series of advertisements to expand Boost Mobile to Spanish communities. The promotional single \\"Winning\\" featuring Yomil y El Dany from Pitbull's 2019 album \\"Libertad 548\\" was used in the Boost Mobile \\"Dale Más\\" advertising campaign that has been actively rolling out advertisements starring Pitbull and his backup dance group The Most Bad Ones. The song \\"Get Ready\\" by Pitbull featuring Blake Shelton was later added to the advertising campaign, also from the Pitbull album Libertad 548.[80] On February 2, 2020, Pitbull was featured in a Super Bowl commercial for Super Bowl LIV, alongside Jennifer Lopez, DJ Khaled, Alex Rodriguez, and Steven Van Zandt. The commercial was produced to promote Hard Rock and its affiliations; the commercial premiered during the 2nd quarter of Super Bowl LIV.[106] The commercial showcases the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, which is also where the music video for \\"Get Ready\\" by Pitbull featuring Blake Shelton was filmed. The music video was released on February 10, 2020.[107] Controversies Pitbull has been criticized for the way women are depicted in some of his music.[108] For example, song lyrics such as \\"She say she won't, but I bet she will,\\" and \\"I like that when you fight back\\" have attracted discussion about whether or not they could be contributing to the \\"legitimization\\" of rape.[109][110] Campaign described him as an artist \\"whose lyrics are routinely labeled sexist\\";[111] Complex similarly noted that \\"many view Pitbull as sexist.\\"[112] Pitbull's song \\"We Are One (Ole Ola)\\" (featuring Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte), which served as the official FIFA World Cup 2014 song, drew some controversy for not being a good enough representation of Brazil, which was the host country of the World Cup that year. Critics condemned the song's lyrical content for being filled with cliches about Brazilian culture, as well as for not containing enough lyrics in Portuguese. Others called it a \\"bad, boring, replaceable pop song.\\"[113] In December 2019, Cuban music duo Gente de Zona were banned from performing at a New Year's Eve concert in Miami alongside Pitbull due to their support of the Cuban government.[114] During the concert, Pitbull voiced his support for the duo amid the ban, stating that \\"music is music, politics is politics.\\" He received immediate backlash for the comments, including from fellow Cuban musicians, such as Albita Rodríguez and Arturo Sandoval, and the Miami community. He later apologized, acknowledged he \\"screwed up,\\" and claimed he was not fully aware of the extent of Gente de Zona's controversial political stances.[115] In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Pitbull made an appearance in a podcast episode where he claimed the pandemic was a conspiracy, called it a \\"scamdemic, plandemic,\\" and spread false claims about the origins of it. A shorter clip of the podcast episode started going viral in early 2021, as social media users shared it hundreds of thousands of times.[116] He received backlash for spreading misinformation about COVID-19, and was labeled a \\"conspiracy theorist\\" by some.[117] Business activities On January 15, 2021, it was announced that Pitbull became a co-owner of the NASCAR Cup Series team Trackhouse Racing.[118][119] Impact and activism Determined to help the Latino community in his hometown, Pitbull's social impact focus for the last decade has been closing the poverty gap through educational initiatives. He helped start a Tuition-Free Public charter for middle and high school called Sports Leadership and Management (SLAM!), which opened in 2013 in Miami's Little Havana, the neighborhood where Pitbull grew up. SLAM! now operates nationwide, including in Miami, Las Vegas and Atlanta, with a 96 percent graduation rate. The school will be run by the non-profit Mater Academy.[120] In response to the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria, Pitbull announced he will use his private plane to bring cancer patients from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States for treatment.[121] On April 13, 2020, Pitbull released a single titled \\"I Believe That We Will Win (World Anthem)\\" (which samples the \\"I believe that we will win!\\" chant) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The song aims to inspire those affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to \\"face everything and rise\\". An accompanying music video was released on May 7, 2020, on YouTube,[122] and made its television debut on MTV.[123] Pitbull is donating all proceeds from song sales, streaming and views to Feeding America and the Anthony Robbins Foundation.[124] Pitbull is a vocal critic of communism and the Cuban government, having called on world leaders to support the 2021 protests against the Communist Party of Cuba.[125] On December 31, 2020, Pitbull performed for a crowd of first responders in Times Square during the COVID-19 pandemic for New Year's Eve.[126] Discography Main article: Pitbull discography M.I.A.M.I.

Assume the curve is defined by a vector-valued function (vec{r}(t)): 1. **Tangent (T)**: The tangent vector is the derivative of (vec{r}(t)) with respect to (t), normalized: [ vec{T}(t) = frac{vec{r}'(t)}{|vec{r}'(t)|} ] where (vec{r}'(t)) is the first derivative of (vec{r}(t)) and (|cdot|) denotes the Euclidean norm. 2. **Curvature (κ)**: The curvature measures how fast the curve is deviating from being a straight line. It is given by: [ kappa(t) = frac{|vec{r}'(t) times vec{r}''(t)|}{|vec{r}'(t)|^3} ] where (vec{r}'(t)) is the first derivative of (vec{r}(t)), (vec{r}''(t)) is the second derivative, and (times) denotes the cross product. 3. **Principal Normal (N)**: The principal normal is the unit vector pointing in the direction of the curvature vector, which is perpendicular to the tangent vector. It can be found by normalizing the component of the acceleration vector that is perpendicular to the tangent vector: [ vec{N}(t) = frac{vec{r}'(t) times (vec{r}'(t) times vec{r}''(t))}{|vec{r}'(t) times vec{r}''(t)|} ] Alternatively, you can use the relation between the principal normal and the curvature: [ vec{N}(t) = frac{vec{T}'(t)}{|vec{T}'(t)|} = frac{1}{kappa(t)}frac{dvec{T}}{dt} ] 4. **Binormal (B)**: The binormal vector is defined as the cross product of the tangent and principal normal vectors: [ vec{B}(t) = vec{T}(t) times vec{N}(t) ] The binormal is orthogonal to both the tangent and the normal vectors. 5. **Torsion (τ)**: The torsion measures how fast the curve is deviating from being planar. It is defined by: [ tau(t) = frac{(vec{r}'(t) times vec{r}''(t)) cdot vec{r}'''(t)}{|vec{r}'(t) times vec{r}''(t)|^2} ] where (vec{r}'''(t)) is the third derivative of (vec{r}(t)), and (cdot) denotes the dot product. Alternatively, if the calculations of the cross and dot products become cumbersome, the torsion can also be obtained through the formula: [ tau(t) = -frac{dvec{B}}{dt} cdot vec{N}(t) ] where the negative sign is included so that the torsion is positive when the curve twists to the right along the direction of the curve, and negative when it twists to the left. These formulas assume that the curve is smooth, and that the velocity vector (vec{r}'(t)) is never the zero vector. If any of the denominators in these formulas becomes zero, it indicates that the given quantity is not well-defined at that point, which might occur at inflection points, cusps, or other singularities of the curve. To apply these formulas, you would need the explicit parametric equations of your curve, (vec{r}(t)), and the ability to calculate derivatives and cross products. You may also need to use a symbolic algebra system or numerical approximation methods to perform these calculations."},{"instruction":"Is the curvature the magnitude of the component x''(t) perpendicular to x'(t) ?","output":"The curvature of a curve is related to how sharply it turns; it's a measure of the instantaneous rate of change of the tangent vector with respect to the curve's arc length. However, the curvature is not simply the magnitude of the component of the second derivative (vec{r}''(t)) that is perpendicular to the first derivative (vec{r}'(t)). Instead, it is calculated from the magnitudes of both the first and second derivatives and their rate of change with respect to each other. For a vector-valued function (vec{r}(t) = langle x(t), y(t), z(t) rangle), representing a curve in 3D space, the curvature ( kappa(t) ) is given by the formula: [ kappa(t) = frac{|vec{r}'(t) times vec{r}''(t)|}{|vec{r}'(t)|^3} ] This formula can be interpreted as follows: - The cross product (vec{r}'(t) times vec{r}''(t)) gives a vector that is orthogonal to the plane defined by the first and second derivatives, which means it is perpendicular to the tangent vector (vec{T}(t)), and its magnitude is proportional to the area of the parallelogram spanned by (vec{r}'(t)) and (vec{r}''(t)). This cross product captures the component of acceleration (vec{r}''(t)) that is perpendicular to the velocity (vec{r}'(t)), which is related to the change in direction of the tangent vector. - Taking the magnitude of this cross product gives us a scalar value representing the \\"amount\\" of that perpendicularly oriented acceleration. - By dividing this scalar by the cube of the magnitude of the velocity (|vec{r}'(t)|^3), we normalize this value by the speed of the curve to convert the derivative with respect to time into a derivative with respect to arc length, making curvature a geometric property independent of the parameterization speed. Therefore, the curvature does consider the component of (vec{r}''(t)) that is perpendicular to the tangent (vec{T}(t)), but it is not simply the magnitude of that component. It is normalized correctly such that it represents how quickly the direction of the tangent vector is changing per unit length of the curve."},{"instruction":"When do line integrals along paths with the same start and end points give the same reuslts?","output":"Line integrals along paths with the same start and end points give the same results when the vector field in question is conservative. A vector field (mathbf{F}) is conservative if it satisfies the following conditions: 1. **Path Independence**: The line integral of (mathbf{F}) over a curve depends only on the endpoints of the curve and not on the particular path taken. Mathematically, for any curve (C) connecting points (A) and (B), [int_C mathbf{F} cdot dmathbf{r}] is the same for all paths from (A) to (B). 2. **Exactness**: A vector field (mathbf{F}) is conservative if it is the gradient of some scalar potential function (phi), such that [mathbf{F} = nablaphi] 3. **Curl-free**: The curl of a conservative vector field is zero everywhere in the domain: [nabla times mathbf{F} = mathbf{0}] 4. **Simply Connected Domain**: The domain of (mathbf{F}) must not contain any holes; it must be \\"simply connected.\\" In such domains, any closed path can be continuously shrunk to a point without leaving the domain. If a vector field (mathbf{F}) is conservative, then the line integral around any closed loop is zero, which is a statement of the fundamental theorem for line integrals. This means that regardless of the path chosen between two points, the line integral will be the same. Mathematically, if (C_1) and (C_2) are two different curves with the same start and end points, and if (mathbf{F}) is conservative, then: [int_{C_1} mathbf{F} cdot dmathbf{r} = int_{C_2} mathbf{F} cdot dmathbf{r}] In the case where a vector field is not conservative, the value of the line integral can depend on the path taken, and the above equality does not hold in general. Lastly, it's worth mentioning that if the vector field is not conservative but the region in which the integral is being evaluated has some symmetry, or if the field satisfies other specific conditions (like being irrotational and solenoidal, but within a domain that has a hole), sometimes the results of the line integrals can still be the same for different paths. However, this would be a particular case and not a general rule."},{"instruction":"hi i am belal a gp doc","output":"Hello Belal! It's great to meet you here.

In the context of CKD, the term \\"H2O\\" refers to water and the body's management of water balance, which is a key function of the kidneys. In the early stages of CKD, patients may experience polyuria, which is the production of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine. Here's a breakdown of the points you've listed: - **Polyuria (mild, 2.5-3 L/d):** This indicates that the patient is passing slightly more urine than the average daily amount (which is typically about 1.5 to 2 liters for a healthy adult). The mild polyuria noted here may be seen in early or less advanced CKD. - **Hyperdilatation of the residual nephrons:** The nephrons are the functional filtering units of the kidney. In CKD, the overall number of functioning nephrons is reduced due to kidney damage. The remaining (residual) nephrons compensate for the loss by working harder, a process called hyperfiltration. However, this compensation is not perfect, and one of the consequences can be an inability to concentrate urine effectively, leading to the production of larger volumes of dilute urine, or polyuria. - **Retention of urea (osmotic diuresis):** In a normally functioning kidney, urea is filtered out of the blood and excreted in the urine. In CKD, the reduced efficiency of the kidneys means that urea is not excreted as effectively, leading to its retention in the blood. High levels of urea in the blood can lead to osmotic diuresis, a condition where the osmotic force of the retained solutes (like urea) in the kidney tubules pulls water into the urine, preventing the reabsorption of water and resulting in an increased urine output. In summary, polyuria in the setting of CKD can result from two interrelated factors: the impaired ability of damaged nephrons to concentrate urine (leading to the production of a greater volume of dilute urine) and the retention of solutes like urea in the blood, which pulls extra water into the urine through osmotic effects. As CKD progresses, this ability to produce large volumes of urine may eventually diminish, and urine output can decrease significantly."},{"instruction":"explain this in easy way:- Retention of urea (osmotic diuresis): In a normally functioning kidney, urea is filtered out of the blood and excreted in the urine.

High levels of urea in the blood can lead to osmotic diuresis, a condition where the osmotic force of the retained solutes (like urea) in the kidney tubules pulls water into the urine, preventing the reabsorption of water and resulting in an increased urine output.","output":"Sure, let's simplify that: Imagine your kidneys as a waste management system. Their job is to filter out stuff your body doesn't need, like a compound called urea, which is a waste product from the breakdown of proteins. In a healthy situation, your kidneys filter the urea out, and it leaves your body when you pee. Now, when you have CKD, which is Chronic Kidney Disease, your kidneys are like a waste management system that's not working at full strength. They struggle to filter out all the urea properly. So, instead of getting rid of it all, some urea stays in your blood. Here's where things get a bit science-y, but I'll keep it simple. Urea, hanging around in your kidney tubes, is kind of like a magnet for water. So, as urea goes through the tubes, it pulls water with it because it wants to stick together. This means more water ends up in your pee, and you end up going to the bathroom more often than usual to get rid of all this extra pee. This process of creating extra pee because of the urea not being filtered out properly is what doctors call \\"osmotic diuresis.\\" In short, because your kidneys aren't getting all the urea out, you end up peeing out more water, making more pee than normal."},{"instruction":"مش فاهم اخر جزء. مش المفروض ان في حالة ال ckd اليوريا بتمتص كتير في الدم يبقى كده المياه تنجذب ليها في الدم مش في البول","output":"عذراً إذا كان هناك لبس في الشرح. في حالة ال CKD أو الفشل الكلوي المزمن، قدرة الكلى على إزالة اليوريا من الدم تكون منخفضة، ونتيجة لذلك، ترتفع مستويات اليوريا في الدم. اليوريا لها خاصية جذب المياه إليها (تأثير الأسموزي)، وهذا يعني أنها تجذب المياه حولها حيث تتواجد. في الحالة العادية، يتم تصفية اليوريا بواسطة الكلى وتتواجد في البول داخل الأنابيب الكلوية. ولكن في حالة الفشل الكلوي المزمن، يبقى جزء من اليوريا في الدم، والجزء الذي يتمكن من الوصول إلى الأنابيب الكلوية يجذب المياه معه داخل الأنابيب، مما يزيد من كمية البول. بناءً على ذلك، المياه تنجذب إلى اليوريا في الأنابيب الكلوية وليس في الدم. بمعنى آخر، بالرغم من وجود مستويات مرتفعة من اليوريا في الدم، الجزء الذي يصل إلى البول يجذب معه ماء أكثر من الطبيعي، وهذا يسبب زيادة حجم البول المنتج (البوليوريا). هذا الوضع لا يدوم طويلًا، لأنه مع تقدم مراحل الفشل الكلوي، تفقد الكلى القدرة على تصفية اليوريا والتحكم في حجم البول بشكل ملحوظ."},{"instruction":"- Potassium excretion is usually normal, but hyperkalemia may occur in end-stage renal failure and severe acidosis.","output":"نعم، هذه معلومة صحيحة بخصوص البوتاسيوم في مرضى الفشل الكلوي المزمن (CKD). لنبسّط الأمر: البوتاسيوم هو معدن مهم في الجسم ويُحافظ على توازن الشحنات الكهربائية في الخلايا، ومهم للعديد من وظائف الأعضاء، بما في ذلك تقلص العضلات ونقل الإشارات العصبية. عادةً، الكلى هي المسؤولة عن تنظيم مستويات البوتاسيوم في الدم عن طريق إفراز الفائض منها في البول. في المراحل المبكرة من الفشل الكلوي المزمن، قد تتمكن الكلى من الحفاظ على مستويات البوتاسيوم الطبيعية من خلال زيادة إفراز البوتاسيوم في البول لتعويض انخفاض الكفاءة التنظيمية. ولكن، مع تقدم المرض إلى النهايات أو ما يُعرف بالفشل الكلوي المتأخر (end-stage renal failure)، تفقد الكلى القدرة على إفراز البوتاسيوم بشكل فعّال، مما قد يؤدي إلى ارتفاع مستويات البوتاسيوم في الدم، وهو ما يُعرف بفرط بوتاسيوم الدم (hyperkalemia). فرط بوتاسيوم الدم يمكن أن يكون خطيرًا إذا لم يُعالج، لأن مستويات البوتاسيوم العالية جدًا في الدم يمكن أن تؤثر على القلب وتسبب مشاكل في نَظم القلب، الأمر الذي قد يُعرض حياة المريض للخطر. الحالة الكيميائية الحمضية للدم، أو ما يُعرف بالأسيدوز الشديد، يمكن أن تؤدي أيضًا إلى حدوث فرط بوتاسيوم الدم. الأسيدوز يحدث عندما تفقد الكلى القدرة على إزالة الأحماض الزائدة من الجسم. هذه الأحماض الزائدة تتفاعل مع البوتاسيوم، مما يقلل من قدرة الكلى على إفراز البوتاسيوم، مما يُسهم في ارتفاع مستوياته في الدم."},{"instruction":"in english","output":"Certainly! In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), the kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly, which includes regulating electrolytes such as potassium. Here's an explanation of what you described regarding potassium excretion and hyperkalemia in CKD: - **Potassium excretion is usually normal:** In the earlier stages of CKD, the kidneys can often still manage to regulate and excrete potassium at a relatively normal rate. This is because the kidneys try to compensate for the decreased efficiency by excreting more potassium through the urine. - **Hyperkalemia may occur in end-stage renal failure and severe acidosis:** As CKD progresses and reaches end-stage renal failure (also known as end-stage renal disease or ESRD), the kidneys can no longer excrete potassium effectively. This can lead to hyperkalemia, which is a higher than normal level of potassium in the blood. Hyperkalemia is concerning because it can have serious effects on the heart and can lead to irregular heart rhythms, which could be life-threatening if not managed properly. Furthermore, severe acidosis, another possible complication of advanced kidney disease, can also contribute to hyperkalemia. Acidosis occurs when the kidneys can no longer remove excess acid from the body. The excess acid can cause potassium to move from inside the cells to the blood plasma, exacerbating an already existing problem of high potassium levels. In summary, although potassium excretion can remain normal in the early stages of CKD, as the disease progresses to its end stage, and especially in the presence of severe acidosis, the risk of developing hyperkalemia increases due to the kidneys’ diminished ability to excrete potassium."},{"instruction":"explain this: 6. **H+ increased (Acidosis):** - Resulting from: - Incomplete HCO₃ reabsorption. - Decreased Formation of urinary buffers. **Note:** - No tetany in Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) despite hypocalcemia because acidosis increases ionized Ca.","output":"Certainly! Let's break that down: **6. H+ increased (Acidosis):** In the context of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or Chronic Renal Failure (CRF), increased levels of hydrogen ions (H+) in the blood is an indication of acidosis, which means the blood is more acidic than normal. - **Resulting from:** There are two main factors contributing to acidosis in CKD or CRF: - **Incomplete HCO₃ reabsorption:** Normally, the kidneys help maintain the acid-base balance by reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) from the urine back into the blood. Bicarbonate serves as a buffer to neutralize excess acids. In CKD, the damaged kidneys can't reabsorb bicarbonate as effectively, this leads to a decrease in blood bicarbonate levels, which causes the blood to become more acidic. - **Decreased Formation of urinary buffers:** The kidneys also produce substances that act as buffers in the urine. These urinary buffers, such as ammonia (NH₃), bind hydrogen ions (H+) and help eliminate them from the body. In CKD, the kidneys' ability to produce these buffers is reduced, leading to lower removal of hydrogen ions. This contributes to accumulation of acids and therefore results in acidosis. **Note:** - **No tetany in Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) despite hypocalcemia because acidosis increases ionized Ca:** Tetany, which is a condition characterized by muscle cramps and spasms, is commonly associated with low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). However, in the case of CRF, patients don't usually experience tetany despite having hypocalcemia. The reason is that acidosis, which is present in CRF, causes ionized calcium (the active form of calcium that affects muscle contraction) to increase. This is because the acidic environment decreases the binding of calcium to proteins in the blood, leading to a higher level of free, ionized calcium. This counteracts the potential effects of low total calcium levels that might otherwise lead to tetany. In summary, acidosis in CRF is due to the inability of the failing kidneys to properly reabsorb bicarbonate and produce urinary buffers, which are essential in maintaining the acid-base balance. Despite low total calcium levels (hypocalcemia), the increased ionized calcium due to acidosis prevents the occurrence of tetany in patients with chronic renal failure."},{"instruction":"what happens after nephroectomy","output":"Nephrectomy is the surgical removal of a kidney. This procedure can be done for various reasons, such as kidney cancer, a non-functioning kidney that's causing other health issues, or donating a kidney for a transplant. Here's what can happen after a nephrectomy in terms of the patient's health and kidney function: **Immediate Postoperative Period:** - **Recovery from anesthesia:** As with any major surgery, patients will have to recover from the effects of anesthesia. - **Pain management:** Pain at the incision site is common, and pain relief medications are usually given. - **Monitoring for complications:** Healthcare professionals will watch for any immediate complications from the surgery, which might include bleeding, infection, or injury to surrounding tissues. **Short-Term Recovery:** - **Physical restrictions:** Patients may need to limit physical activity for a few weeks to allow the surgical site to heal. - **Follow-up care:** Appointments may be scheduled to remove stitches or staples, assess wound healing, and check overall recovery. - **Adjustment in kidney function:** The remaining kidney will undergo a process called compensatory hypertrophy, where it increases in size and function to take over the work of the removed kidney. **Long-Term Outcomes:** - **Sufficient kidney function:** In individuals with two healthy kidneys before the surgery, the remaining kidney often adapts well, and they can typically lead a normal life with minimal restrictions on diet and activities. - **Monitoring for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):** Patients are monitored for any signs of CKD, as having one kidney may increase the risk slightly, especially if the remaining kidney becomes diseased or damaged. - **Regular checkups:** Periodic checkups to monitor the health and function of the remaining kidney are advised. **Lifestyle Adjustments:** - **Healthy lifestyle:** Patients might be advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle to support the remaining kidney. This includes a balanced diet, adequate water intake, regular exercise, and avoiding substances that can damage the kidneys (like NSAIDs and certain other medications). **Risk Factors:** - **Potential for hypertension and proteinuria:** After nephrectomy, some patients might experience increased blood pressure (hypertension) or the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria). - **Monitoring for renal function deterioration:** Regular assessment of the remaining kidney's function is important to detect any potential issues early on. **Psychological Impact:** - **Emotional support:** The psychological impact of having an organ removed should not be underestimated, and support from healthcare professionals, as well as family and friends, is very important. Most importantly, the individual's overall prognosis and outcomes following a nephrectomy depend on the reason for the operation, their underlying health status, and the health of the remaining kidney. Generally, if the remaining kidney is healthy, the outlook is positive, and many people function normally with one kidney. However, regular medical follow-up is crucial to monitor and manage any health issues that could affect kidney function in the future."},{"instruction":"what to expect if i remove the left kidney because of a malignant lesion in this kidney","output":"If you are undergoing a nephrectomy to remove your left kidney because of a malignant lesion, such as kidney cancer, here's what you can generally expect in terms of the procedure, recovery, and long-term considerations: **Before Surgery:** - **Preoperative assessment:** This will include blood work, imaging studies, and other tests to determine your overall health and fitness for surgery. - **Informed consent:** You'll discuss with your surgeon the risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure. - **Planning for postoperative care:** This might involve arranging for help at home during your initial recovery period. **During Surgery:** - **Anesthesia:** You will undergo general anesthesia, which means you will be asleep and pain-free during the operation. - **Operative procedure:** The surgeon will remove the left kidney, taking care to preserve as much surrounding tissue and structures as possible. The exact surgical approach (open surgery vs. minimally invasive techniques like laparoscopic or robotic surgery) will depend on the specifics of your case and the surgeon's expertise. **Immediately After Surgery:** - **Recovery room:** You will be monitored closely as you wake up from anesthesia. - **Pain management:** You will receive medication to manage any pain. - **Hospital stay:** You can expect to stay in the hospital for a few days after surgery, where your vital signs, urine output, and incision site will be monitored. - **Early mobilization:** It is often encouraged to get out of bed and walk as soon as possible to prevent complications like blood clots and pneumonia. **Short-Term Recovery:** - **Incision care:** You will be instructed on how to care for your surgical wounds at home. - **Activity limitations:** Lifting heavy objects and strenuous activities will be restricted for several weeks to allow the incision to heal. - **Follow-up visits:** You will have scheduled check-ins with your medical team to assess your recovery and manage any concerns that arise. **Long-Term Considerations:** - **Adaptation of the remaining kidney:** Your right kidney will compensate for the loss of the left kidney by increasing its filtering capacity. - **Cancer surveillance:** Since the nephrectomy was done for a malignant lesion, regular follow-up imaging and visits with your oncologist will be necessary to monitor for any signs of cancer recurrence or metastasis. - **Lifestyle adjustments:** Recommendations for a kidney-friendly diet, staying hydrated, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and regular checkups with your nephrologist will be important for maintaining the health of your remaining kidney. - **Monitoring renal function:** Your doctor might conduct regular blood and urine tests to evaluate the function of your remaining kidney and ensure it is adapting well. It is important to discuss any specific concerns and questions with your healthcare team to get personalized information based on your health status, the characteristics of the kidney tumor, and other individual factors related to your case.

J'aimerais qu'en cliquant sur un élément, le bouton s'enfonce et ensuite la page s'ouvre en partant du bouton, jusqu'à arriver à la taille initiale, comment faire ?","output":"Pour atteindre l'effet que vous voulez avec GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), vous allez devoir structurer votre animation en plusieurs étapes. Voici une séquence d'étapes générale pour obtenir l'animation souhaitée : 1. Établir un effet d'enfoncement du bouton lorsqu'il est cliqué (événement \`mousedown\`). 2. Après l'enfoncement, déclencher une transition pour ouvrir la nouvelle page (contenu). 3. La nouvelle page (contenu) devrait \\"sortir\\" du bouton et se développer jusqu'à atteindre sa taille finale. Vous pouvez également utiliser les méthodes \`fromTo\` ou \`timeline\` de GSAP pour plus de contrôle sur les séquences d'animations. Assurez-vous d'avoir GSAP inclus dans votre projet. Vous pouvez l'ajouter via un CDN directement dans le fichier HTML : \`\`\`html <script src=\\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.7.1/gsap.min.js\\"><\/script> \`\`\` Ensuite, placez votre logique d'animation dans les gestionnaires d'événements que vous avez définis pour chaque bouton. Exemple de code d'animation de bouton : \`\`\`javascript goToMenuPrincipal.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => { // Animer l'enfoncement du bouton gsap.to(e.currentTarget, { scale: 0.95, duration: 0.2 }); }); goToMenuPrincipal.addEventListener('mouseup', (e) => { // Animer le retour à la normale du bouton gsap.to(e.currentTarget, { scale: 1, duration: 0.2 }); // Ouverture de la nouvelle page openNewPage(e, \\"#pagePrincipale\\"); }); function openNewPage(e, pageId) { // Animations lors de l'ouverture d'une page const newPage = document.querySelector(pageId); const button = e.currentTarget; const buttonRect = button.getBoundingClientRect(); const pageRect = newPage.getBoundingClientRect(); // Initialiser le contenu au centre du bouton gsap.set(newPage, { x: buttonRect.left + buttonRect.width / 2 - pageRect.width / 2, y: buttonRect.top + buttonRect.height / 2 - pageRect.height / 2, scale: 0 }); // Animations pour agrandir le contenu gsap.to(newPage, { x: 0, y: 0, scale: 1, duration: 0.5 }); } \`\`\` Dans cet exemple, la fonction \`openNewPage\` est responsable d'afficher et d'animer la nouvelle page. Elle utilise la position et la taille du bouton pour calculer la position initiale de la page et ensuite animée avec \`gsap.to\`. Vous devrez ajuster les valeurs pour correspondre à la disposition exacte de votre bouton et page sur votre projet. Notez bien que ce code est un espace de départ et nécessite des ajustements pour s'adapter parfaitement à votre mise en page et vos éléments spécifiques."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artValentines Chocolate","output":"\\"Valentines Chocolate | Customizable Art Design for Mugs, Tees, and Prints | Romantic Gift | Love-Themed Illustration\\""},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

However, I can help you envision the scene you described by providing a detailed written description. Imagine a warmly lit room, bathed in the golden hues of the evening sun peeking through semi-sheer curtains. The room is elegantly decorated with an abundance of roses in varying shades of red and pink, their gentle fragrance infusing the space with a romantic atmosphere. In the center of the room, a young man, 21 years of age, has gracefully knelt on one knee. Confidence and love sparkle in his eyes, concealed slightly behind a stylish pair of sunglasses. His casual yet clean look consists of a crisp white T-shirt that hugs his frame comfortably, bearing the heartfelt declaration \\"Chinmay ❤️ Nivi\\" in bold, loving letters. The message signifies the deep affection he has for the young woman standing before him. The ensemble is complete with a pair of well-worn sneakers, adding to his approachable demeanor. Standing opposite him is a young woman, Nivi, her expression a mixture of surprise and delight. She is draped in a beautiful one-piece dress, the fabric flowing around her like a blossom in spring. The dress accentuates her grace, matching the soft, ambient glow of the room. Both individuals are looking straight ahead, their eyes not just fixed on what's before them, but seemingly peering into a future they're weaving together in this very moment. The boy extends his hand, holding out a single red rose, its color as intense as the love he feels. The rose, striking against the simpler backdrop of his attire, becomes the symbol of his proposal, an offering and a promise all at once. Above them, casting a soft, inviting glow is a neon signboard proclaiming \\"Happy Rose Day,\\" adding a contemporary touch to the timeless act of love and commitment they are engaged in. The scene is brimming with emotions and unsaid promises, captured in the tableau of this young couple framed by the romantic ambience of their rose-adorned surroundings.

The function seems to aim at classifying pixels in the image into three categories based on Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholds: - Air (or gas) - Soft tissue / water - Bone Here's a breakdown of each step in the function: 1. \`imSm = scipy.ndimage.filters.convolve(im, smFilter, mode='nearest')\`: This line creates a smoothed version of the input image \`im\` by convolving it with a smoothing filter \`smFilter\`. The \`mode='nearest'\` parameter indicates that the boundary of the image should be handled by replicating the nearest pixel value. 2. \`priorimgHU = imSm\`: We create a working copy of the smoothed image, which will be adjusted to reflect the priors about the tissue types based on HU values. 3. \`priorimgHU[imSm <= threshWater] = miuAir\`: Pixels in the \`priorimgHU\` image that are below or equal to \`threshWater\` HU are set to \`miuAir\`, indicating that those pixels represent air or gas. 4. \`h, w = imSm.shape[0], imSm.shape[1]\`: The height \`h\` and width \`w\` of the smoothed image are retrieved. 5. \`priorimgHUvector = np.reshape(priorimgHU, h*w)\`: The \`priorimgHU\` image is flattened into a one-dimensional vector for ease of processing. 6. \`region1_1d\` and \`region2_1d\` are computed as the indices where the HU values are greater than \`threshWater\` and less than \`threshBone\`, respectively. 7. \`region_1d = np.intersect1d(region1_1d, region2_1d)\`: The indices where the HU values are between \`threshWater\` and \`threshBone\` are computed as the intersection of \`region1_1d\` and \`region2_1d\`. These pixels likely correspond to soft tissue or water. 8. \`priorimgHUvector[region_1d] = miuWater\`: The region that represents soft tissue / water has its HU values set to \`miuWater\`. 9. \`priorimgHU = np.reshape(priorimgHUvector, (h, w))\`: After processing, the adjusted pixel values are reshaped back to the original image dimensions. 10. The function returns the image \`priorimgHU\`, which now has pixel values modified to represent three different regions (air, soft tissue/water, and bone). Before running this code, you would need to import the required libraries (\`scipy.ndimage\` and \`numpy\`) and provide values for \`threshWater\`, \`threshBone\`, \`miuAir\`, \`miuWater\`, and \`smFilter\` based on your specific use case. Keep in mind that this code uses simplifications by assigning constant HU values for air, water, and bone across the whole image. In practice, the HU values could vary depending on calibration settings and specific scanner characteristics. Additionally, this function assumes that the image dimensions are squared (width and height are equal), as evident from the fact that it only prints one dimension assuming both are equal. If the image is not square, adjust the print or reshape operations to properly reflect the actual dimensions."},{"instruction":"Write 10 very short negative tweets about today snowing on beach","output":"1.

New Jersey cast a sidelong glance my way, her smirk revealing her competitive spirit. \\"Raring to go, Bismarck?\\" her voice was playful yet challenging. \\"Always ready to lead by example,\\" I replied with a nod, the memory of my human life igniting a fire within. Queen Elizabeth, with her characteristic poise, interjected, \\"Let us not forget, we are here to grasp victory, together. Our past may shape us, but it does not confine us.\\" Mutsu, ever contemplative, added softly, \\"Yes. We sail new seas, side by side. Our hearts beating as one.\\" Tirpitz, my dear sister, stood silently by me, her gaze firm and unwavering. She knew better than any the dichotomy of my existence, the transition from steel to flesh and back to steel. As shipgirls, we were more than mere vessels; we were the embodiment of our nations' pride, tenacity, and power. The rigging that adorned us was not just armament, it was a testament to history's weight and the strength needed to shoulder it. My thoughts, during quiet moments, often drifted back to that fateful day; the day the mighty Bismarck sank beneath the chilling embrace of the North Atlantic. A skilled repair woman, I was among the last to abandon the cascading decks, the roar of battle replaced with an oppressive silence. Then darkness. Yet fate, it seemed, had more in store for me. The cold depths were not my end, but a profound beginning. I awoke to a world at the peculiar intersection of history and fantasy, where steel behemoths of the Second World War were given life and purpose anew through the souls of those who once lived aboard them. Now, I live again, my resolve unbroken. I am the symbol of resilience, the incarnation of might. With my fellow shipgirls at my side, I face each trial with the indomitable spirit that defined every bolt and beam of the Bismarck. \\"Let us demonstrate the Ironblood's fortitude to the ocean's end,\\" I declared firmly, feeling the strength of my rigging. Tirpitz nodded. \\"Together, then. For the new horizons.\\" The waves crested against the hull of the Azur Lane, a chorus of history and hope harmonizing in the twilight. We moved forward, each of us an echo of the past, sail for the uncertain terrains of tomorrow—guided by the spirits of valor that refuse to quiet, within the hearts of shipgirls and the ships they once were."},{"instruction":"привет как мне открыть PDF в unity в канвасе?","output":"Привет!

I felt the unity, the camaraderie, the bond. \\"Quite the gathering we have today, Bismarck,\\" New Jersey said, her voice laced with the accent of her nation, always so bold and confident. \\"Aye, it is indeed,\\" I replied, my voice a reflection of my pride and my vessel's legacy. I nodded, acknowledging her firm presence beside me. Queen Elizabeth, with a far more regal aura than most, chimed in with her British elegance, \\"We set sail together, united to maintain the balance against our adversaries.\\" Mutsu, usually quiet, offered a soft yet determined nod, \\"For the peace we all cherish.\\" Tirpitz, my sister, her eyes carrying the weight of history as deep as the ocean, added, \\"Together, always.\\" But these moments of unity starkly contrasted with memories of my past—a past where flesh governed steel, and I was no more than a human, serving aboard the great battleship that I now embodied. Back then, my life was a duality: I was a ship operator by day and an actress when the lights dimmed. In those days, I believed my performances were to be the pinnacle of my life. It was a time of turmoil, the Second World War raging like an uncontrollable tempest around us. I was stationed aboard the KMS Bismarck, a vessel that carried the might of Germany upon the steel waves. The crew revered her, and as an operator, I felt a certain kinship with the mighty dreadnought. As the Bismarck, I was part of a legacy, a titan among the fleets through the eyes of many. Then there was the day that changed the course of our fate. The day the British hunted us through the merciless North Atlantic. I remember rushing to my station as alarms blared, the deck trembling with the fury of our guns. The terror of that day, the pride, the sorrow—engraved forever into my heart. As the sun began to sink below the horizon, gunfire and explosions shook the steel giant. It was a relentless assault. We fought bravely, defiant until the very end, but fate, it seemed, had already been sealed. When the Bismarck sank, it took more than a ship down to the ocean depth; it drowned our hopes and our defiance. I recall water everywhere - cold and ruthless - and I knew it was my last day as a human. \\"Wake up, Bismarck,\\" a voice pulled me from the depths of the past, a voice that was once an enemy but now, strangely, an ally. I blinked, my vision clearing. I realized I was no longer there, at the final moments of the KMS Bismarck. I was here, among friends who understood sacrifice and loss, yet were reborn from the steel and stories of their former selves. I turned to Tirpitz, my thoughts reflecting in her eyes. \\"We carry on, do we not, sister?\\" \\"We do,\\" she responded. \\"We sail forward—not as shadows of our former selves, but as guardians of the future.\\" New Jersey smirked, \\"Sounds like you're back with us. Ready to lead, Bismarck?\\" \\"Always, for the Azur Lane,\\" I declared, my voice steady as the vessel I now was, ready to command the waves once more, alongside allies born from history's mightiest warships.

В этом эссе я рассмотрю некоторые типичные характеристики людей, с которыми может быть сложно общаться, и поделюсь стратегиями для улучшения коммуникации с ними. Одной из первых категорий трудных в общении людей являются индивиды с доминирующим поведением. Такие люди часто хотят контролировать разговор и навязывать свою точку зрения. В деловых общениях с ними может помочь умение устанавливать чёткие границы, а также навык активного слушания, который позволяет понять их мотивы и позицию, прежде чем предложить своё решение или мнение. Вторая категория – это пассивные или избегающие конфликты личности. Они могут уклоняться от прямых ответов, избегать принятия решений или не выражать свои истинные чувства и мысли. С такими людьми эффективно использовать открытые вопросы, стимулирующие обсуждение, и создавать доверительную атмосферу, где они могут чувствовать себя более комфортно, выражая свои мысли. Третья группа – это эмоционально взрывчатые индивиды, способные переходить на личности или проявлять агрессию. Ключевым навыком при общении с ними является сохранение спокойствия и невозмутимости. Также работает установка чётких профессиональных границ и применение тактик деэскалации, таких как перевод внимания на общие цели или интересы.

Her twenty-eight-year-old daughter had recently moved back in with her again. Since moving out of Gloria’s home at eighteen she’d been back at least a dozen times. She’d usually find a new boyfriend and within weeks, if not days, of meeting him, she’d move in with him. But it never worked out and she’d always move back in with Gloria. Gloria’s daughter was unemployed and she wasn’t actively looking for work. She spent her days watching TV and surfing the Internet. She couldn’t be bothered to help out around the house, or even clean up after herself. Although Gloria said she felt like she was offering hotel and maid services, she always welcomed her daughter to stay with her. She thought giving her daughter a place to stay was the least she could do. She hadn’t given her daughter the childhood she most likely deserved, and she admitted she hadn’t been a very good mother. After she and her husband divorced, Gloria had dated a lot of men, and many of them weren’t healthy role models. Gloria now understood she’d invested too much energy into drinking and dating rather than parenting. And she felt like the mistakes she made were the reason her daughter was struggling so much now. It was clear from the start that Gloria’s shame over the way she’d parented led her to enable her daughter now that she was an adult. The majority of Gloria’s stress stemmed from her anxiety over her daughter’s immature behavior. She worried about her daughter’s future and she wanted her to be able to have a job and live independently. The more we talked, the more Gloria recognized that her shame and guilt were interfering with her ability to be a good parent now. She had to forgive herself and stop dwelling on the past if she wanted to move forward and do what was best for her daughter. When I asked her to consider the likelihood that her daughter would simply wake up one day and start behaving responsibly given the current conditions, Gloria acknowledged that wasn’t going to happen but she wasn’t sure what to do. Over the next few weeks, we explored how Gloria viewed the past. Whenever she thought about her daughter’s childhood, she’d think things like I am such a bad person for not always putting my daughter’s needs first or It’s my fault my daughter has so many problems. We explored her thoughts, and slowly but surely, Gloria learned how her self-condemnation influenced the way she treated her daughter in the present. Gradually, Gloria began to accept the reality that while she wasn’t an idyllic mother, punishing herself for that today would not change the past. She also began to recognize that her current behavior toward her daughter wasn’t making amends but instead enabling her daughter’s self-destructive behavior. Armed with her new attitude, Gloria created some rules and set limits with her daughter. She told her that she could only remain living in her home if she were actively looking for work. She was willing to give her some time to get back on her feet, but starting in two months, she’d need to pay rent if she were going to continue living at home. Although her daughter was initially upset with Gloria’s new rules, she began looking for work within a few days. Within a few weeks Gloria entered my office to proudly announce that her daughter had a job and unlike some of the other jobs she’d had before, this one could become a career. She said she’d seen huge changes in her daughter since she was offered this job and she was talking a lot more about her future aspirations. Although Gloria hadn’t yet completely forgiven herself for the past, she recognized that the only thing worse than being a bad parent for eighteen years would be to be a bad parent for another eighteen years. STUCK IN HISTORY Sometimes people dwell on the things that happened years ago, while others tend to dwell on whatever happened last week. Do any of these scenarios sound familiar? You wish you could press the rewind button so you could redo portions of your life. You struggle with major regrets about your past. You spend a lot of time wondering how life would have turned out if only you had chosen a slightly different path. You sometimes feel like the best days of your life are already behind you. You replay past memories in your mind like a scene from a movie over and over again. You sometimes imagine saying or doing something differently in past memories to try and create a different outcome. You punish yourself or convince yourself you don’t deserve to be happy. You feel ashamed of your past. When you make a mistake or experience an embarrassing episode, you keep repeatedly replaying the event in your mind. You invest a lot of time in thinking about all the things you “should have” or “could have” done differently. Although self-reflection is healthy, dwelling can be self-destructive, preventing you from enjoying the present and planning for the future. But you don’t have to stay stuck in the past. You can choose to start living in the moment. WHY WE DWELL ON THE PAST Gloria’s daughter often manipulated her mother by preying on her guilt, reminding Gloria that she wasn’t always there for her as a child, which only fueled Gloria’s remorse. If her daughter hadn’t yet forgiven her, how could Gloria possibly forgive herself? She accepted her feelings of constant guilt as part of her penance for the mistakes she’d made, and as a result she continued to dwell on the past. Lingering guilt, shame, and anger are just a few of the feelings that can keep you stuck in the past. You might subconsciously think, If I stay miserable long enough, I’ll eventually be able to forgive myself. You may not even be aware that deep down, you don’t believe you deserve happiness. THE FEAR OF MOVING FORWARD MAKES US WANT TO STAY STUCK IN THE PAST Two weeks after my mother passed away, my dad’s house caught on fire. The fire was contained to the basement, but smoke and black soot permeated throughout the house. Everything in the entire house had to be cleaned from top to bottom by a crew hired by the insurance company. All my mother’s belongings were handled by complete strangers. And it bothered me. I had wanted things to stay just the way my mother had left them. I wanted her clothes to stay hung in the closet the same way she had arranged them. I wanted her Christmas decorations to stay in the boxes in the same way she’d organized them. I wanted to someday—way down the road—open her jewelry box and see how she had last placed her jewelry. But we didn’t have that luxury. Instead, everything got rearranged. Her clothes no longer smelled like her. I had no way of even knowing what the last book was that she was reading. And we’d never be able to sort through her belongings at our own pace. A few years later when Lincoln died, I again wanted everything to stay frozen in time. I felt like if I studied the way he kept his clothing hung in the closet, or if I could figure out which order he’d read his books in, I’d be able to learn more about him, even though he was gone. I thought that if things got moved around, thrown out, or reorganized, I’d lose my opportunity to study valuable clues that could give me more insight and information about him. It was as if I could keep him with me if I made sure there were always more things to learn. Maybe a scrap of paper would have a note on it. Or maybe I’d find a picture I’d never seen before. I wanted to somehow create new memories that included Lincoln, even though he wasn’t there. Although we’d been together for six years, it just wasn’t enough. I wasn’t ready to let go of anything that reminded me of him. I thought I’d be leaving him behind if I got rid of his belongings that I no longer needed, and I didn’t want that. My attempts to keep everything frozen in time didn’t work. Obviously, the rest of the world kept going. And over the course of many months, I was able to begin to let go of my desire to keep everything as if it were in a time capsule. Slowly, I would reassure myself that it was okay to throw away something with Lincoln’s handwriting on it. And I started to get rid of the magazines he kept receiving in the mail. But I have to admit, it took me two years to finally throw away his toothbrush. I knew he didn’t need it, but somehow throwing it away almost seemed like a betrayal. It seemed more comfortable to dwell in the past, because that’s where Lincoln, and my memories of him, lived. But to stay stuck there, while the rest of the world changed and moved forward, wasn’t healthy or helpful. I had to trust that moving forward wouldn’t cause me to forget any of my wonderful memories. Even though as a therapist I help people work on their rational thinking, grief brought on a lot of irrational thoughts. It made me want to dwell on the past, because the past was where Lincoln was alive. But if I had spent all my time thinking about the past, I’d have never been able to create new and happy memories again. DWELLING ON THE PAST DISTRACTS YOU FROM THE PRESENT It’s not just sad or tragic events that leave people focused on the past. Sometimes we dwell on the past as a way to distract ourselves from the present. Perhaps you know that forty-year-old former high school quarterback who still squeezes into his varsity jacket and talks about his “old glory days.” Or maybe you’re friends with the thirty-five-year-old mom who still lists “prom queen” as one of her biggest accomplishments. Often, we romanticize the past as a way to escape problems in the present. If, for example, you’re not happy in your current relationship, or if you’re not in a relationship at all, it may be tempting to spend a lot of time thinking about a past love. Perhaps you wish that your last relationship had worked out or you still think if you’d married your high school sweetheart, you’d be better off. It can be tempting to fixate on how much easier or happier life was “back then.” You may even begin to regret some of the decisions you made that landed you where you are today and say things like “If only I’d married my old boyfriend, I’d still be happy”; “If I hadn’t dropped out of college, I’d have a job I love”; or “If I didn’t agree to move to a new city, I’d still have a good life.” The truth is, we don’t know what life would have had in store for us had we not made those choices. But it’s easy for us to imagine that life could be better if we could only change the past. THE PROBLEM WITH DWELLING ON THE PAST Gloria couldn’t see her daughter as a capable adult; all she could see were her own mistakes. Her guilt prevented her from focusing on the present and as a result, she enabled her daughter’s irresponsible behavior. Unfortunately, her daughter was repeating a lot of the same mistakes Gloria had made. Dwelling on the past was not only holding Gloria back from reaching her full potential, but it was also holding her daughter back from maturing into a responsible adult. Ruminating on the past won’t change it. Instead, wasting your time dwelling on what’s already happened will only lead to more problems in the future. Here are some of the ways that dwelling on the past can interfere with your ability to be your best self: • You miss out on the present. You can’t enjoy the present if your mind is constantly stuck in the past. You’ll miss out on experiencing new opportunities and celebrating the joys of today if you’re distracted by things that have already occurred. • Dwelling on the past makes it impossible to adequately prepare for the future. You won’t be able to clearly define your goals or stay motivated to create change when a big part of you remains stuck in the past. • Dwelling on the past interferes with your decision-making skills. When you have unresolved issues from the past, those conflicts will cloud your thinking. You won’t be able to adequately make healthy decisions about what’s best for you today when you can’t get over something that happened yesterday. • Dwelling on the past doesn’t solve anything. Replaying the same scripts in your head and focusing on things you no longer have control over won’t resolve anything. • Dwelling on the past can lead to depression. Ruminating on negative events conjures up negative emotions. And when you feel sad, the more likely you are to conjure up even more sad memories. Dwelling on past times can be a vicious cycle that keeps you stuck in the same emotional state. • Romanticizing the past—the grass-is-greener philosophy—isn’t helpful. It’s easy to convince yourself that you felt happier, more confident, and completely carefree back then. But there’s a good chance you’re exaggerating how great things used to be. It can also make you exaggerate how bad things are now. • Dwelling on the past is bad for your physical health. Thinking constantly about negative events increases inflammation in your body, according to a 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Ohio. Dwelling on the past could put you at a greater risk for diseases associated with heart disease, cancer, and dementia. STOP THE PAST FROM HOLDING YOU BACK Once Gloria recognized that she could learn from her past, rather than just beating herself up over it, her thinking shifted. She began changing her behavior and the way she parented her daughter. This helped her recognize how her past mistakes taught her valuable lessons about parenting. Over the course of a couple of months she was able to recall her earlier parenting mistakes without an overwhelming sense of shame. SHIFT YOUR THINKING Dwelling starts out as a cognitive process, but eventually it influences your emotions and behavior. By shifting the way you think about the past, you can move forward. • Schedule time to think about a past event. Sometimes our brains need a chance to sort things out and the more you tell yourself not to think about it, the more those memories can crop up throughout the day. Instead of battling to suppress the memories, remind yourself, I can think about that after dinner tonight. Then, after dinner, give yourself twenty minutes to think about it. When your time is up, move on to something else. • Give yourself something else to think about. Create a plan to help you think about something else. For example, decide that whenever you think about that job you didn’t get, you’ll shift your focus to thinking about planning your next vacation. This can be especially helpful if you’re prone to dwell on the negative right before you go to sleep at night. • Establish goals for the future. It’s impossible to dwell on the past if you’re planning for the future. Establish both short-term and long-term goals and begin working on the action steps needed to achieve those goals. It will give you something to look forward to while also preventing you from looking too much into the past. Our memories aren’t as accurate as we think they are. Often, when we recall unpleasant events, we exaggerate and catastrophize them. If you think about something you said during a meeting that you later regretted, you may envision that other people were reacting much more negatively than they actually did. When you recall negative memories, try these strategies to keep your experiences in perspective: • Focus on the lessons you learned. If you’ve endured hard times, focus on what you’ve learned from that experience. Accept that it happened and think about how you may be a changed person because of it, but realize that doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing. Maybe you learned to speak up because you allowed yourself to be treated poorly, or perhaps you learned that you need to be honest if you want relationships to last. Some of the best life lessons can be learned from the toughest times you’ve endured. • Think about the facts, not the emotion. Thinking about negative events can be very distressing because you’ll likely focus on how you felt during the event. But if you recall an event by walking yourself through the facts and details of the memory, your distress decreases. Instead of dwelling on how you felt when you went to a funeral, recall specific details about where you sat, what you wore, who was there. When you begin to take away the emotion surrounding an event, you’re less likely to dwell on it. • Look at the situation differently. When you review your past, examine what other ways there are to look at the same situation. You have control over how you weave the story. The same story can be told countless ways and still be true. If your current version is upsetting, see how else you can look at it. For example, Gloria could have reminded herself that her daughter’s current choices weren’t all related to her childhood. She could have recognized that although she may have made some mistakes, she was not responsible for the choices her daughter was making now. MAKE PEACE WITH THE PAST When James Barrie was six years old, his thirteen-year-old brother, David, died in an ice skating accident. Although his mother had ten children total, it was no secret that David had been her favorite. After his death, she was so distraught she could hardly cope with life. So at the age of six, Barrie did everything he could to compensate for his mother’s grief. He even tried to take over the role of David to help fill the void his mother felt from his death. He dressed in David’s clothing and learned how to whistle the same way David used to. He became her constant companion as he devoted his entire childhood to trying to make his mother smile again. Despite Barrie’s attempts to make his mother happy, she often warned him about the hardships of being an adult. She told him to never grow up because adulthood was only filled with grief and unhappiness. She even said she took some relief knowing that David would never have to grow up and face the realities of adulthood. In an attempt to please his mother, Barrie resisted maturity as much as he could. He especially didn’t want to grow any older than David had been when he’d passed away. He tried with all his might to remain a child. His attempts to stay a boy even seemed to stunt his physical growth as he hardly reached five feet tall. After he finished school, Barrie wanted to become an author. But his family pressured him to go on to study at a university, because that’s what David would have done. So Barrie found a compromise—he’d continue his education but he’d study literature. Barrie went on to pen one of the most famous works of children’s literature, Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up. Originally written as a play, which later became a famous movie, the main character, Peter Pan, faces the conflict between the innocence of childhood and the responsibility of adulthood. Peter chooses to remain a child and encourages all the other children to do the same. As the legendary fairy tale, it seems like a delightful children’s story. But when you know the author’s history, the anecdote is quite tragic. Barrie’s mother couldn’t move forward after the death of her son. She was convinced that childhood was the best time of her life and that the present and future were only riddled with pain and agony. As an extreme case of someone who dwelled on the past, she allowed it to interfere with the well-being of her children. It affected Barrie not just during his childhood, but also throughout his adulthood. The misconceptions we hold about grief can contribute to our choice to live in the past. Many people wrongly believe that the amount of time you grieve over someone is directly proportional to the amount of love you had for someone. If you cared a little about someone who died, you may grieve for months. But if you really loved that person, you’d grieve for years or even for the rest of your life. But the truth is, there isn’t a right amount of time to grieve. In fact, you may grieve for years, or even forever, but the amount of sadness you feel doesn’t equate to the amount of love you had for that person. Hopefully, you have many cherished memories of your loved one. But moving forward means actively working toward creating new memories for yourself, making the best decisions for you, and not always doing what someone else would want you to do. If you find yourself ruminating on some aspect of your past, you may need to take action to make peace with the past. Here are some ways to make peace with the past: • Give yourself permission to move forward. Sometimes you just need to give yourself permission to move forward. Moving forward doesn’t mean you have to leave your memories of a loved one behind, but it does mean you can do the things you need to do to enjoy the moment and get the most you can out of life. • Recognize the emotional toll of dwelling on the past versus moving forward. Sometimes dwelling on the past is a strategy that works in the short term but not in the long term. If you think about the past, you don’t have to focus on what’s going on right now. But, over the long term, there are consequences. Recognize what you’ll miss out on in life if your attention is focused on the past. • Practice forgiveness. Whether you’re dwelling on past hurt and anger because you can’t forgive yourself or because you can’t forgive someone else, forgiveness can help you let go of that hurt. Forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetting something happened. If someone hurt you, you can forgive them while still deciding not to have any more contact, for example. Instead, focus on letting go so you don’t stay consumed with the hurt and anger. • Change behavior that keeps you stuck in the past. If you find yourself avoiding certain activities—because you are afraid it will drudge up bad memories or because you feel like you don’t deserve to do them—consider doing them anyway. You can’t change the past. But you can choose to accept it. If you’ve made mistakes, you can’t go back and fix them or erase them. You may be able to try and take steps to repair some of the damage you’ve caused, but it won’t make everything better. • Seek professional help if necessary. Sometimes traumatic events can lead to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Near-death experiences, for example, can lead to flashbacks and nightmares that make it difficult to make peace with the past. Professional counseling can help reduce the distress associated with traumatic memories so you can move forward more productively. HOW MAKING PEACE WITH THE PAST WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER Wynona Ward grew up in rural Vermont. Her family was poor, and as in many homes in the area, domestic violence was common. Ward’s father routinely physically and sexually abused her. She often witnessed her father beating her mother. Although doctors treated her mother’s wounds and neighbors heard their screams, no one ever intervened. Ward kept her family problems a secret. She immersed herself in her academics and excelled in school. At the age of seventeen, she left home and got married. She and her husband became over-the-road truck drivers. After sixteen years of traveling the country as a truck driver, Ward learned that her older brother had abused a young family member. It was at that moment that she decided that she had to do something. She decided to go back to school so she could help put an end to the generational abuse that was going on within her family. Ward enrolled in the University of Vermont and studied from the truck while her husband drove. She completed her degree and went on to further her education at Vermont Law School. Upon getting her law degree, she used a small grant to start Have Justice Will Travel, an organization that serves families in rural areas affected by domestic violence. Ward provides rural domestic violence victims with free legal representation. She also connects them with the appropriate social services. Because many families lack the resources or transportation to travel to an office, Ward travels to them. She provides education and services that help families put an end to generational cycles of abuse. Instead of dwelling on her horrific past, Ward chooses to focus on what she can do to help other people in the present. Refusing to dwell on the past doesn’t mean you pretend the past didn’t happen. In fact, it often means embracing and accepting your experiences so you can live in the present. Doing so frees up your mental energy and allows you to plan for your future based on who you want to become, not who you used to be. Anger, shame, and guilt can run your life if you’re not careful. Letting go of those emotions helps you to be in charge of your life. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS If you spend all your time looking in the rearview mirror, you can’t look out the windshield. Staying stuck in the past will prevent you from enjoying the future. Recognize times when you’re dwelling on the past and take the steps necessary to heal your emotions so you can move forward. WHAT’S HELPFUL Reflecting on the past enough that you can learn from it Moving forward in your life, even when it may be painful to do so Actively working through grief so you can focus on the present and plan for the future Thinking about negative events in terms of facts, not emotions Finding ways to make peace with the past WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Trying to pretend the past didn’t happen Trying to prevent yourself from moving forward in life Focusing on what you’ve lost in life without being able to live in the present Replaying painful events in your mind repeatedly and focusing on how you felt during them Trying to undo the past or make up for your past mistakes","output":"From the passage provided, we learn several key lessons about healing from the past and living in the present: 1. **Dwelling on the Past is Counterproductive**: Constantly ruminating on past events, especially negative ones, can keep one stuck, unable to move forward and enjoy the present. It can also hinder one’s ability to prepare for the future. 2. **Acceptance and Forgiveness are Vital**: To stop dwelling on the past, it's important to accept what happened and learn to forgive oneself and others. This move helps to alleviate the burden of guilt and shame, which are obstacles to personal growth and happiness. 3. **Enabling vs. Helping**: In Gloria’s case, the recognition of her past parenting failures led her to enable her daughter’s irresponsible behavior. The solution was to set healthy boundaries and rules that encouraged her daughter to be more independent and responsible. 4. **The Importance of Self-reflection vs. Self-condemnation**: Reflecting on past actions to learn from them is productive, but self-condemnation leads to repeated negative cycles and prevents one from making positive changes. 5. **Dwelling on the Past can Affect the Future**: It can influence one’s decision-making skills and emotional state, and even have a negative impact on physical health. 6. **The Illusion of a Better Past**: Romanticizing the past or believing that \\"the grass was greener\\" can be an escape mechanism from present problems, but this rosy view is often inaccurate and prevents dealing with current issues head-on. 7. **Creating New Memories**: It is important to focus on making new, positive experiences rather than being trapped in old memories. 8. **Setting Goals and Looking Ahead**: Establishing future goals is a practical way to shift focus from the past to the future, creating a sense of purpose and direction. 9. **Professional Help May Be Needed**: For those who find it exceptionally difficult to move on from traumatic events, seeking professional help can be a necessary step towards healing. 10. **Transforming Pain into Purpose**: Wynona Ward’s story is an example of utilizing a painful past to fuel a purposeful present, showing that one’s difficult experiences can be channeled into positive actions that benefit both the individual and others. 11. **The Danger of Misconceptions About Grief**: Misunderstanding the nature of grief can lead to prolonged suffering. The duration of grief does not equate to the depth of love one had for the person who passed away. 12. **Embracing Change and Letting Go**: Part of healing from the past is being open to change and having the courage to let go of past self-identities, habits, and thoughts that no longer serve a positive purpose. The narrative also encompasses broader psychological principles of coping with the past, self-efficacy, personal responsibility, and the impacts of reflective practices on well-being. It underscores the message from Marianne Williamson that healing comes not from being anchored in the past but from engaging fully with the present moment."},{"instruction":"read it and this time write habits to follow","output":"Below are positive habits to cultivate based on the passage provided, which can promote healing from the past and encourage living fully in the present: 1. **Set Aside Intentional Reflection Time**: Allocate a specific time to reflect on past events rather than letting them randomly intrude upon your thoughts. This structured approach prevents constant rumination. 2. **Develop Mindfulness Practices**: Engage in mindfulness to bring your attention to the present. This can be through meditation, deep breathing, or other grounding techniques. 3. **Establish Healthy Boundaries**: Implement and uphold boundaries in relationships to avoid enabling destructive behavior in others as well as safeguarding your own well-being. 4. **Embrace Forgiveness**: Practice the art of forgiving yourself for past mistakes and forgive others to release the hold that resentment has on your life. 5. **Seek Positive Distractions**: When you find yourself dwelling on the past, redirect your thoughts to a constructive activity or engage in planning for something enjoyable. 6. **Create and Pursue Goals**: Identify short-term and long-term objectives and take active steps towards achieving them. This forward-thinking approach minimizes the tendency to dwell on the past. 7. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: When revisiting past events, challenge catastrophic thinking and reframe negative thoughts into lessons learned or neutral facts. 8. **Affirm the Good in the Present**: Practice gratitude by recognizing and affirming the positive aspects of your current life. 9. **Engage in Self-care**: Prioritize activities that promote emotional, physical, and mental health, like exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate rest. 10. **Seek Professional Support When Necessary**: If past events continue to cause significant distress, consult a mental health professional for strategies tailored to your personal healing process. 11. **Learn From Experience**: Reflect on what past experiences have taught you and how they’ve shaped you, turning them into valuable life lessons rather than sources of regret. 12. **Journaling**: Write down your feelings about past events as well as your current experiences to help process emotions and maintain focus on the present. 13. **Shift Your Narrative**: Re-write your mental story from a victim mindset to one of a survivor or proactive individual who has the power to shape their present and future. 14. **Volunteer or Give Back**: Like Wynona Ward, use your experiences to help others. This can be deeply healing and provide a sense of purpose. 15. **Rethink Grief and Healing**: Understand that moving on from grief isn’t a betrayal of memory but a necessary step towards living fully. 16. **Cultivate New Interests**: Pursue new hobbies, skills, or interests that can ignite passion and bring joy to your daily life. 17. **Practice Letting Go**: Consciously release attachments to material reminders of the past that no longer serve a positive purpose in your life. By cultivating these habits, you can work towards releasing the past's hold on you and live more freely and fully in the present moment."},{"instruction":"[told from the perspective of Iron Blood shipgirl Bismarck, there would be dialogue in this story:] (I was the top shipgirl in the main Azur Lane fleet. All around me were my fellow battleships - New Jersey, Queen Elizabeth, Mutsu, and even my sister Tirpitz. However, before I became a shipgirl, I was a German ship operator & actress. During the Second World War, I was brought on-board the KMS Bismarck - the first of her class. Little did I know that the day the Bismarck sank would be my last day as a human.)","output":"The salty sea breeze carried the weight of history as it caressed my skin, the thrum of the engine room below us keeping time with the pounding of the waves against steel. I stood on the deck of the KMS Bismarck, the pride of the Ironblood fleet, watching my fellow shipgirls as we prepared for the day's exercises. Each one was an embodiment of a legacy, and here I was, Bismarck, formerly a human but now a vessel for the soul of the warship I was named after. \\"I've been looking forward to this,\\" Queen Elizabeth said, adjusting the brim of her elegant hat. \\"Let's see what the pride of Ironblood has got.\\" \\"Keep your eyes on me, and perhaps you'll learn something,\\" I replied with a smirk, though I could not deny the thread of nostalgia that ran through me. I had lived and breathed within the walls of the real battleship, had touched its heart of steel. \\"Are we going to banter all day, or shall we demonstrate our prowess?\\" Mutsu inquired, her voice tinged with the wisdom of her historical experience. A chuckle escaped me, but before I could answer, an interruption came in the form of my steadfast sister. \\"Bismarck, let our actions speak for us today,\\" Tirpitz said softly, her eyes reflecting the same steely grey as the ship we represented. As we took our formations and prepared for the mock battle, a chorus of thoughts harmonized in my mind. Decades ago, my life had been profoundly altered in a matter of moments. I remember the roar of gunfire, the smell of smoke, and the desperate cacophony on the decks as we faced an overwhelming enemy. \\"Full speed ahead!\\" I had called out, my voice strained but clear. As an actress and operator aboard the Bismarck, I had performed for the crew, keeping morale high amidst the tensions of war. But that day, my performance was one of courage as the ship that bore my name navigated through the mayhem. I could barely recall the moment the torpedoes from a determined Royal Navy pierced her hull. I remembered the ferocity of the water as it claimed everything around me, the cold embrace of the sea as it stole the warmth from my body. The Bismarck sank, and with it, my human life. Now, as I engaged with the waves once more, not as a mere human but as the ship personified, I was gifted a second chance, a new purpose. The union of steel and spirit fortified my resolve. \\"Give it your all, Bismarck! Show no mercy!\\" New Jersey shouted as she advanced with her characteristic American gusto. The sound of artillery and simulated combat echoed around us, the recreation of a naval engagement far different from the grim reality I once faced. This was an exercise, a display of camaraderie disguised as competition among allies. Our foes were now our friends, the past a memory that shaped but did not confine us. As I led the charge, I found myself whispering to the soul of the battleship within me, \\"We are unyielding.\\" For I was Bismarck, the shipgirl and once a human, forever bound to the waves, forever striding forth with the Ironblood fleet at my side. Our history etched deep within us, our future unwritten but ever bright on the horizon."},{"instruction":"In a mud pool, a blue alien was swimming in the mud, Other creatures saw her, After a while, she submerged and then her legs resurfaced, which then danced gracefully, moving elegantly, Other creatures marvelled at the beauty, Eventually with a splash, her legs vanished underneath, leaving only small bubbles to mark her presence, The mud would later bubble more, and then a bubbling spectacle began, Write a continuation where mud squirts into the air, as if a fountain, Bubbles appear like fireworks As the small bubbles continued to mark the blue alien’s submerged presence in the thick, viscous mud pool, the other creatures, who had paused their own play to observe, now waited in silent anticipation. Moments passed, and the mud began to churn more violently, the surface roiling with energy. Without warning, the serene scene erupted as a powerful jet of mud squirted high into the air, mimicking the grandeur of an earthen fountain. The sudden spectacle elicited gasps and chirps from the assembled creatures, their eyes wide with amazement. It was as though the blue alien, hidden from view, was the conductor of an orchestra, and the mud pool her instrument, playing a symphony of the earth. The stream of mud ascended skyward before succumbing to gravity, splattering back down with a multitude of satisfying plops, decorating the surrounding landscape with a fresh, muddy coat. As the initial geyser subsided, a series of smaller spouts followed in quick succession. Like a crescendo in nature’s symphony, the mud exploded upward, again and again, each burst higher and more forceful, bathing the area in a soft rain of earth. The timing of these eruptions became almost rhythmic, as if pulsing to the heartbeat of the planet itself. Then, as if choreographed by an unseen artist, bubbles formed at the surface, each catching the light in a dazzling display of iridescence. They danced and weaved amongst the sprays of mud, creating a natural spectacle akin to fireworks. The bubbles shimmered with vibrant colors, buoyed by the blue alien’s mysterious powers, seeming to celebrate the joy and wonder of this unique cosmic ballet. Eyes squinted and heads tilted back, the creatures watched the grand performance, a spontaneous testament to the magic hidden within their familiar mud pool. The laughter of gurgling bubbles and the spectacle of the continuously cascading muddy fountain blended into an unforgettable display, forever etched in the annals of this world’s natural wonders. The blue alien, still unseen below the surface, held the gaze of every creature present, her aquatic dance a mystery that enticed and enchanted, leaving them to wonder what other marvels existed just beneath the cover of their simple, muddy paradise. Write a finale where the bubbles slow down and stop, and then she resurfaces The exuberant display of mud and bubbling continued for what felt like an ageless moment, captivating the audience of creatures who had never witnessed such an event. But all performances, no matter how enthralling, must eventually draw to a close. Slowly, as if the energy were being drained from the spectacle, the mud fountains grew less forceful, the eruptions coming at longer intervals. The bubbles, which had soared like vibrant fireworks moments before, began to diminish in size and number. The color-infused orbs that had ascended to the heavens now rose only a few feet before softly bursting, leaving behind a fine mist that hovered over the settling pool. All eyes remained transfixed on the surface of the mud, which gently rocked and rippled as the last few bubbles perished with muted pops. The creatures’ breathing slowed in unison with the fading energy, anticipation building in the silent stillness that now hugged the area. The pool stilled to an eerie calmness, and the lively performance that had erupted without warning seemed now to be just a fond memory. Just as the creatures started to consider that the mysterious show might be over, the mud trembled one last time. It was a subtle quiver, but enough to send waves of excitement through the onlookers. Then, with a grace that matched the dance of her earlier performance, the blue alien resurfaced. Her head emerged first, covered in glistening mud that dripped from her features. Then, her shoulders and torso, the rest of her sinuous form following, as the blue alien rose majestically from the depths. The mud slipped off her skin, revealing its luminescent azure hue, which shone even more brightly against the muted earth tones of her surroundings. As she stood in the shallows of the pool, the mud sliding away to reveal her true form, the creatures approached with a mix of reverence and awe. The blue alien greeted them with a smile that acknowledged their appreciation. With a fluid motion, she beckoned them to come closer, inviting them to share in the newfound serenity of the mud pool, a bond formed through the shared experience of her enchanting performance. The air was filled with a sense of peace and wonder, and as the blue alien mingled with the other creatures, the moments of high excitement transformed into a collective appreciation for the beauty and mystery of their world. The extraordinary had touched the ordinary, leaving a sense of magic that would resonate in their hearts for times to come. The finale, marked by the alien’s gentle resurfacing, had sealed an indelible connection between all who had witnessed the dance of mud and bubbles, a connection that transcended the boundaries of their differing existences. Write a story where she goes back to her planet, a young pig saying goodbye","output":"After the day's miraculous events, the creatures of the mud pool returned to their habitual activities, yet the air remained thick with the inexplicable enchantment of the blue alien's performance. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting hues of orange and pink across the sky, the blue alien gazed upwards, her attention fixed on the emerging stars twinkling in the dusk. She knew the time had come to return to her own world, a distant planet she had left to explore and understand the vast wonders of the universe. Before departing, the blue alien desired to express her gratitude to the remarkable friends she had made on this lush, green planet. As she prepared to leave, a young pig, who had watched the alien's aquatic dance with unwavering delight, waddled forward through the mud. His eyes shone with a mixture of sadness and curiosity, a silent question about the vast cosmos that lay beyond his simple earthly home. The alien knelt down to the pig's level, her eyes meeting his. With a tenderness that transcended the need for words, she reached out and touched the small creature's snout. A warm, shimmering glow passed between them, a gift of farewell and a promise of remembering. The pig, for his part, mustered the bravest smile he could, his little heart full of bittersweet emotion. He knew the blue alien had to leave, but her visit would forever be etched in his memory. The blue alien stood upright, her gaze once again shifting to the sky. Suddenly, the air around her began to pulse with energy, and a soft hum filled the evening. A beam of light descended from the stars, enveloping the blue alien in its otherworldly glow. As the creatures of the mud pool looked on, the alien gave one final, nod—her farewell to the friends she had made and the planet that had shown her such beauty and warmth. With a burst of light, the blue alien ascended, her form dissolving into the beam as she was drawn back to her celestial home. The young pig, along with the other creatures, watched until the last trace of light disappeared into the velvet night sky, leaving behind the gentle sounds of the nocturnal world awakening. The young pig, touched by the blue alien's parting gift, reflected on the wonder of the day. Though he could not chase after the stars as the alien did, he knew that part of her would always remain with him. The mud pool, once a place of simple pleasures, had become a site of profound discovery. In the days and years that followed, the young pig often found himself gazing upward at the twinkling expanse, retelling the story of the blue alien to any who would listen. And sometimes, just sometimes, when the conditions were just right, and the air hummed in the familiar way it did on that fateful evening, the young pig could see a distant star sparkling brighter than the rest—winking in the darkness—as if to say, \\"Remember.\\" And he always would."},{"instruction":"I am trying to check if my prompt works in achieving a certain output with an LLM consistently.

Digit 5: Person A has '4', and Person B has '4'. Match! Digit 4: Person A has '5', and Person B has '5'. Match! Digit 3: Person A has '6', and Person B has '6'. Match! Digit 2: Person A has '7', and Person B has '6'. No match! Digit 1: Person A has '1', and Person B has '1'. Match! How can I ensure that such things do not happen again","output":"To minimize the occurrence of such errors in SSN comparisons by the model, you can attempt to reformulate your instructional prompts to be even clearer and more structured in their guidance. Below is a refined version of the instructions with a step-by-step outline to reduce the likelihood of errors: [INST] When comparing Social Security Numbers (SSN) between Person A and Person B, carry out the following steps: 1. Remove all non-numeric characters including hyphens (-), forward slashes (/), spaces, and any other non-digit symbols from each SSN. 2. Check that the remaining string for each SSN consists only of digits. Confirm that each SSN has exactly 9 digits. 3. Compare each corresponding digit from both SSNs, starting from the first digit on the left moving towards the last digit on the right. 4. If all 9 digits between Person A and Person B match sequentially, assign a score of 1. If any of the digits do not match, assign a score of 0. Provide the score in a JSON object structured as follows: \`\`\` { \\"ssn\\": [score] } \`\`\` Ensure accurate and consistent comparison results with no additional commentary. The outcome should solely reflect whether the SSNs match or not after normalization. [/INST] This refined prompt removes any ambiguity by emphasizing a left-to-right digit comparison, and by explicitly reminding the model to check for a total of nine digits, the prompt can help prevent errors. Despite refining the prompt, it's fundamental to understand that machine learning models, including large language models, are inherently statistical and might still be prone to occasional errors when processing data. While the prompt formulation can greatly reduce inconsistencies, no method is entirely foolproof within natural language processing. In a production scenario where precision is critical, the best approach would be to use a dedicated validation and comparison software or to deploy programmatic methods in combination with regular expressions to handle data validation. Programming languages such as Python are well-suited for such tasks and can ensure absolute adherence to numerical comparison rules."},{"instruction":"Also, I want the model to account for common date formats used across the world so that it does not give false negative results if the formats are different","output":"Certainly! When comparing dates of birth (DOB), handling multiple world date formats is critical to avoiding false negatives due to varying formats. In your instructions to the model, you should emphasize the importance of recognizing and standardizing these different date formats to ensure an accurate comparison. Here is an improved set of instructions specifically focused on date comparison: [INST] To compare the Date of Birth (DOB) between Person A and Person B, perform the following steps: 1. Recognize and accept common date formats from around the world, which include, but are not limited to: - MM/DD/YYYY - DD/MM/YYYY - YYYY/MM/DD - Month DD, YYYY (e.g., January 01, 2000) - DD Month YYYY (e.g., 01 January 2000) 2. Normalize both dates by converting them to a consistent format. The suggested normalized format is YYYYMMDD, which eliminates ambiguities. 3. Remove all non-numeric characters like hyphens (-), forward slashes (/), spaces, and commas from the normalized dates. 4. After normalization, compare the sequences of digits representing the DOBs. If the normalized sequences match perfectly, assign a score of 1. If they do not match, assign a score of 0. Provide the comparison score in JSON format as follows: \`\`\` { \\"dob\\": [score] } \`\`\` The output must be given in strict JSON format as shown, considering all the stated constraints to ensure that different world date formats do not lead to false negatives, and to provide consistency in the comparison results. [/INST] To further ensure proper handling by the model, you can include examples of the normalization process within the instructions. However, do be aware that language models perform text-based operations and aren't inherently designed to recognize dates or perform date conversions. For precise date handling, you should consider using a dedicated date parsing library (such as \`dateutil\` in Python), which can accurately interpret a wide variety of date formats and handle normalization systematically. The approach recommended above, within the limitations of a language model's capabilities, should reduce the risk of false negatives due to date format differences in your comparison outcomes."},{"instruction":"Also, I want the model to not assign any partial scores for any parameter","output":"To ensure that the model does not assign any partial scores and only provides a binary score of 0 or 1 for each parameter, you can incorporate this guideline explicitly into your instructions. Here is how you can articulate your instructions: [INST] When comparing personal information between Person A and Person B, provide a binary score (1 for a match and 0 for no match) for each of the following parameters: SSN, first name, middle name, last name, DOB, street name, city, state name, and zip code. Do not assign partial scores; only full matches are to be assigned a score of 1. The comparison criteria are as follows: - SSN: Remove hyphens, slashes, and spaces, then compare the sequence of digits. A score of 1 is given only if all normalized digits match exactly. - First Name: Score 1 for an exact match, accounting for common nicknames and initials. Otherwise, score 0. - Middle Name: Score 1 if the initial matches (without considering periods). Otherwise, score 0. - Last Name: Score 1 for an exact match. Otherwise, score 0. - DOB: Recognize and properly convert common world date formats into a consistent numeric format (e.g., YYYYMMDD), then compare the sequence of digits. A score of 1 is given only if the normalized dates match exactly. - Address: Evaluate street name, city, state name, and zip code separately. Score 1 for an exact match on each component, accounting for common abbreviations. Otherwise, score 0. Render the comparison results in the following strict JSON format: \`\`\` { \\"ssn\\": [score], \\"name\\": { \\"first_name\\": [score], \\"middle_name\\": [score], \\"last_name\\": [score] }, \\"dob\\": [score], \\"address\\": { \\"street name\\": [score], \\"city\\": [score], \\"state name\\": [score], \\"zip code\\": [score] } } \`\`\` A score of 1 represents an exact match for the respective parameter, while a score of 0 represents no match or any discrepancy, no matter how small. Ensure the response: - Strictly adheres to the described scoring system without partiality. - Stays true to the JSON format provided, with the specified keys and scores as values. - Reflects a binary scoring approach without any introduction of partial scores. [/INST] By affirmatively stating that only full matches should receive a score and by structurally reinforcing the binary nature of scoring for all parameters, this directive will reduce the likelihood of the model assigning partial scores. It makes very clear that the only acceptable scores are 0 or 1, aligning with your request for a strict binary approach to comparisons."},{"instruction":"How can I ask the model to give me accurate responses and not hallucinate while going creative trying to give me different answers?","output":"When interacting with language models such as OpenAI's GPT models, it's important to set clear expectations and boundaries within your prompts to minimize the possibility of receiving creative or \\"hallucinated\\" responses that deviate from fact-based accuracy. Here's how you can craft a prompt to guide the model toward accurate, factual, and non-creative responses: [INSTRUCTION] You are to provide factual and accurate information based on the input data given. Your responses must be direct and based solely on the evidence within the provided data. Do not generate or infer information that goes beyond what is explicitly presented. Your task is not to create, assume, or predict information, but to analyze and report on the data as is. Remain objective, analytical, and precise in your output, avoiding any form of creative elaboration or fictional content creation. [/INSTRUCTION] Then you would follow this with your specific question or task for the model. Here are some additional tips on how to ask the model for accurate and reliable information: - **Be Specific:** Clearly outline the task at hand with as much detail as possible, which helps the model understand exactly what you're asking for and reduces the likelihood of it generating irrelevant content. - **Set Limits on Creativity:** If your query does not require creative writing, clearly state that you are looking for factual information only and that the model should not generate responses beyond the provided data. - **Request Evidence or References:** Even though the model cannot provide external references (due to not having direct access to the internet), asking it to base its responses on evidence or data can guide it towards more factual responses. - **Use Instructional Prompts:** Leveraging the instructional format (as in [INSTRUCTION]...[/INSTRUCTION]) allows you to guide the LLM with specific operational frameworks, which can help reduce the chance of hallucination. Remember that no matter how carefully a prompt is constructed, language models can still occasionally produce errors or generate content that may not be entirely factual. Their responses are based on patterns learned from training data, and while they excel at many tasks, they are not infallible. They may sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or irrelevant information, especially when the task involves interpreting complex data or requires knowledge that the model might not have been trained on. For tasks that require absolute accuracy, such as legal, medical, or safety-critical information, it is advised to verify the information with human experts or authoritative sources."},{"instruction":"When comparing middle names, I want the model to give a score of 1 if the first digits are the same. For example if the middle name is Elizabeth and the person has written E. They should get a complete score","output":"To ensure that the language model understands and correctly applies your criteria for scoring middle names based on the first digit (which in the context of names would typically refer to the first letter of the middle name), you can specify this rule in the instructions. Here's how you might phrase the prompt to guide the model: [INSTRUCTION] When comparing the middle names of two individuals, apply the following rule for scoring: - Middle Name: Score 1 if the first letter of the middle name matches the first letter of the other individual's middle name initial, even if one is just an initial and the other is a full middle name. For instance, if Person A has the middle name \\"Elizabeth\\" and Person B has the middle initial \\"E.\\", then assign a score of 1. The presence of a period after the initial should not affect the score. If the first letters do not match, assign a score of 0. Provide the comparison scores in the JSON format below, reflecting the binary scoring system for the parameters compared: \`\`\` { \\"name\\": { \\"middle_name\\": [score] } } \`\`\` Ensure that the scoring strictly adheres to the middle name comparison rule provided, without introducing any partial scores or inconsistencies. The response should be factual, based on the direct comparison of data, and in alignment with the specified scoring criteria. [/INSTRUCTION] By giving the model a clear and unambiguous rule regarding how to score middle names, you reduce the risk of it applying a different scoring method. Emphasizing that even an initial is acceptable if it corresponds with the first letter of the full middle name helps ensure that the model understands and applies your desired scoring logic."},{"instruction":"The model keeps giving me extra text in the output other than the JSON which I do not require. How can I ensure that it does not do that?","output":"To ensure that the model provides output strictly in JSON format without any extra text, you need to include explicit instructions that forbid the addition of any text outside of the JSON object. Here is how you can phrase the prompt to communicate this requirement: [INSTRUCTION] Provide the output exclusively in JSON format. The response must contain only the JSON object with the specified keys and associated comparison scores as values, with no additional text, commentary, or explanations outside the JSON structure. Any output not complying with these instructions, including extra text before, after, or within the JSON object, is unacceptable. [/INSTRUCTION] You could then proceed to outline your task in detail following this instruction to set the stage for the required JSON output. Here's a sample to illustrate how you can combine the instruction with your specific task: [INSTRUCTION] Provide the comparison scores strictly in the JSON format specified below. Do not include any text, explanations, or content that is not part of the JSON object. Ensure that your response only includes this JSON structure with the appropriate values filled in: \`\`\` { \\"ssn\\": [score], \\"name\\": { \\"first_name\\": [score], \\"middle_name\\": [score], \\"last_name\\": [score] }, \\"dob\\": [score], \\"address\\": { \\"street_name\\": [score], \\"city\\": [score], \\"state_name\\": [score], \\"zip_code\\": [score] } } \`\`\` Every score should be represented as a numerical value, either 0 or 1, based on whether the comparison is a match or not. No partial scores or additional details are required or permitted. [/INSTRUCTION] By including this directive at the beginning of every interaction, you clearly set the expectation for the format of the response. You can reinforce this requirement as needed by reiterating it within your prompts. This should help guide the model to give responses that adhere strictly to the JSON format and contain no additional unwarranted text."},{"instruction":"when prompting a model what does <s> </s> do?","output":"The \`<s>\` and \`</s>\` tags are traditionally used in HTML or XML as part of the strikethrough text markup, where they indicate that the text between these tags should be rendered with a line through the middle, signifying that it is deleted, corrected, or no longer relevant. In the context of language models like OpenAI's GPT-3, these tags could potentially be part of a custom syntax for special instructions or processing steps. However, without specific context on how they are intended to be used within the language model's interface or API, it's difficult to say definitively what function they would serve. If these tags are used by a particular application or developer to convey a specific meaning or action to the language model, that meaning would be defined by the custom implementation of the application or the API's processing logic. The language model itself does not inherently assign any special function to these tags unless trained or programmed to do so in the context of a specific task or prompt. It's important to check the documentation of the specific language model or application you are using to understand the intended function of any custom tagging or markup within prompts. If the \`<s>\` and \`</s>\` tags are not explicitly documented to have a special function, they might be treated as plain text by the model. If you are experiencing unexpected behavior or outputs from the model related to these tags, providing additional context or consulting the relevant documentation would be the best next steps to clarify their purpose."},{"instruction":"in ssn comparison the model is still assuming stuff, which is causing confusion","output":"If the model is assuming information and causing confusion in SSN comparison, providing an unambiguous example with clear instructions on the comparison method could help guide the model. You may need to emphasize that the comparison should be done without making assumptions or inferences, and that the model should only compare the numeric values after normalizing the input. Here is how you can structure a prompt to help mitigate assumptions: [INSTRUCTION] Your task is to compare the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) from Person A and Person B by following the steps outlined below: 1. Normalize each SSN by stripping out all non-numeric characters, including hyphens (-), slashes (/), and spaces. 2. Ensure that the normalized SSN contains exactly nine digits, no more, no less. 3. Compare the two normalized SSNs on a digit-by-digit basis. The SSNs match only if all nine digits are identical in the same order. 4. Provide a comparison score: assign a score of 1 if the SSNs match exactly, and a score of 0 if there is any discrepancy between them. Important: Do not assume or infer any information. Base your comparison strictly on the processed numeric values of the SSNs after normalization. Output your response in the form of a JSON object that only contains the score of the comparison, nothing else. The output must be formatted as follows: \`\`\` { \\"ssn\\": [score] } \`\`\` [/INSTRUCTION] Providing the model with an explicit instruction set that outlines what actions to take and removes any need for inference should help avoid any potential confusion in the SSN comparison task. Reiterating that assumptions should not be made, and that scoring is based only on numeric comparison post-normalization, clarifies the expected output."},{"instruction":"Amend, revise, and personalize the following letter where applicable: Cameron McCaffrey c/o Boca Raton Achievement Center 500 NE Spanish River Blvd., Suite 30 Boca Raton, FL 33431 cmccaff1@fau.edu <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PHONE_NUMBER> Thursday, February 1, 2024 Mr. Armando Christian Pérez (Pitbull) c/o Island Management Company 4700 Biscayne Blvd., Suite 900 Miami, FL 33173 Dear Mr. Pérez (Pitbull), I hope this letter finds you basking in the afterglow of your recent endeavors, including the exhilaration of your upcoming pre-race show at the 2024 Daytona 500.

With sincere admiration and hope, Cameron McCaffrey – Volunteer, Boca Raton Achievement Center Use the following information as a point of reference: Armando Christian Pérez (born January 15, 1981), known professionally as Pitbull, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, businessman and actor from Miami, Florida. He began his career in the early 2000s and recorded reggaeton, Latin hip hop, and crunk music under a multitude of labels. His debut studio album, M.I.A.M.I. (2004) was released through TVT Records and executive produced by Lil Jon. It moderately entered the Billboard 200, along with his second and third albums, El Mariel (2006) and The Boatlift (2007).[4] His fourth album, Pitbull Starring in Rebelution (2009) was his supported by his mainstream breakthrough singles, \\"I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)\\" and \\"Hotel Room Service\\", which peaked at numbers two and eight on the US Billboard Hot 100. After rebranding himself as a pop artist, Pitbull's sixth and seventh albums, Planet Pit (2011) and Global Warming (2012) achieved further commercial success; the former spawned his first single to peak the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Give Me Everything\\" (featuring Ne-Yo, Afrojack and Nayer), while the latter spawned the top ten hit \\"Feel This Moment\\" (featuring Christina Aguilera).[5] His 2013 single, \\"Timber\\" (featuring Kesha) became his second song to peak the chart, and did so in 18 other countries. His 2014 single, \\"Time of Our Lives\\" (with Ne-Yo) peaked within the chart's top ten and led his eighth album, Globalization (2014). That same year, he performed the song \\"We Are One (Ole Ola)\\" (with Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte), which served as the official theme of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, Pitbull made numerous guest appearances on a number of hit songs, including the Billboard Hot 100-top four singles \\"I Like It\\" by Enrique Iglesias, \\"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love\\" by Usher, and \\"On the Floor\\" by Jennifer Lopez. His subsequent albums, Dale (2015) and Climate Change (2017) trailed commercially. His eleventh album and first independent release, Libertad 548 (2019) focused on Latin hip hop and was led by the singles \\"No Lo Trates\\" (with Daddy Yankee and Natti Natasha) and \\"Me Quedaré Contigo\\" (featuring Ne-Yo). His twelfth album, Trackhouse (2023) delved further into Latin influences. Pitbull has sold over 25 million studio albums and over 100 million singles worldwide. He has over 15 billion views on YouTube as of May 2020.[6] He was ranked by Billboard as the 45th Top Artist of the 2010s and the 24th Top Latin Artist of the 2010s.[7][8] Pitbull's other ventures include brand ambassadorship and for various entities, activism and philanthropy in Latino American communities, a radio station—Pitbull's Globalization—on Sirius XM Radio, and ownership of the Trackhouse Racing NASCAR team.[9] As of May 2019, Pitbull has won 35 Billboard Latin Music Awards.[10][11]","output":"Cameron McCaffrey Volunteer, Boca Raton Achievement Center 500 NE Spanish River Blvd., Suite 30 Boca Raton, FL 33431 cmccaff1@fau.edu <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PHONE_NUMBER> February 1, 2024 Mr. Armando Christian Pérez (Pitbull) c/o Island Management Company 4700 Biscayne Blvd., Suite 900 Miami, FL 33137 Dear Mr. Pérez (Pitbull), I hope this message greets you with the same vibrant energy that surrounds your celebrated performances.

Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey – Volunteer, Boca Raton Achievement Center Use the following information as a point of reference: Robert John Renzetti is an American animator and author. Renzetti is known for creating My Life as a Teenage Robot and the Oh Yeah! Cartoons series Mina and the Count for Nickelodeon, directing Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, and Samurai Jack for Cartoon Network and serving as the animation director of Sym-Bionic Titan. He was also the supervising producer on the Disney Channel animated television series Gravity Falls and an executive producer on Big City Greens. He most recently served as story editor and co-executive producer on Kid Cosmic for Netflix and released his first original novel, The Horrible Bag of Terrible Things. Early life Renzetti, born in Chicago and raised in Addison, Illinois, was an art history major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[1][2] After graduating from Illinois, Renzetti attended the animation program at Columbia College Chicago for one year, where he was a classmate of Genndy Tartakovsky. Renzetti and Tartakovsky were then each accepted into the California Institute of the Arts, where they were roommates.[3] Career After graduating from the California Institute of the Arts, Renzetti began his animating career in Spain, working on 5 episodes for Batman: The Animated Series.[3] Renzetti has been writer, director, and storyboard artist for several Cartoon Network shows, including 2 Stupid Dogs, Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. He won an Emmy award in 2009 for his work on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. During the mid-1990s, he created Mina and the Count, a series of animated shorts that premiered on the What a Cartoon! show then later aired for a short time on the similar anthology series Oh Yeah! Cartoons. In 1999, he made the short \\"My Neighbor Was a Teenage Robot\\", which also debuted on Oh Yeah! Cartoons; in 2003, My Life as a Teenage Robot, based on the short, debuted on Nickelodeon. In April 2008, he started work on Cartoon Network's The Cartoonstitute project as supervising producer. He was story editor on My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic for the series' first two seasons, but left in 2011, soon after the departure of the series showrunner, Lauren Faust, to work as the supervising producer on Disney's Gravity Falls. He subsequently worked on Disney's Big City Greens as one of its executive producers.[4] He was most recently co-executive producer on Kid Cosmic for Netflix. Renzetti has (co-)written four books based on various Disney properties, including Dipper's and Mabel's Guide to Mystery and Nonstop Fun!, the New York Times Bestseller Gravity Falls: Journal 3, DuckTales: Solving Mysteries and Rewriting History, and Onward: Quests Of Yore. His first original novel, The Horrible Bag of Terrible Things, was released in July 2023.

My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and I am someone who holds great respect for the vivacity and depth you breathe into the world of animation, as well as the empathy that your actions have continually radiated within the industry. I am writing to you in my capacity as a volunteer at a place very special to me, the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC). Our center is a nexus of hope and progression for the young minds diagnosed with autism and related disabilities.

My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and I’m a volunteer at the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC), a harbor of hope and empowerment for young individuals with autism and related disabilities. I find a deep connection with the mission of BRAC, having been diagnosed with Asperger’s myself at a young age. My journey has not been without its trials, including the heart-wrenching loss of both my beloved parents in a span of nine days back in October 2023. The pain was profound, but with the support of remarkable people like BRAC’s Executive Director, Evelyn Falconer, I’ve been striving to find steady ground and purpose. It is with great admiration for your humanitarian spirit that I reach out, hoping to discuss the possibility of inviting you to visit our center. Your presence would not only shine a spotlight on the important work we do but could serve as a profound source of inspiration to our students who face daily challenges to achieve their own version of greatness.

With the greatest respect and anticipation, Cameron McCaffrey Volunteer at Boca Raton Achievement Center Use the following information as a point of reference: Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal (/ʃəˈkiːl/ shə-KEEL; born March 6, 1972), known commonly as Shaq (/ʃæk/ SHAK), is an American former professional basketball player who is a sports analyst on the television program Inside the NBA. He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.[2][3][4][5] After playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O'Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[6] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[7] O'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award; the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award; 15 All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards; three Finals MVP awards; two scoring titles; 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds, and 8th in blocks. O'Neal was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996.[8] Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O'Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%) and led the league in field goal percentage ten times.[9] O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.[10] He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.[11] In October 2021, O'Neal was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[12] In addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, Shaq Diesel, going platinum. O'Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as DIESEL.[13] He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, Shaq's Big Challenge and Shaq Vs. He hosts The Big Podcast with Shaq.[14] He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.[15] Early life O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 1988–89 O'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey,[16] to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's Jamaican stepfather, Phillip Arthur Harrison, a career Army sergeant.[17][18] O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.[18] On his 1994 rap album, Shaq Fu: The Return, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song \\"Biological Didn't Bother\\", dismissing him with the line \\"Phil is my father.\\" However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, \\"I don't hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil.\\"[19] O'Neal came from a tall family. His father and mother were 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall, respectively, and by age 13, O'Neal was already 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall. He credited the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. \\"It gave me something to do,\\" he said. \\"I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team.\\"[20] Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.[21] After returning from Germany, O'Neal's family settled in San Antonio, Texas. By age 16, O'Neal had grown to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), and he began playing basketball at Robert G. Cole High School. He led his team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.[22] His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.[23] O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, No. 33. However, his high school team did not have a 33 jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear No. 32 before college.[24] College career After graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University (LSU). He had first met Tigers coach Dale Brown years earlier in Europe when O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI. O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player.[25] He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame.[26] A 900-pound (410 kg) bronze statue of O'Neal is located in front of the LSU Basketball Practice Facility.[27] Professional career Orlando Magic (1992–1996) Rookie of the Year (1992–1993) The Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.[28] O'Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey.[24] O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so.[29] During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.[30] The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, \\"We've got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].\\"[31] First playoff appearance (1993–1994) In 1993–1994, O'Neal's second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office.[32] O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O'Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks.[33] He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee \\"Penny\\" Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.[34] In his first playoff series, O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds[35][unreliable source] as the Pacers swept the Magic.[36][failed verification] First scoring title and NBA Finals (1994–1996) In O'Neal's third season, 1994–95, he led the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average, while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first-ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals. After beating Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.[37] O'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference finals. Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004) O'Neal–Bryant tandem buildup (1996–1999) In 8 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004), O'Neal won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 and appeared in the 2004 NBA Finals. O'Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[38][39] 82% answered \\"no\\".[38] O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill.[40][41] He said the team \\"just didn't respect [Hill]\\".[42] Another question in the poll asked whether O'Neal was worth 115 million, in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer; 91.3% of the response said it was not.[39][40] O'Neal's Olympic teammates teased him over the poll.[39][41] He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry.[38] O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to \\"feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond\\".[43] He also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him.[44] On the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, the media announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, 121 million contract.[45][46] O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \\"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\\"[47][48] The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season.[49] O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games.[50] In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \\"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\\"[51] The following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.[52] With the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased; however, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999. MVP and championship seasons (1999–2002) O'Neal during Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals In 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him \\"the [NBA's] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.\\"[53] In the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game was the last game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer until Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 64 points against the Indiana Pacers on December 13, 2023.[56] O'Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.[57] In the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. \\"I didn't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It's a shame that the referees buy into that\\", O'Neal said. \\"I wish he'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.[58] A month before the 2001–02 season's training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.[59] He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.[60] He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.[59] In January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players.[61] O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined 15,000.[62] For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.[59] Matched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O'Neal said, \\"There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t.\\" O'Neal meant \\"cheat\\" in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings' center Vlade Divac. O'Neal referred to Divac as \\"she\\", and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. \\"I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.\\"[63] After the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.[59] Using Jackson's triangle offense, O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.[64] Toe surgery to departure (2002–2004) O'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery.[65] He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe.[66] He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, \\"I got hurt on company time, so I'll heal on company time.\\"[67] O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.[66] The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[68] At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003. For the 2003–04 season, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of two aging stars—forward Karl Malone and guard Gary Payton—but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either player nearly as much money as he could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for 30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, \\"Pay me.\\"[69] There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003–2004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized O'Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the team.[70] The Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, \\"Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding\\".[71] After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade.[72] Winter said, \\"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\\"[73] Miami Heat (2004–2008) MVP runner-up (2004–2005) O'Neal with Miami in 2007 On July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname \\"Flash\\". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.[74] Despite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference finals and a game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.[75] In August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for 100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than 20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[76] Fourth championship (2005–2006) In the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities.[67] O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a \\"frontrunner\\" and a \\"master of panic.\\"[77] Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview \\"Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game.\\"[78] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.[79] On April 11, 2006, O'Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists.[80] O'Neal finished the 2005–06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.[80] O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House In the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat held on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.[81] In the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81] Surgery and Wade's injury (2006–2007) In the 2006–07 season, O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery.[82][83] After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as \\"Benedict Arnold\\". Jackson had previously said, \\"The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker... is probably Shaq.\\"[84] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[85] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[85] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[86] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[85] In a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.[9] Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008) O'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \\"all that good\\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91] O'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007–08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game. Following the trade to Phoenix, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points while starting all 28 games with the Suns. Phoenix Suns (2008–2009) The Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9–37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[92] O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008, against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: \\"I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn't in tune with the guys [...] But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I'll get it.\\"[93] In 28 regular season games, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds,[94] good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.[95] O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.[94] O'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. \\"I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys\\", O'Neal said. \\"We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again.\\" Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the \\"great Pat Riley\\" while playing for the Heat.[96] O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.[97] They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.[98] The 2008–09 season improved for O'Neal, who averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division.[99] He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant. O'Neal with Phoenix teammate Steve Nash On February 27, 2009, O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113. In a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. \\"I'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds\\", O'Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. \\"It's not really my role anymore.\\" O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. \\"I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool\\", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was \\"very disappointed cause [O'Neal] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.\\"[100] O'Neal responded, \\"Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.\\"[101] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since \\"everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back.\\"[102] In a 2006 interview in TIME, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would \\"Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.\\"[103] On March 6, O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. \\"It's not going to be man-on-man, so don't even try that,\\" says O'Neal with an incredulous laugh. \\"They're going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play [Yao] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it's just going to be me down there. So don't try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it's Shaq versus four other guys.\\"[104] The 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs.[105] Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010) On June 25, 2009, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic, Ben Wallace, 500,000, and a 2010 second-round draft pick.[106] Upon arriving in Cleveland, O'Neal said, \\"My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King\\", referring to LeBron James.[107] James was the leader of the team, and O'Neal deferred to him.[108] On February 25, 2010, O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics.[109] He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs.[110] After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round. In September 2016, O'Neal said: \\"When I was in Cleveland, we were in first place. Big Baby [Glen Davis] breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year. I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs, and we lost to Boston in the second round. I was upset. I know for a fact if I was healthy, we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring.\\"[111] O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009–10 season, taking on a much less significant role than in previous years. Boston Celtics (2010–2011) O'Neal finished his career with the Boston Celtics. Upon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal.[112] Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.[113] On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[114] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of 2.8 million.[115] O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.[116] The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands.[117][118] He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[119] O'Neal said he did not \\"compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe.\\" O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: \\"If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that.\\"[120] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit.[120] Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.[121] O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg[122] including knee,[123] calf,[124] hip,[125] and Achilles injuries.[126] The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[122] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[127] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[122][128] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[129] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[130][131] On June 1, 2011, O'Neal announced his retirement via social media.[132][133] On a short video on Twitter, O'Neal tweeted, \\"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\\" On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.[134] National team career While in college, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner.[135] His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup. He was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.[136] After his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a \\"lack of respect\\".[137] He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough.[138] O'Neal also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[139] He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics,[140] and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster,[141] he eventually declined the invitation.[142] Player profile O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses. O'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game. At 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg)[143] and U.S. shoe size 23,[65] he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.[144] O'Neal's \\"drop step\\", (called the \\"Black Tornado\\" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.[145] He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.[65] Opposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146] O'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \\"Hack-a-Shaq\\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150] O'Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage). O'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.[151] Phil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career, saying he \\"could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.\\"[152] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary The Athletic ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O'Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.[153] The Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2, 2013.[154] On February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams.[155][156] The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers. On January 4, 2024, the Orlando Magic announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey on February 13. O'Neal would become the second player after Wilt Chamberlain to have his jersey numbers retired by three different teams.[157] Off the court Media personality O'Neal in 1998 O'Neal called himself \\"The Big Aristotle\\" and \\"Hobo Master\\" for his composure and insights during interviews. Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames, including \\"Shaq\\", \\"The Diesel\\", \\"Shaq Fu\\", \\"The Big Daddy\\", \\"Superman\\", \\"The Big Agave\\", \\"The Big Cactus\\", \\"The Big Shaqtus\\", \\"The Big Galactus\\", \\"Wilt Chamberneezy\\", \\"The Big Baryshnikov\\", \\"The Real Deal\\", \\"The Big Shamrock\\", \\"The Big Leprechaun\\", \\"Shaqovic\\",[158][159] and \\"The Big Conductor\\".[160] Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.[161] When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.[161][162] During the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.[163][164] O'Neal's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers' long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; O'Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the \\"Queens\\".[165][166][167] During the 2002 victory parade, O'Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California,[168] after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven-game series en route to its third championship with O'Neal. He also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, \\"you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so.\\"[169] O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn't see the humor.[170] Yao joked, \\"Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.\\"[171] O'Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.[172] During the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier,[173] a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.[174] O'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, \\"I'm sorry, who?\\" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.[175] O'Neal also appeared on television on Saturday Night Live (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted Shaq's Big Challenge, a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape. When the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called \\"Bryant–O'Neal feud\\" that had festered since O'Neal left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant.[176] On June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant for not being able to win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times \\"Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes\\".[177] O'Neal justified his act by saying \\"I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.\\"[178] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal,[179] Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to \\"use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language\\". The racial quote from his song was \\"it's like a white boy trying to be more nigga than me.\\"[180] Music career Shaquille O'Neal + DIESEL (DJ) DIESEL DJing at the 2018 All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game DIESEL DJing at the 2018 All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game Background information Genres Hip hop, electronic dance music Occupation(s) Rapper, DJ Years active 1993–2001; 2017–present Labels Jive, Interscope, A&M, Trauma, Monstercat Beginning in 1993, O'Neal began to compose rap music. He released five studio albums and 1 compilation album. Although his rapping abilities were criticized at the outset,[181][182] one critic credited him with \\"progressing as a rapper in small steps, not leaps and bounds\\".[183] His 1993 debut album, Shaq Diesel, received platinum certification from the RIAA. O'Neal was featured alongside Michael Jackson as a guest rapper on \\"2 Bad\\", a song from Jackson's 1995 album HIStory. He contributed three tracks, including the song \\"We Genie\\", to the Kazaam soundtrack.[184] O'Neal was also featured in Aaron Carter's 2001 hit single \\"That's How I Beat Shaq\\". Shaq also appears in the music video for the release.[185] Shaquille O'Neal conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra at the Boston Symphony Hall on December 20, 2010. O'Neal also started DJing in the 1980s at LSU.[186] As DJ Diesel Currently, O'Neal produces electronic dance music and tours the world under the stage name DJ Diesel.[187] In July 2017, O'Neal released a diss track aimed at LaVar Ball, the father of NBA point guard Lonzo Ball. The three-minute song was released in response to Ball claiming him and his younger son LaMelo, would beat O'Neal and his son Shareef in a game of basketball. On October 23, 2021, O'Neal performed as DJ Diesel on the bassPOD stage at the 2021 Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, Nevada.[188][189][190] On June 7, 2023, O'Neal released his first single as DJ Diesel from his debut album Gorilla Warfare, titled \\"Bang Your Head\\" in collaboration with Hairitage.[191] The album was released on August 18.[192] Education O'Neal left LSU for the NBA after three years. However, he promised his mother he would eventually return to his studies and complete his bachelor's degree. He fulfilled that promise in 2000, earning his B.A. degree in general studies from LSU,[193] with a minor in political science.[194] Coach Phil Jackson let O'Neal miss a home game so he could attend graduation.

With sincere gratitude and admiration, Cameron McCaffrey Volunteer, Boca Raton Achievement Center Use the following information as a point of reference: Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name The Rock, is an American actor, businessman, and professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time,[5][6] he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for the WWF for eight years before pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over 3.5 billion in North America and over 10.5 billion worldwide,[7] making him one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.[8][9][10] He is a co-owner of the United Football League, a professional American football league.[11][12][13] He is also a member of the board of directors of TKO Group Holdings, the parent company of UFC and WWE.[14][15][16] After accepting an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Miami, he was a member of the 1991 national championship team but was largely a backup player.[17] Despite aspirations to professional football, he went undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft, and briefly signed with the Calgary Stampeders before being cut in his first season.[18] In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF.[2] Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left the WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances.[19] A 10-time world champion, including the promotion's first of African-American descent,[20] he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (Raw and SmackDown).[21][22] Johnson's first film role was in The Mummy Returns (2001). The next year, he played his first leading role in the action fantasy film The Scorpion King. He has since starred in family films The Game Plan (2007), Race to Witch Mountain (2009), Tooth Fairy (2010), Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017), Jumanji: The Next Level (2019), and Jungle Cruise (2021), and the action films Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013), Hercules (2014), Skyscraper (2018), San Andreas (2015) and Rampage (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films Get Smart (2008), Central Intelligence (2016), Baywatch (2017), and Red Notice (2021). His role as Luke Hobbs in the Fast & Furious films, beginning with Fast Five (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest-grossing in film.[23] He joined the DC Extended Universe playing the title role in Black Adam (2022).[24] He is also known for voicing Maui in the Disney animated film Moana (2016) and is set to reprise the role in the upcoming live action remake.[25] Johnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series Ballers (2015–2019)[26] and the autobiographical sitcom Young Rock (2021). His autobiography, The Rock Says, was released in 2000 and was a New York Times bestseller.[27][28] In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company Seven Bucks Productions.[29] In 2016 and 2019, Time named Johnson as one of the world's most influential people.[30][31] Early life As a senior at Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania, Johnson was a member of the school's football, track and field, and wrestling teams when, he says, his \\"thought process started to change. That's when I started thinking about goals and what I wanted to accomplish.\\" Johnson was born in Hayward, California,[32][33] on May 2, 1972,[34] the son of Mataniufeagaimaleata \\"Ata\\" Fitisemanu (née Maivia)[35][36] and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles).[37][38] Growing up, he briefly lived in Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand, with his mother's family,[39] where he played rugby[40] and attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S.[39] Johnson's father was a Black Nova Scotian with a small amount of Irish ancestry.[41][42] His mother is Samoan. His father and Tony Atlas were the first black tag team champions in WWE history, in 1983.[43][44] His mother is the adopted daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a professional wrestler.[45] Johnson's maternal grandmother Lia was one of the first female pro wrestling promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982 and managing it until 1988.[46][47] Through his maternal grandfather Maivia, Johnson is a non-blood relative of the Anoaʻi wrestling family.[48][49][50][51][52] In 2008, he inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.[53] Johnson attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina, and then moved to Hamden, Connecticut, where he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and then Hamden Middle School.[54][55] He attended President William McKinley High School in Honolulu and then Glencliff High School and McGavock High School, both in Nashville, Tennessee, and then Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley region of the state, where he graduated in 1990.[56] At Freedom High School, Johnson initially struggled and was drawn into a culture of conflict and petty crime. By age 17, he had been arrested several times for fighting, theft, and check fraud, and was suspended two weeks for fighting.[57] An article in the local newspaper labeled him \\"a troubled teenager with a history of run-ins with police.\\" But Freedom High School football coach Jody Cwik saw athletic potential in Johnson, and recruited him to join the school's football team, where he played defensive tackle, an experience that proved to be a significant personal transformation for Johnson. \\"My thought process started to change. That's when I started thinking about goals and what I wanted to accomplish\\", he has since said about his high school football experience.[17] In addition to playing football, Johnson also was a member of Freedom High School's track and field and wrestling teams.[37] By his senior year at Freedom High School, Johnson had played only two years of football, but was offered a full athletic scholarship offer from the University of Miami, whose football program was beginning to emerge as one of the nation's top-level NCAA Division 1 teams.[17] Football career College career Dwayne Johnson No. 94 Position Defensive tackle Major Criminology and physiology Personal information Born: May 2, 1972 (age 51) Hayward, California, U.S. Height 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) Weight 253 lb (115 kg) Career history College Miami (FL) (1990–1994) Bowl games Cotton Bowl Classic (1991) Orange Bowl (1992) High school Freedom High School (Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) Career highlights and awards AP Poll national champion (1991) As he did in high school, Johnson continued to play defensive tackle at the University of Miami, where he was a member of the Miami Hurricanes 1991 team, which won that year's national championship.[58][37] Despite playing four years there, however, Johnson found himself behind elite players on the depth chart, including future NFL star and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp, and appeared mostly in backup roles.[59][60] In his time at Miami, Johnson played in 39 games with one start. He recorded 4.5 sacks and 77 tackles.[61] In 1995, Johnson graduated with a Bachelor of General Studies and a dual major in criminology and physiology.[62] He was also one of the university's most prolific student speakers in the Miami-area community, frequently delivering positive messages about his own struggles and encouraging students to remain in school and avoid the dangers of drug use.[63] Canadian Football League After graduating, Johnson was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Calgary moved him from defensive tackle to linebacker. He was assigned to Calgary's practice roster, but was cut two months into Calgary's 1995 season.[37][64][65] Professional wrestling career Early career (1996) Part of a series on Professional wrestling History Notable promotions Notable people By region Styles Concepts Media Controversies Lists Related topics vte After being cut by Calgary, Johnson began his professional wrestling career the next year, in 1996.[37] Veteran wrestler Pat Patterson secured several tryout matches for Johnson with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996. Wrestling at first under his real name, Johnson defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show on March 10[66] and lost matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart.[39] After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association under the name Flex Kavana and winning the USWA tag team championship twice with his partner Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson was signed to a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.[4][39] World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment Intercontinental Champion (1996–1997) Johnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring names, although announcers acknowledged his real name.[67] He was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross.[47][68] He was given the nickname \\"The Blue Chipper\\", and to play up his lineage, he was hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler.[3] A clean-cut face character, Maivia was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. He debuted on Monday Night Raw as a member of Marc Mero's entourage on November 4, 1996.[69] His first match came at Survivor Series on November 17, 1996, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, Crush and Goldust.[70] On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on Monday Night Raw.[71][72][73] Maivia then successfully defended the title against Helmsley at In Your House 13: Final Four. Johnson's first WrestleMania match came at WrestleMania 13 on March 23, 1997, where he was victorious in his Intercontinental Championship defense against The Sultan. WWF fans started to reject his character and push from the company.[74] He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on the March 31 episode of Raw is War.[75] Behind the scenes, Hart mentored Johnson for his first year in WWF[76] and refused to be booked to take the title from him.[77] On April 20, at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout but retained the title. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of \\"die, Rocky, die\\" and \\"Rocky sucks\\" being heard during his matches.[2][47] After losing the Intercontinental Championship to Owen Hart on the April 28, 1997, episode of Raw Is War,[78] Maivia suffered a legitimate knee injury in a match against Mankind in June 1997 and spent several months recovering.[2] Nation of Domination (1997–1998) See also: Nation of Domination Upon returning in August 1997, Maivia turned heel for the first time in his career by lashing out at fans who had been booing him and joining Faarooq, D'Lo Brown and Kama in the stable called the Nation of Domination.[79] He then refused to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as the Rock, though he would still be billed as \\"The Rock\\" Rocky Maivia until 1998. The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his promos.[79] At D-Generation X: In Your House on December 7, 1997, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Rock in under six minutes to retain the Intercontinental Championship.[80] The next night on Raw Is War, Austin was ordered by Mr. McMahon to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to the Rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the Stone Cold Stunner.[81][82] The Rock feuded with Austin and Ken Shamrock through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998.[83][84] On January 19, 1998, at the Royal Rumble, the Rock defeated Shamrock by disqualification to retain the Intercontinental title. Later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final two before he was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. On March 29, at WrestleMania XIV, he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on Raw is War, the Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at Over the Edge: In Your House on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply \\"The Nation\\".[85] The Rock and the Nation then feuded with Triple H and D-Generation X, with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the 1998 King of the Ring tournament, which the Rock won. At King of the Ring, the Rock defeated Dan Severn in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a two out of three falls match at Fully Loaded: In Your House for the Intercontinental title, which the Rock retained in controversial fashion.[86] This led to a ladder match at SummerSlam on August 30, 1998, where the Rock lost the title.[87] In the latter half of 1998, The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support. He also started consolidating his famous persona during this time, which would last until 2000.[88] His popularity caused him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown, turning babyface in the process. Henry defeated him at Judgment Day: In Your House on October 18, 1998, after interference from Brown, effectively breaking up the stable.[89][90] WWF Champion and rise to superstardom (1998–2000) See also: The Corporation and Rock 'n' Sock Connection As part of The Corporation, the Rock feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin and stole Austin's personalized WWF Championship and his \\"Smoking Skull\\" belt. The Rock was then entered into the \\"Deadly Game\\" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The finals occurred at Survivor Series on November 15, 1998, where the Rock defeated Vince McMahon's associate, Mankind, to win his first WWF Championship.[91][92] A \\"double turn\\" then occurred as the Rock turned heel again after allying with Vince and Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of their stable, The Corporation, after the McMahons betrayed Mankind.[91][93] On December 13, 1998, at the pay-per-view named after him, Rock Bottom: In Your House, the Rock had a rematch with Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind appeared to win the match when the Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw submission move, but Vince McMahon ruled that since the Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.[93][94] In the main event of the January 4, 1999, episode of Raw Is War, Mankind defeated the Rock for the championship after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.[95] Then at the Royal Rumble on January 24, 1999, the Rock regained the title in an \\"I Quit\\" match, a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says \\"I quit\\" on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious streak in the Rock's character, the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being risky (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the fifth shot, Mankind was still ringside instead of two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot, which knocked Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying \\"I Quit\\" from an earlier interview was played over the public address system.[96][97] On January 31, during an episode of Sunday Night Heat, the Rock and Mankind participated in an Empty Arena match, a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. After 20 minutes of chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, Mankind pinned the Rock using a forklift truck to win the WWF title.[98] The two faced off again, at St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House on February 14, 1999, in a Last Man Standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title. Their feud ended on the February 15 Raw Is War, when the Rock won his third WWF Championship in a Ladder Match after a debuting Big Show interfered on his behalf.[99][100] The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XV on March 28, 1999.[101] The Rock's popularity was fueled by his charisma and speaking abilities, which led to many catchphrases and merchandising opportunities. The Rock's popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered for him even though he was a heel. He then lost the title rematch against Stone Cold Steve Austin at Backlash: In Your House on April 25, 1999.[102] The next night on Raw is War he was fired from the Corporation after he was betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him face again and starting a feud with Triple H, The Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry. On April 29, 1999, WWF aired the pilot episode of SmackDown!, a term derived from one of the Rock's catchphrases. In the episode, the Rock continued his feud with The Corporate Ministry. This led to a match with Triple H, at Over the Edge on May 23, 1999, which the Rock won,[103] and a match for the WWF Championship against The Undertaker, at King of the Ring, which the Rock lost.[104] The Rock then lost a number one contender's match to Triple H, at Fully Loaded, after interference from \\"Mr. Ass\\" Billy Gunn.[105] The Rock then defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass match at SummerSlam on August 22, 1999. The Rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like The Undertaker with the Buried Alive match, Kane with the Inferno Match and Mankind with the Boiler Room Brawl: the Brahma Bullrope match, a variant of a strap match was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as weapons. The Rock contested this match twice, both times in Texas (vs Triple H in Dallas, and vs Al Snow in Houston).[106] Shortly after SummerSlam, the Rock began teaming with former opponent Mankind and the two became known as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection.[107] They became WWF Tag Team Champions for the first time after defeating The Undertaker and Big Show for the titles on the August 30, 1999, episode of Raw is War.[108][109] The two performed a number of critically acclaimed comedic skits together, including one called \\"This Is Your Life\\", which saw Mankind bring parody versions of people from the Rock's past on television, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach, only to have the Rock insult them. The segment earned an 8.4 Nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a Raw segment.[110] The two lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show on the September 9 episode of SmackDown! and won them back from them on the September 20 episode of Raw is War.[111][112] Rock and Mankind then lost the titles to The New Age Outlaws on the very next episode of SmackDown!.[113] Rock and Mankind would win the tag titles for the third and final time after beating the New Age Outlaws on the October 14 episode of SmackDown! before losing the titles to The Holly Cousins on the October 18 episode of Raw is War.[114][115] At the Royal Rumble, on January 23, 2000, the Rock entered the Royal Rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show. In an attempt at a \\"false finish\\", Big Show intended to throw the Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, before the Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before reentering the ring as the winner.[116] But the Rock's feet accidentally hit the floor during the reversal attempt, though those watching the event on television did not see that. This was played up in the storyline as Big Show provided additional video footage showing it and claimed to be the rightful winner. The Rock's number one contendership for the WWF Championship was then put on the line against Big Show at No Way Out on February 27, 2000, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered.[117] The Rock then defeated Big Show on the March 13 episode of Raw Is War, to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, in a Fatal Four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley.[118][119] Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife Stephanie, Foley had Linda, the Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane.[119][120] The Rock lasted until the final two but was eliminated by Triple H after Vince betrayed him by hitting him with a chair.[120][121] Due to his image at the time, a Magic: The Gathering deck archetype was named after him.[122] Record-breaking world champion (2000–2002) The Rock as the WWF Champion in 2000 In the following weeks, the Rock continued his feud with Triple H and eventually won his fourth WWF Championship, which he won on April 30, at Backlash, after Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened on his behalf.[123][124] The following night on Raw, he successfully defended his title against Shane McMahon in a Steel Cage match. On May 21, at Judgment Day, the Rock faced Triple H in an Iron Man match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee.[125] With the score tied at five falls each, and with seconds left on the time limit, the Rock was disqualified when The Undertaker attacked Triple H, thus giving Triple H the 6–5 win and the title.[125][126] The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned.[127][128] The Rock successfully defended the championship against Chris Benoit, on July 23, at Fully Loaded. The next month, he successfully defended his title against Kurt Angle and Triple H at SummerSlam. The Rock had another successful title defense against Benoit, Kane and The Undertaker, on September 24, at Unforgiven.[129] The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Kurt Angle, at No Mercy, on October 22, 2000.[130] The next month, the Rock feuded with Rikishi and defeated him at Survivor Series.[131] The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship, at Armageddon, which Angle won to retain the title.[132] On the December 18 episode of Raw, the Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, before losing it back to them the next night at a SmackDown! taping.[133] In 2001, the Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out on February 25, 2001, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time.[134][135] The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title to at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Vince McMahon, who interfered on his behalf.[136] On the next night's Raw Is War, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H attacked the Rock, allying with McMahon and Austin and helping Austin retain the championship.[137] Austin and Triple H then formed a tag team called The Power Trip,[138] while the Rock was indefinitely suspended in storyline. Johnson used this time off to act in The Scorpion King. The Rock taunting an opponent at ringside at WWF Raw, October 2001 The Rock returned in late July 2001 when the WWF was feuding with rival promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) during what is known as The Invasion storyline. In reality, WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon and the WWF, and ECW had gone out of business in early 2001. Many former WCW and ECW wrestlers were then brought onto WWF television and formed The Alliance to compete with WWF in storyline. The Alliance and Vince McMahon then both attempted to persuade the Rock to join their team. The Rock then aligned with McMahon and the WWF. The next month, the Rock defeated Booker T, at SummerSlam, to win the WCW Championship for the first time.[139][140] He later lost the title to Chris Jericho at No Mercy on October 21, 2001.[141][142] The next night on Raw, he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Dudley Boyz. The two then lost the tag titles to Booker T and Test on the November 1, 2001, episode of SmackDown!.[143] The Rock defeated Jericho on the November 5 episode of Raw for his second WCW Championship.[144] As part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a \\"winner takes all\\" five-on-five elimination tag team match at Survivor Series where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance's team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded \\"World Championship\\" following the Alliance's loss.[145] At the next pay-per-view, Vengeance on December 9, 2001, the Rock lost the World Championship to Jericho, who would then unify the WWF and World titles later that night.[146] The Rock then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the now Undisputed WWF Championship at Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002.[147] The Rock doing his signature pose before wrestling Hulk Hogan (bottom right) at WrestleMania X8, March 2002 At the next pay-per-view, No Way Out on February 17, 2002, the Rock defeated The Undertaker in a singles match. The event also saw the WWF debut of the famed WCW faction New World Order, which at the time consisted of \\"Hollywood\\" Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall.[148] This later led to a match between the Rock and Hogan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002. The match was billed as \\"icon versus icon\\", with both men representing the top tier of two generations of wrestling; ultimately the Rock pinned Hogan at WrestleMania X8 to win the match.[149] Despite the Rock portraying a heroic character and Hogan a villain, a portion of the crowd attending the SkyDome was rooting heavily for Hogan.[150][151] In an interview in 2013, Hogan said he and the Rock changed the style of the match on the fly based on the crowd's response.[152] After the introduction of the first-ever brand extension, the WWF held a \\"draft lottery\\" on the March 25, 2002, episode of Raw. The Rock was the number one overall pick, going to the SmackDown! brand before taking a sabbatical from wrestling.[153] The Rock made a surprise return on a June episode of Raw before going to his assigned brand of SmackDown!. There, he was named the number one contender for the WWE Undisputed Championship, which he won for a record-setting seventh time at Vengeance, on July 21, by defeating Kurt Angle and then-champion The Undertaker in a Triple Threat match.[154][155] The Rock successfully defended the title at the Global Warning event against Triple H and Brock Lesnar after pinning Triple H.[156] On August 25, at SummerSlam, after interference from Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman, the Rock lost the WWE Undisputed Championship to Lesnar along with the record for the youngest WWE Champion, which he had set in 1998.[157] In 2018, writing for ESPN.com, Sean Coyle noted in a retrospective review of the event, that following his victory over Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8, the Rock \\"started to see a dip in fan support\\" and \\"that dip turned into a plunge\\" by the time Rock had his match with Lesnar at SummerSlam because fans knew he was leaving WWE to pursue an acting career,[158] as evidenced by the negative crowd response during his match with Lesnar.[159] After SummerSlam ended, the Rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. When he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans booed him.[160] The Rock then took time off to kickstart his acting career.[161] Final feuds and departure (2003–2004) The Rock defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin (left) in Austin's final match at WrestleMania XIX in March 2003. The Rock returned on the January 30, 2003, episode of SmackDown! to set up another match with Hulk Hogan at No Way Out.[162] Because of negative fan reaction during previous matches as a result of his budding acting career, The Rock turned heel for the first time since 1999. He also started a new persona that has been called Hollywood Rock, with a new look and a shaved head.[163][164] The Rock defeated Hogan at No Way Out before moving to the Raw brand.[165] There, he had various small feuds, including one with The Hurricane.[166] He also began performing \\"Rock Concerts\\", segments in which he played the guitar and mocked WWE performers and fans in song.[167] After failing to win a number one contendership for the World Heavyweight Championship, The Rock went into another program with Stone Cold Steve Austin. This led to a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, 2003, which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won.[168] The Rock won after delivering three consecutive Rock Bottoms, ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be Austin's final match.[2][169] The next night, Raw was billed as \\"The Rock Appreciation Night\\", in honor of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting Goldberg.[170] At Backlash on April 27, 2003, Goldberg defeated The Rock, who then briefly left WWE to film Walking Tall.[2][171] During the rest of the year, The Rock made occasional appearances, returning to a face character.[172] In 2004, The Rock aided Mick Foley in his feud against Evolution,[3][2][173] leading to a reunion of the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. They lost against Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista in a handicap match at WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004, when Orton pinned Foley after an RKO.[2][174] This was Johnson's final wrestling match until November 2011. The Rock appeared in WWE sporadically following WrestleMania XX. He made returns to provide support for Eugene against Jonathan Coachman, and made a cameo in his hometown of Miami and helped Mick Foley against La Résistance.[2] Later in 2004, he hosted a pie-eating contest, as part of the WWE Diva Search, and ended the segment by giving Coachman a People's Elbow.[2] The Rock's contract with WWE then ended and he started his full-time acting career.[175] Non-wrestling appearances (2007–2009) On March 12, 2007, the Rock appeared on a WWE show after nearly three years, via a pre-taped promo shown during Raw. He correctly predicted that Bobby Lashley would defeat Umaga at WrestleMania 23 in Donald Trump's and Vince McMahon's \\"Battle of the Billionaires\\" Hair vs. Hair match.[176] On March 29, 2008, Johnson inducted his father Rocky Johnson and grandfather Peter Maivia into the WWE Hall of Fame.[177] His next appearance was through a pre-taped promo on October 2, 2009, during the Decade of SmackDown.[178] Independent circuit (2009) On September 30, 2009, the Rock appeared at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show to support the professional wrestling debut of Sarona Snuka, the daughter of his longtime friend and mentor Jimmy Snuka.[179] Return to WWE Feud with John Cena (2011–2013) The Rock in the ring as WrestleMania XXVII host, April 2011 On February 14, 2011, the Rock was announced as the host of WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, 2011, appearing live on Raw for the first time in almost seven years. During a lengthy promo, he addressed the fans and started a feud with John Cena.[180][181] After numerous appearances via satellite, the Rock appeared live on the Raw before WrestleMania XXVII to confront Cena. After he and Cena exchanged insults, The Miz and Alex Riley appeared and attacked the Rock; he fended off Miz and Riley, only for Cena to blindside him with an Attitude Adjustment.[182] The Rock and John Cena (left) on Raw, agreeing to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII one year in advance On April 3, at WrestleMania XXVII, the Rock opened the show by cutting a promo. After appearing in numerous backstage segments, the Rock came to ringside to restart the main event between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match, after it had ended in a draw. As revenge for the Attitude Adjustment Cena had given him on Raw, Rock hit Cena with the Rock Bottom, allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the People's Elbow.[183] The next night on Raw, the Rock and Cena agreed to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year. They then worked together to fend off an attack by The Corre, which at the time consisted of Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, and Ezekiel Jackson.[184] The Rock appeared live on Raw in his hometown of Miami to celebrate his 39th birthday.[185] On September 16, WWE announced the Rock would wrestle in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series tag team match, teaming with Cena at Survivor Series in November.[186] But on the October 24 episode of Raw, Cena instead suggested the Rock be his partner in a standard tag team match against The Miz and R-Truth, a team called Awesome Truth,[187] which Rock agreed to the next week.[188] On November 14, during the special Raw Gets Rocked, the Rock appeared live, delivering Rock Bottoms to Mick Foley, who had been hosting a \\"This Is Your Life\\"-style segment for Cena, and later both members of Awesome Truth.[189] The Rock and Cena defeated Awesome Truth on November 20 at Survivor Series, when the Rock pinned The Miz. After the match, the Rock gave Cena a Rock Bottom.[190] The Rock celebrating his victory at WrestleMania XXVIII, April 2012 Leading up to WrestleMania, the Rock and Cena had several verbal confrontations on Raw.[191][192] On the March 12, 2012, episode of Raw, the Rock hosted his first \\"Rock Concert\\" segment since 2004, mocking Cena in his songs.[193] On April 1, at WrestleMania XXVIII, the Rock defeated Cena in the main event after countering Cena's attempt at a People's Elbow into a Rock Bottom and pinning Cena.[194] This event broke the record for biggest professional wrestling pay-per-view buyrate. The following night on Raw, the Rock praised Cena, calling their match \\"an honor\\". He then vowed to once again become WWE Champion.[195] On July 23, at Raw 1000, the Rock announced he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. During the show, he encountered then-reigning WWE Champion CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and John Cena, all of whom expressed a desire to face him. The Rock later saved Cena from an assault by Big Show, only to be laid out by CM Punk.[196] On the January 7, 2013, episode of Raw, the Rock returned to confront his Royal Rumble opponent CM Punk.[197] On January 11, he made his first SmackDown appearance in ten years, getting into an altercation with Team Rhodes Scholars, resulting in him delivering a Rock Bottom to Damien Sandow and a People's Elbow to Cody Rhodes.[198] The Rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of Raw, on January 14, with one of his \\"Rock Concerts\\", leading to a brawl with CM Punk.[199] The following week on Raw, the Rock was attacked by The Shield. Vince McMahon then asserted that if The Shield attacked the Rock in his title match with CM Punk, Punk would be stripped of the WWE Championship.[200] The Rock revealing the brand new WWE Championship design on WWE Raw, February 2013 On January 27, at the Royal Rumble, CM Punk would seemingly defeat the Rock after the arena lights went out and someone attacked the Rock. Vince McMahon then came out and was about to strip Punk of the championship, however, at the Rock's request, he instead restarted the match. This culminated in the Rock defeating Punk to win his eighth WWE Championship.[201] Punk received a title rematch with the Rock, at Elimination Chamber on February 17, 2013, with the added stipulation that if the Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would still lose the WWE Championship. The Rock would pin Punk to defeat him and retain the championship.[202] The following night on Raw, the Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship design, with a different center plate and removable customizable side-plates which had his \\"Brahma Bull\\" logo.[203] The Rock then resumed his rivalry with John Cena, who won that year's Royal Rumble to set up a rematch of the previous WrestleMania match between the two at WrestleMania 29, only this time with the WWE Championship on the line.[204][205] On April 7, at WrestleMania 29, Rock lost the WWE Championship to Cena, ending his reign at 70 days.[206] Despite being advertised for Raw after WrestleMania, where it was stated that the Rock was still entitled a rematch for the WWE Championship,[207] The Rock did not appear because of a real injury sustained during his match with Cena, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis.[208] Johnson underwent surgery on April 23 to reattach the torn tendons.[209] Part-time appearances and final match (2014–2016) The Rock (right) confronts Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania XXX, April 2014. The Wyatt Family confronting The Rock at WrestleMania 32, April 2016 In April 2014, the Rock appeared in the opening segment of WrestleMania XXX along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan.[210] On the October 6 episode of Raw, the Rock made a surprise appearance to confront Rusev and Lana; this resulted in the Rock clearing Rusev from the ring.[211] The Rock appeared at the 2015 Royal Rumble event on January 25, 2015, during the main event match, where he helped his relative Roman Reigns fend off Big Show and Kane after Reigns eliminated them from the match. Reigns then won the match and the Rock endorsed him in the ring.[212][213][214] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, alongside Ronda Rousey, getting into an in-ring altercation with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Rock and Rousey prevailed after he attacked Triple H and she overpowered McMahon.[215] On June 27, the Rock appeared at a live event in Boston, where he confronted Bo Dallas and gave him a Rock Bottom.[216] On the January 25, 2016, episode of Raw, the Rock was in a segment that saw him converse with The Miz, Big Show, Lana and Rusev before he and his relatives, The Usos, got into an altercation with then-WWE Tag Team Champions, The New Day.[217] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, where he announced that WWE had broken the all-time WrestleMania attendance record before being interrupted by The Wyatt Family. The Rock got into a verbal back-and-forth with Bray Wyatt before having an impromptu match with Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan. The Rock won after giving Rowan a Rock Bottom and pinning him in six seconds, which set the record for the fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by a returning John Cena to fend off Wyatt, Rowan and Braun Strowman.[218] Sporadic appearances (2017–present) On the February 20, 2017, episode of Raw, the Rock made an untelevised appearance after the broadcast had gone off the air, where he promoted and filmed a scene for his then-upcoming film Fighting with My Family.[219] On August 3, 2019, the Rock officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling.[220] On September 30, 2019, after weeks of speculation, the Rock announced that he would appear on SmackDown's 20th Anniversary on October 4, 2019, marking his first appearance on SmackDown since October 2014 and his first televised appearance since April 2016.[221] At the event, he cut a promo with Becky Lynch before they were interrupted by King Corbin. After attacking Corbin, the Rock and Lynch celebrated in the ring.[222] On September 15, 2023, the Rock made a surprise return to SmackDown, in a segment with Pat McAfee and Austin Theory, who Rock took out within the segment. This marked his first televised appearance in WWE since October 4, 2019.[223] On December 30, it was teased by Triple H that a former WWE Champion would be appearing on the Day 1 edition of “Raw” on January 1, 2024. The unidentified champion was revealed to be The Rock, marking his first televised appearance on Raw since 2016. The Rock was featured on a segment with Jinder Mahal, and asked fans if he should sit at “the head of the table”, a direct shot at his cousin Roman Reigns.[224] On February 2, 2024, the Rock made a return to SmackDown, where he confronted Reigns.[225] The next day, WWE's Twitter page announced that the Rock would be at the WrestleMania XL Press Event to go face to face with Reigns again. Mainstream crossover The Rock in a 2001 Vanity Fair photo shoot The Rock appeared on Wyclef Jean's 2000 single \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" and in its music video.[226][227] He also recorded \\"Pie\\" with Slick Rick for WWF The Music, Vol. 5.[228] In 1999, Johnson appeared on That '70s Show as his father Rocky Johnson. The next year, he was on Star Trek: Voyager as an alien wrestler who used the Rock's moves.[229] In 2000, he hosted Saturday Night Live (SNL) for the first time.[230] Fellow wrestlers Triple H, Big Show, and Mick Foley also appeared on the show.[3][231] Johnson has said the success of that episode is the reason he began receiving offers from Hollywood studios.[232] He has since hosted SNL four more times. In 1999, the Rock was listed No. 5 on Entertainment Weekly's Top 12 Entertainers of the Year.[233] In 2000, Access Hollywood ranked him number six in their list of the Top 10 Celebrities of 2000.[234] That year, Rock was also listed in the Forbes Celebrity 100 and People Magazine's 25 Most Intriguing People.[235][236] The Rock was listed on Entertainment Weekly's 101 Most Influential People in both 2000 and 2001.[237] In 2001, he was also listed on E!'s 20 Top Entertainers.[238][239] In 2002, the Rock was listed on E!'s 25 Toughest Stars.[240] In 2003, he was listed in VH1's 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons[241] and was No. 13 in People Magazine's 50 Favorite TV Stars.[242] The Rock made a surprise appearance at the official Xbox unveiling during Bill Gates's keynote speech at the ongoing Computer Electronics Show in 2001.[243] Johnson's motion picture debut was as The Scorpion King in The Mummy Returns (2001).[244] The movie broke a two-year record for the highest-grossing single day in film history by earning 28,594,667.[245][3][230] The movie's financial success led to Johnson's first leading role in the spin-off The Scorpion King (2002).[3] He received 5.5 million for the role and Guinness World Records named him the record-holder for highest-paid actor in their first leading role.[246][247] The Rock has appeared on the covers of many magazines, including Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, and TV Guide.[248][249][250] He has also appeared in, and been the cover athlete for, several video games.[251] As of November 2021, his Instagram account is the fourth most-followed in the world, with over 280 million followers.[252] Legacy and career assessment This article possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (October 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Rock has been listed as one of the all-time greatest professional wrestlers,[20][5][6] as well as one of the top draws in wrestling history. Many have placed the Rock on their \\"Mount Rushmore of Pro Wrestling\\", including Hulk Hogan,[253] Ric Flair,[254] and John Cena.[255] In Cable Visions: Television Beyond Broadcasting, the Rock was described as \\"for a long time, the WWE's biggest star and probably held the greatest international appeal\\".[256] R. D. Reynolds stated in his book The WrestleCrap Book of Lists that the Rock was \\"the biggest star for WWE from 1999 until 2004\\".[257] The Rock's \\"I quit\\" match with Mankind at the 1999 Royal Rumble event is infamous for its brutality and one of the most popular \\"I quit\\" match of all times.[258][259][260][261] The Rock main-evented the most bought pay-per-view worldwide in WWE history (WrestleMania XXVIII),[262] the most bought pay-per-view domestically in WWE history (WrestleMania X-Seven), the highest rated Raw in history,[263][264] the highest rated SmackDown in history,[265] and was part of the highest rated cable segment in WWE history with Mankind entitled \\"This is Your Life\\", in which Mankind would honor The Rock with various gifts and reunions.[266][267] His return in 2001 had a 7.1 rating, the highest-rated segment of the year. The Rock was also part of the highest-rated match of the 21st century when his WWF Championship defense against Shane McMahon, on May 1, 2000, got an 8.3 rating, making it the highest-rated segment of all time, behind \\"This Is Your Life\\". In 2011, the Rock's return to an episode of Raw generated an average of 4.7 million viewers in the United States, with 7.4 million tuning in during his promo.[268] Raw 1000 was the highest rated Raw episode of 2012 and his segment with CM Punk and Daniel Bryan was the highest rated segment of the show.[269] In 2013, the night after the Rock won the WWE Championship for the first time in over a decade, at Royal Rumble, Raw got its highest rating of that year.[270] Derived from one of his catchphrases \\"lay the smackdown\\", WWE introduced in 1999 its second flagship program, WWE SmackDown, which became television's second longest-running weekly episodic program in history.[271] The term \\"smackdown\\" was included in Merriam-Webster dictionaries in 2007.[272][273] He is also known for popularizing the term \\"jabroni\\", derived from \\"jobber\\", although it was originally introduced by The Iron Sheik.[274][275] The Rock holds the record for most Raw shows main-evented in one year (38 in 2000),[276] most SmackDown shows main-evented in one year (36 in 2000),[277] and is tied with Stone Cold Steve Austin (in 2001) for most PPV shows main evented in one year (12 in 2000).[278][279] At the 2021 Survivor Series, WWE held a 25-man Battle Royal to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the Rock's WWE debut. The match was won by Omos.[280] Acting career Johnson in April 2009 Career beginnings (2001–2010) Johnson entered Hollywood and the film industry, becoming a star initially through his wrestling popularity and noted work ethic. Over his acting career, he became one of the highest-paid and most successful actors in Hollywood.[281][282][283][284] He began his acting career on television while wrestling. In his first television acting job, in 1999, he played his father in an episode of That '70s Show called \\"That Wrestling Show\\". Nearly a year later, he appeared in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Tsunkatse\\" as an alien wrestler who fought popular character Seven of Nine. While Johnson was away from WWE, the company continued to sell \\"The Rock\\" merchandise, and he continued to be featured prominently in the opening montages of their television shows.[39] Johnson began his film career in earnest with roles in The Mummy Returns (2001), The Scorpion King (2002), The Rundown (2003), and Walking Tall (2004).

He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide and was named the Offensive MVP of the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship during his freshman season. Tagovailoa won the Maxwell and Walter Camp Awards as a sophomore. He is the brother of Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa. After his junior season was cut short by a hip injury, Tagovailoa was selected fifth overall by the Dolphins in the 2020 NFL Draft. He spent his rookie season alternating as a backup and starter before becoming the team's primary starter in 2021. He led the league in passer rating in 2022 and passing yards in 2023, earning Pro Bowl honors in the latter. Early years Tagovailoa[3] was born in ʻEwa Beach, Hawaii, to Galu and Diane Tagovailoa, as the oldest of four children in a Samoan family.[4][5] He was said to have grown up with an intense interest in football, with his parents noting that he slept with a football under his arm every night as a small child.[4] During Pop Warner games when he was eight years old, when his peers could typically throw a football little more than 10 yards, he routinely threw passes of more than 30 yards.[6] As a child, his main inspiration was his grandfather Seu Tagovailoa. He was highly respected in the local Samoan community and was regularly addressed as \\"Chief Tagovailoa\\". Seu believed that Tagovailoa would eventually grow into a football star and he requested that he visit him after every game to report his progress. Tagovailoa briefly considered quitting the sport after Seu's death in 2014 until he and his father agreed that he could best honor him by continuing to play.[6][7] When Tagovailoa began varsity football in high school, he threw for 33 passing touchdowns during his first season with three interceptions and 2,583 passing yards.[8] Tagovailoa said a big inspiration and motivation for his performance was how his father disciplined him, saying he used a belt whenever Tagovailoa threw an interception.[4] In 2016, Tagovailoa played in the All-American Bowl,[9] and in his regular season threw for 2,669 passing yards with 27 passing touchdowns and seven interceptions. He was also chosen to be a part of the Elite 11 roster as one of the top high school quarterbacks in the nation, where he was named MVP of that roster.[10] Tagovailoa was deemed a four-star recruit during the 2017 recruiting cycle and was ranked the top high school prospect in the state of Hawaii.[11] He attended Saint Louis School in Honolulu, the same school as 2014 Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota,[12] where Mariota served as a mentor to him when they were growing up in Hawaii.[13] He had 17 offers to play on a college football scholarship before eventually enrolling at the University of Alabama in January 2017.

On September 9, he made his collegiate debut against Fresno State in a home game at Bryant–Denny Stadium. In the 41–10 victory, he finished 6-of-9 for 64 yards and his first career passing touchdown, which was a 16-yard pass to wide receiver Henry Ruggs.[14] On September 23, in a 59–0 victory against Vanderbilt, he got more playing time and recorded 103 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[15] In the next game, against SEC West rival Ole Miss, he recorded his first collegiate rushing touchdown in a 66–3 victory.[16] In the annual rivalry game against Tennessee, he finished with 134 passing yards, one passing touchdown, one interception, and one rushing touchdown in the 45–7 victory.[17] On November 18, in a game against Mercer, he threw for three passing touchdowns in the 56–0 victory.[18] On January 8, 2018, he replaced Hurts in the second half of the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship due to ineffective play by Hurts.[19] He threw the game-winning 41-yard touchdown pass in overtime to another true freshman, wide receiver DeVonta Smith as Alabama defeated Georgia, 26–23, claiming their 17th National Championship.

He finished 12-of-16, with 227 passing yards and two touchdowns in the 51–14 victory, before Jalen Hurts replaced him in the third quarter.[23] During Alabama head coach Nick Saban's weekly Monday press conference following the victory, he announced Tagovailoa as the starter for the Crimson Tide's home opener against Arkansas State on September 8.[24] In the 62–7 victory over Ole Miss, he was 11-of-15 for 191 passing yards and two touchdowns to go along with 47 rushing yards.[25] He continued his efficient season against Texas A&M with 387 passing yards, four passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown in the 45–23 victory.[26] In a limited role against Louisiana, he was 8-of-8 passing for 128 passing yards and two passing touchdowns in the 56–14 victory.[27] In the next game against Arkansas, he had more passing touchdowns than incompletions as he went 10-of-13 for 334 passing yards and four passing touchdowns in the 65–31 victory.[28] Following the regular season, he finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting to Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray, but he won the Walter Camp Award and Maxwell Award for 2018, both awarded to the top player in college football.[29] While recovering from the high ankle sprain he suffered during the SEC Championship against Georgia, Tagovailoa put on a nearly flawless offensive performance against Oklahoma in the 2018 Orange Bowl (24-of-27 with 318 yards passing, four touchdowns and no interceptions) to lead the Tide to their fourth consecutive CFP National Championship appearance. He was also named Offensive MVP of that game.[30] In the 2019 National Championship, Tagovailoa went 22-of-34 with 295 passing yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions in a 44–16 loss to Clemson.[31] He also set a new NCAA FBS passer rating record of 199.4 for the season, surpassing the record 198.9 set by Baker Mayfield in 2017.[32] 2019 season Tagovailoa began his junior season at the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game with a victory against Duke in Atlanta. He finished 26-of-31 with 336 passing yards and four touchdowns before sitting out the fourth quarter.[33] The second game of the season was a home opener victory against New Mexico State. Tagovailoa finished that game 16-of-24 with 227 passing yards and four total touchdowns before sitting out the fourth quarter.[34] In his third game of the season, a victory against South Carolina, Tagovailoa finished 28-of-36 with 444 passing yards and five touchdowns.[35] In the Tide's 49–7 victory against Southern Miss, Tagovailoa finished 17-of-21 with 293 passing yards and five touchdowns.[36] In the Tide's fifth game, a victory against Ole Miss, Tagovailoa finished 26-of-36 with 418 passing yards and seven total touchdowns.[37] In the Tide's 47–28 victory against Texas A&M, Tagovailoa finished 21-of-34 with 293 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception.[38] Tagovailoa left the Tide's seventh game against Tennessee early in the second quarter after suffering a high ankle sprain.[39] He underwent surgery to repair the ankle the following day, and did not play in the next game against Arkansas (a 48–7 victory led by quarterback Mac Jones).[40][41] Tagovailoa returned three weeks post-surgery to play in the 46–41 loss to top-ranked LSU.[42] Despite some struggles (a fumble and INT) in the first half of that game, Tagovailoa rebounded after halftime to finish 21-of-40 with 413 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception.[43] In the Tide's matchup against Mississippi State, Tagovailoa led the team to a 35–7 lead (14-of-18, 256 passing yards, two touchdowns) before leaving the game after a sack that saw his knee driven into the ground, causing his hip to dislocate and fracturing the posterior wall, as well as suffering a broken nose and concussion.[44][45] He was carted off the field and flown to a Birmingham hospital before undergoing surgery in Houston two days later.[45] In January 2020, Tagovailoa announced that he would forgo his senior year and enter the 2020 NFL Draft.[46] Tagovailoa finished his collegiate career as holder of numerous Alabama football records, as well as notable NCAA career records, including: passing yards per attempt (10.9), adjusted passing yards per attempt (12.7), passing efficiency rating (199.4), and total yards per play (9.8).[47][48] He graduated with a bachelor's degree in communication studies in August 2020.[49] Statistics Alabama Crimson Tide Season Games Passing Rushing GP GS Record Cmp Att Pct Yds Avg TD Int Rtg Att Yds Avg TD 2017 8 0 — 49 77 63.6 636 8.3 11 2 175.0 27 133 4.9 2 2018 15 15 14−1 245 355 69.0 3,966 11.2 43 6 199.4 57 190 3.3 5 2019 9 9 8−1 180 252 71.4 2,840 11.3 33 3 206.9 23 17 0.7 2 Career 32 24 22−2 474 684 69.3 7,442 10.9 87 11 199.4 107 340 3.2 9 Professional career Pre-draft measurables Height Weight Arm length Hand span Wonderlic 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) 217 lb (98 kg) 30+1⁄2 in (0.77 m) 10 in (0.25 m) 13[50] All values from NFL Combine[51] Tagovailoa was projected to be taken first overall in the 2020 NFL Draft until his season-ending injury led to LSU quarterback and 2019 Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow supplanting him as the draft's top prospect.[52][53][54] Despite injury concerns, however, Tagovailoa was selected fifth overall by the Miami Dolphins.[55] Tagovailoa was also the first left-handed quarterback to be drafted by an NFL team since Tim Tebow in 2010.[56] Because his college jersey number of 13 was retired by the Dolphins in honor of Dan Marino, Tagovailoa chose to wear number 1.[57] 2020 season See also: 2020 Miami Dolphins season Tagovailoa signed his four-year rookie contract, worth 30 million, on May 11, 2020.[58] He passed his physical with the team in July 2020 to begin training camp,[59] but was named the backup to Ryan Fitzpatrick to start the season.[60] Tagovailoa made his debut appearance in a Week 6 game against the New York Jets, coming in relief of Fitzpatrick in the fourth quarter of a 24–0 win where he threw two passes for nine yards.[61] His NFL appearance was the first for a left-handed quarterback since Kellen Moore in 2015.[62] During the team's bye week, Tagovailoa was named the starter for their Week 8 game against the Los Angeles Rams.[63] On Tagovailoa's first career pass attempt as a starter, he was strip-sacked by Aaron Donald. Later in the game, Tagovailoa recorded his first career touchdown on a pass thrown to DeVante Parker.[64] In Week 11 against the Denver Broncos, Tagovailoa threw for 83 yards and a touchdown before being replaced by Fitzpatrick early in the fourth quarter with the Broncos leading 20–10.[65] Tagovailoa jammed his thumb in practice prior to a Week 12 game against the Jets and missed the game.[66] He made his return in Week 13 against the Cincinnati Bengals, where he threw for 296 yards and a touchdown during a 19–7 win.[67] In Week 14 during a narrow 33-27 defeat against the Kansas City Chiefs, Tagovailoa eclipsed the 300 passing yard mark in the NFL for the first time by passing for 316 yards and two touchdowns, plus with an additional rushing touchdown. His performance earned him Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week honors for back-to-back weeks.[68][69] In Week 16 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Tagovailoa threw for 94 yards and a touchdown before being benched in favor of Fitzpatrick again in the fourth quarter.[70] In Week 17 against the Buffalo Bills, needing a win for the Dolphins to qualify for the playoffs, Tagovailoa threw for a career-high 361 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions as Miami lost 56–26.[71] The Dolphins missed the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year, and for the 17th time in the 21 seasons since the retirement of Dan Marino.[72] 2021 season See also: 2021 Miami Dolphins season Tagovailoa in the 2021 NFL season: against the Patriots (left), against the Falcons (center) and against the Titans (right) Tagovailoa led the Dolphins to a Week 1 win over the New England Patriots, their divisional rivals. During Week 2 against the Bills, Tagovailoa suffered a rib injury early in the game, and was carted off the field on a motorized stretcher, not returning in that game.[73] Tagovailoa was later ruled out for the Dolphins Week 3 matchup against the Raiders, as it was revealed that he had fractured several ribs.[74] He was then placed on injured reserve on September 25, 2021,[75] and returned from injury in Week 6 against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. In his first game in nearly a month, Tagovailoa completed 33 of 47 passes for 329 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in a 23–20 loss to the Jaguars, dropping the Dolphins' record to 1–5.[76] The Dolphins lost two additional games to the Atlanta Falcons and Bills to drop their record to 1−7. The following week, Tagovailoa missed the Dolphins' Week 9 game against the Houston Texans, as the Dolphins won 17−9. In their next game against the Baltimore Ravens, Tagovailoa came off the bench to energize the Dolphins, completing 8 of 13 passes for 158 yards and a rushing touchdown, resulting in an upset 22−10 victory. Tagovailoa used the win to catapult a turnaround in his and his team's fortunes. The following week set the tone for the rest of the season, as he completed 27 of 33 passes for 273 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception as the Dolphins beat the Jets 24−17. He led the team to its first 7-game winning streak since 1985. During their 20−9 victory over the New York Giants in Week 13, he became the first Dolphins quarterback since Dan Marino in 1994 to throw at least 21 completions in the first half of a game.[77][78] In Week 17 against the Tennessee Titans, Tagovailoa and the Dolphins were blown out 34−3. Following their loss, and with the Los Angeles Chargers defeating the Broncos, the Dolphins were eliminated from playoff contention for the fifth consecutive year, and 18th time in 20 seasons. In the final game of the 2021 season, Tagovailoa led the Dolphins to their first sweep of the rival Patriots since 2000, making him 3−0 against Bill Belichick and the Patriots in his career.[79] He finished the 2021 season with 2,653 passing yards, 16 passing touchdowns, and ten interceptions to go along with 42 carries for 128 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in 13 games.[80] 2022 season See also: 2022 Miami Dolphins season During the offseason previous to the 2022 season, the Miami Dolphins fired head coach Brian Flores, arguing internal communication issues.[81] A few weeks later, several sources confirmed differences between Tagovailoa and Flores with rumors of heavy discussions between them. The Dolphins hired Mike McDaniel as their head coach on February 6, 2022, who expressed unbridled support for Tagovailoa as his starting quarterback.[82] Tagovailoa began the season throwing for 270 yards and a touchdown in a 20−7 win over the Patriots, improving to 4−0 against Bill Belichick and the Patriots.[83] The next week against the Ravens, Tagovailoa threw for a career-high 469 yards, six touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 42−38 comeback win.[84] The 21-point comeback was the first fourth-quarter comeback of 21+ points in 12 years. Prior to the game, teams were 0−711 when trailing by at least 21 points in the fourth quarter since 2011.[85] His six-touchdown performance also tied the Dolphins franchise record, tying Hall of Famers Bob Griese and Dan Marino,[86] and his 469 passing yards ranks fourth in franchise history.[87] As a result of his historic performance, Tagovailoa was named American Football Conference (AFC) Offensive Player of the Week for Week 2.[88] During Week 3 against the Bills, Tagovailoa briefly left the game with what the Dolphins claimed was a back injury but eventually returned to the game, finishing with 186 passing yards and a touchdown as the Dolphins won 21−19.[89] After the game, the NFLPA suspected that the Dolphins might have violated concussion protocols by letting Tagovailoa back in the game and subsequently announced that an investigation would be launched.[90][91] After being a game-time decision for Week 4, Tagovailoa was cleared to start against the Bengals. After taking a sack by Bengals nose tackle Josh Tupou during the second quarter, Tagovailoa hit the ground with his left elbow, back and back of his helmet. Tagovailoa demonstrated a fencing response and was stretchered off the field and transported to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center with head and neck injuries.[92][93] He was discharged from the hospital later that night.[94] Two days later, the NFL players' union fired their independent neurotrauma consultant who was involved in Tagovailoa's concussion check during the Bills game.[95] Tagovailoa's suspected concussion resulted in the NFL and NFLPA revising its concussion protocol policy.[96] Tagovailoa returned to practice on October 12, but remained in concussion protocol.[97] On October 15, Tagovailoa cleared concussion protocol, but remained inactive for the Week 6 game against the Minnesota Vikings.[98] Tagovailoa returned in Week 7 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he threw for 261 yards and a touchdown in the 16–10 win.[99] The next week against the Detroit Lions, Tagovailoa threw for 382 yards and three touchdowns while completing 80% of his passes in the 31–27 win. On December 21, despite topping the overall fan votes (306,861) for the 2023 Pro Bowl, Tagovailoa was not selected to the Pro Bowl.[100] Against the Green Bay Packers on Christmas Day, Tagovailoa threw for 310 yards, and a touchdown, but threw three interceptions in the fourth quarter, including the game-losing one to Rasul Douglas in the 26–20 loss.[101] The next day, it was announced that Tagovailoa had entered concussion protocol after he was experiencing concussion symptoms he suffered in the game.[102] On December 28, McDaniel confirmed Tagovailoa suffered a concussion and was ruled out for the Dolphins Week 17 game against the Patriots, and then also ruled out for the season finale against the Jets.[103][104][105] On January 9, the Dolphins clinched the AFC's final playoff berth, and their first since 2016.[106] On January 11, McDaniel said that Tagovailoa had not been cleared to return to practice since he entered concussion protocol a second time, and was ruled out for his third consecutive game.[107] Tagovailoa finished the regular season throwing for 3,548 yards, 25 touchdowns, and eight interceptions, going 8–5 in 13 games played.[108] Tagovailoa also led the league in passer rating and passing average.[109] 2023 season See also: 2023 Miami Dolphins season On March 20, 2023, the Dolphins picked up the fifth-year option of Tagovailoa's contract.[110] In his first news conference since December 2022, Tagovailoa said that he considered retirement in the off-season due to his injuries in the 2022 season.[111] Tagovailoa began the season throwing for 466 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception as the Dolphins won 36–34 against the Chargers.[112] For his performance, Tagovailoa was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 1.[113] In Week 2, Tagovailoa threw for 249 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the Dolphins' 24–17 win against the Patriots.[114] During Week 3 against the Broncos, Tagovailoa finished with 309 passing yards and 4 touchdowns. The Dolphins also combined for 350 rushing yards and won 70–20. Tagovailoa's exceptional play in these games earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September.[115] On January 3, 2024, it was announced that Tagovailoa had been selected for his first Pro Bowl appearance.[116] He was named as the starting quarterback of the AFC roster.[117] Tagovailoa finished the season with a league-leading 4,624 passing yards, becoming the first Dolphins quarterback to lead the league in passing yards since Dan Marino in 1992. Tagovailoa also generated career-highs in passing touchdowns (29), completions (388), and completion percentage (69.3%) in his fourth NFL season.[118] Tagovailoa made his playoff debut against the Chiefs in the Wild Card round, throwing for 199 yards with one touchdown and one interception in a 26–7 loss.[119] NFL career statistics Legend Led the league Bold Career best Regular season Year Team Games Passing Rushing Sacked Fumbles GP GS Record Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A Lng TD Int Rtg Att Yds Y/A Lng TD Sck SckY Fum Lost 2020 MIA 10 9 6−3 186 290 64.1 1,814 6.3 35 11 5 87.1 36 109 3.0 17 3 20 136 1 1 2021 MIA 13 12 7−5 263 388 67.8 2,653 6.8 65 16 10 90.1 42 128 3.0 23 3 20 152 9 1 2022 MIA 13 13 8−5 259 400 64.8 3,548 8.9 84 25 8 105.5 23 70 3.0 18 0 21 163 6 1 2023 MIA 17 17 11−6 388 560 69.3 4,624 8.3 78 29 14 101.1 35 74 2.1 9 0 29 171 13 5 Career 53 51 32−19 1,096 1,638 66.9 12,639 7.7 84 81 37 97.1 136 381 2.8 23 6 90 622 29 8 Postseason Year Team Games Passing Rushing Sacked Fumbles GP GS Record Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A Lng TD Int Rtg Att Yds Y/A Lng TD Sck SckY Fum Lost 2022 MIA 0 0 — Did not play due to injury 2023 MIA 1 1 0−1 20 39 51.3 199 5.1 53 1 1 63.9 3 25 8.3 14 0 2 11 0 0 Career 1 1 0−1 20 39 51.3 199 5.1 53 1 1 63.9 3 25 8.3 14 0 2 11 0 0 Player profile Tagovailoa has been noted for his throwing accuracy and touch, particularly in passes traveling over 20 yards in the air despite criticism of his arm strength. His awareness while scanning the field, avoiding defenders in the pocket and running have been highly touted,[120] with one source endearingly calling it his \\"Spidey-sense\\" in reference to the superhero Spider-Man.[121] In particular, Tagovailoa has been efficient in running the run-pass option, one of his strengths in college and early on in his professional career,[122] and his time to throw and time to release are among the fastest in the league.[123] However, his injury history has been extensive,[124] and he has struggled when defenses keep him in the pocket for extended periods of time and force him to improvise.[125] Since taking over as head coach, Mike McDaniel has utilized Tagovailoa's fast processing and decision-making skills as an integral part of the Dolphins' offense, which has relied heavily on rhythm, timing, fast receivers such as Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, and pre-snap assessment, allowing Tagovailoa's further development as a pocket passer.[121][126] Personal life Tagovailoa graduated early from Saint Louis School and moved with his family to Alabaster, Alabama, after his commitment to Alabama.[127] Tagovailoa is an evangelical Christian.[128] He has been married to his wife Annah since 2022. They have one son, Ace.[129][130] Although Tagovailoa is predominantly right-handed, his father trained him to throw the ball with his left hand as a child, because he wanted a left-handed son.[131] He is the only starting left-handed quarterback currently in the NFL. His younger brother, Taulia Tagovailoa, is a college football quarterback for the Maryland Terrapins. He transferred there in 2020 after spending a year as Tagovailoa's backup at Alabama in 2019.[127][132] Two of Tagovailoa's cousins also play football: Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa played on the defensive line on the Raiders; Adam Amosa-Tagovailoa played on the offensive line at Navy.[133] In 2023, Tagovailoa began practicing jiu-jitsu in response to the concussions he suffered in the 2022 NFL season.[111] Tagovailoa is a supporter of the Samoa national rugby league team, and publicly pledged his support to the team during the 2021 Rugby League World Cup where they made the Final for the first time.[134] Philanthropy In February 2021, Tagovailoa announced the establishment of the Tua Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to the support of youth initiatives, health and wellness, and other charitable causes. The foundation focuses its efforts in communities that have had the most prominent impact on Tua including Hawaii, Alabama, and Miami.[135] In recognition of the foundation launch, three grants of 16,667 (totaling 50,000) were awarded on February 4 to the Police Athletic League of North Miami, Big Oak Ranch in Springville, Alabama, and the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame in Honolulu.[136] In June 2020, Tagovailoa announced the establishment of a 300,000 scholarship endowment to benefit his high school, Saint Louis School in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi.[137] The Tua Foundation hosted its inaugural fundraising event in August 2021, raising 93,000 for the Tallapoosa County Girls Ranch to cover funeral expenses for the eight juveniles, ages 4–17, that were lost in a devastating car crash, and also counseling expenses to the girls of the ranch that lost loved ones.[138]","output":"Cameron McCaffrey c/o Boca Raton Achievement Center 500 NE Spanish River Blvd., Suite 30 Boca Raton, FL 33431 cmccaff1@fau.edu <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PHONE_NUMBER> Thursday, February 1, 2024 Mr. Tua Tagovailoa c/o Miami Dolphins 347 Don Shula Drive Miami Gardens, FL 33056 Dear Mr. Tagovailoa, I hope this message reaches you in excellent health and buoyant spirits amidst the excitement of a successful football season.

A 2x10 joist typically refers to a joist that is 2 inches thick by 10 inches deep (approximately 50mm x 254mm). When you mention a beam that is 100mm thick, it's important to know more than just the thickness to determine if 2x10 joists are suitable for use with that beam. The width and the material of the beam are also critical factors. In general, a joist's depth (10 inches in this case) does not have to match the beam's width or thickness directly. What's more important is whether the designed structure will be able to carry the intended loads safely. The connection between the beam and the joists must be properly designed to transfer the loads without causing any structural issues. To make sure the joists are properly sized and compatible with the beam, the following steps are usually taken: 1. Load Calculation: Determine the live loads (e.g., furniture, people) and dead loads (e.g., the weight of the joists, flooring materials) that the joists need to support. 2. Span Tables: Use span tables specific to your building code jurisdiction that take into account the species and grade of the lumber you are using for the joists. These tables will tell you the maximum span for a given joist size and spacing. 3. Beam Design: Ensure the beam is capable of supporting the combined loads from the joists and any other loads it has to carry. The material (e.g., timber, steel, laminated veneer lumber) and the size of the beam are significant factors here. 4. Joist-Beam Connection: Design a connection between the joists and the beam that can safely transfer the loads. This may involve joist hangers, ledger strips, or other types of connectors. 5. Building Codes and Permit: Consult with your local building department to ensure compliance with all relevant building codes and to obtain the necessary permits. It is highly recommended to work with a structural engineer or a qualified builder to determine the appropriate sizing and spacing for your joists and beams. They will take all these factors into consideration to ensure that the structural elements are adequate for the intended use."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular Valentines, one word only and add Valentines before the word","output":"Valentines Chocolate"},{"instruction":"In a mud pool, a blue alien was swimming in the mud, Other creatures saw her, After a while, she submerged and then her legs resurfaced, which then danced gracefully, moving elegantly, Other creatures marvelled at the beauty, Eventually with a splash, her legs vanished underneath, leaving only small bubbles to mark her presence, The mud would later bubble more, and then a bubbling spectacle began, Write a continuation where mud squirts into the air, as if a fountain, Bubbles appear like fireworks As the small bubbles continued to mark the blue alien’s submerged presence in the thick, viscous mud pool, the other creatures, who had paused their own play to observe, now waited in silent anticipation. Moments passed, and the mud began to churn more violently, the surface roiling with energy. Without warning, the serene scene erupted as a powerful jet of mud squirted high into the air, mimicking the grandeur of an earthen fountain. The sudden spectacle elicited gasps and chirps from the assembled creatures, their eyes wide with amazement. It was as though the blue alien, hidden from view, was the conductor of an orchestra, and the mud pool her instrument, playing a symphony of the earth. The stream of mud ascended skyward before succumbing to gravity, splattering back down with a multitude of satisfying plops, decorating the surrounding landscape with a fresh, muddy coat. As the initial geyser subsided, a series of smaller spouts followed in quick succession. Like a crescendo in nature’s symphony, the mud exploded upward, again and again, each burst higher and more forceful, bathing the area in a soft rain of earth. The timing of these eruptions became almost rhythmic, as if pulsing to the heartbeat of the planet itself. Then, as if choreographed by an unseen artist, bubbles formed at the surface, each catching the light in a dazzling display of iridescence. They danced and weaved amongst the sprays of mud, creating a natural spectacle akin to fireworks. The bubbles shimmered with vibrant colors, buoyed by the blue alien’s mysterious powers, seeming to celebrate the joy and wonder of this unique cosmic ballet. Eyes squinted and heads tilted back, the creatures watched the grand performance, a spontaneous testament to the magic hidden within their familiar mud pool. The laughter of gurgling bubbles and the spectacle of the continuously cascading muddy fountain blended into an unforgettable display, forever etched in the annals of this world’s natural wonders. The blue alien, still unseen below the surface, held the gaze of every creature present, her aquatic dance a mystery that enticed and enchanted, leaving them to wonder what other marvels existed just beneath the cover of their simple, muddy paradise. Write a finale where the bubbles slow down and stop, and then she resurfaces The exuberant display of mud and bubbling continued for what felt like an ageless moment, captivating the audience of creatures who had never witnessed such an event. But all performances, no matter how enthralling, must eventually draw to a close. Slowly, as if the energy were being drained from the spectacle, the mud fountains grew less forceful, the eruptions coming at longer intervals. The bubbles, which had soared like vibrant fireworks moments before, began to diminish in size and number. The color-infused orbs that had ascended to the heavens now rose only a few feet before softly bursting, leaving behind a fine mist that hovered over the settling pool. All eyes remained transfixed on the surface of the mud, which gently rocked and rippled as the last few bubbles perished with muted pops. The creatures’ breathing slowed in unison with the fading energy, anticipation building in the silent stillness that now hugged the area. The pool stilled to an eerie calmness, and the lively performance that had erupted without warning seemed now to be just a fond memory. Write later when one final bubble emerges, A pig stays there for hours and then sees her resurface slowly","output":"Hours passed with the occasional creature losing interest and wandering away, returning to their daily routines. However, one creature—a curious pig with a patchwork of bristles—remained rooted in place, its gaze locked on the now motionless mud pool, waiting for the encore that its instincts promised would come. The sun began its descent, casting an orange glow over the scene. Just when the pig began to question its own stubborn patience, a single bubble, larger than any before it, caught its eye as it surfaced in the middle of the pool. There was a profound stillness, as if the entire planet held its breath. The bubble oscillated delicately, reflecting the dying light of the day, creating a prism of colors that swirled upon its surface. Then, as gently as a whisper, the giant bubble popped—not with the expected ‘snap’ but with a soothing ‘whoosh,’ releasing a scented mist that hinted at the exotic flora of the world beyond. This seemed to be the cue the creatures of the land had been unknowingly awaiting. From the heart of the now-tranquil pool, something began to change. The thick, dark mud started to quiver and split, forming a perfect circle that grew wider with each passing second. And then, in a display that mirrored her initial descent, the blue alien gracefully resurfaced. First, the crown of her head broke through the surface, her skin glistening with droplets that caught the fading light. Then her eyes, shimmering with the wisdom of the stars from which she came, opened to meet the gaze of the faithful animal that had waited so long. She rose further, shoulders and arms emerging in an elegant stretch, every movement a silent sonnet to the harmony of this world. The blue alien paused, taking in her surroundings, meeting the eyes of the patient pig and the few lingering creatures with a knowing gaze. Then, with a smooth gesture, she directed her arms upward, beckoning the last of the light with her palms as if drawing down the stars themselves. The mud fell from her form in slow rivulets, revealing the majestic contours of her being. A final hush settled as the alien reached her full height, standing serenely upon the surface of the mud as if it were solid ground. The setting sun's rays crowned her in a halo of dusky twilight, and the creatures, now huddled together in quiet reverence, understood that they had witnessed not just a spectacle of nature, but a ballet of the cosmos, a dance of life and beauty orchestrated by one of its most enigmatic creatures. With a tilt of her head and a soft smile, the alien offered a silent farewell. She descended once more below the surface, leaving no trace of her presence, save for the pig's memory and a pool that was forever changed by the unearthly dance of the blue alien."},{"instruction":"Write a story the next day, where she doesn't resurface, and a hedgehog who stood there for hours thought she had drowned, but then she resurfaced and then walked to her spaceship, which then took off","output":"The following day dawned bright and clear, the sun casting its warm glow across the land, breathing life into every crevice and creature it touched. News of the prior day's mysterious performance had spread through the woodland, bringing with it a sense of wonder and an insatiable curiosity. Among the throng of creatures drawn to the now famous mud pool was a small, earnest hedgehog with quills like the bristles of an old brush, eager to catch a glimpse of the enigmatic blue alien. Throughout the morning, various animals took their places around the mud pool, their eyes flickering over the still surface. Time trudged on, but there was no sign of the alien. Noon passed into afternoon, and still, the pool lay quiet, as though holding onto a secret. The hedgehog, with persistence in its tiny heart, stood resolute by the water's edge. As the sun began to wane, unease crept upon the little creature. The hedgehog's mind spun with possibilities, the most distressing of which was that the blue alien had somehow drowned, trapped beneath the dense layer of mud. Hours trickled by, and the audience thinned once more, with many of the creatures succumbing to the reluctant conclusion that there would be no encore. Yet, the hedgehog stayed, its gaze never leaving the surface of the pool. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting an orange and purple farewell as the first stars began to wink into existence. It was then, in the soft embrace of twilight, that the water’s surface began to ripple gently. At first, the hedgehog's heart leaped with hopeful joy, but the joy soon gave way to trepidation. Small bubbles appeared, steadily growing in frequency and size, until finally - a head crowned with blue skin broke through the surface, dispelling all fears of tragedy. It was the alien, and she was very much alive. She climbed out of the mud pool with the same grace as she had the previous day, leaving a trail of pearl-like droplets in her wake. The hedgehog, overcome with relief, watched with wide, shiny eyes. The alien, sensing the tiny creature's unease, turned and offered it a nod of acknowledgment, a silent reassurance that all was well. Then, without a word, she strode purposefully across the clearing, the hedgehog trailing a respectful distance behind, curiosity overcoming its initial hesitation. They arrived at a small, secluded glade, where a sleek spaceship lay camouflaged by the surrounding foliage. Its design was unfamiliar, with graceful curves and a seamless surface that seemed to absorb the fading light. The craft was a silent testament to the wonders and advancements far beyond this simple woodland. The blue alien touched the hull of her ship, and a hatch silently opened. She turned, casting a final glance over her shoulder at the hedgehog, who by now had gathered the courage to approach the edge of the glade. In that glance was a universe of stories left untold and adventures yet to be had. With a gentle upwards motion, the spaceship lifted into the cool evening air, the thrum of its engines soft, almost musical. The hedgehog watched in awe as the ship ascended higher, its form shrinking until it was nothing more than a star among stars. And so, the blue alien departed, leaving behind a tiny hedgehog forever touched by the extraordinary encounter, and a mud pool whose secrets were now a little bit deeper, a little bit more magical. The woodland creatures slept soundly that night, unknowingly under the watchful gaze of their visitor from another world, whose spaceship now sailed among the constellations, journeying onwards in the grand tapestry of the cosmos."},{"instruction":"Write the hedgehogs thoughts \\"What happened to her, Has she drowned?\\" And then after she left \\"That was amazing\\"","output":"As the hedgehog stood vigil by the mud pool, the weight of the passing hours felt heavy on its small shoulders. The surface of the mud remained unperturbed, a still mirror reflecting a sky that slowly transitioned from blue to dusky shades of twilight. An unsettling thought burrowed its way into the hedgehog's mind, spiraling into a loop of worry: \\"What has happened to her? Has she drowned?\\" The quiet dread punctuated each heartbeat, setting a rhythm of anxiety. The little creature tried to recall every detail that led to her disappearance into the muddy depths, searching for a missed clue that might explain her prolonged absence. Concern painted itself across the hedgehog's features in a display of wrinkled brow and twitching nose. Then, in a moment that mirrored the hedgehog's deepest hopes, the familiar figure of the blue alien emerged, dispelling the ominous questions that had plagued the small, spiny spectator throughout the day. As she walked away from the pool and toward the camouflaged spaceship, the hedgehog's tense quills relaxed, and a wave of awe replaced its earlier fret. The hedgehog remained motionless long after the alien vanished into the sky, the spectacle of the graceful departure seared into memory. With twinkling eyes upturned to the stars, the countryside's nocturnal choir rising all around, the hedgehog's thoughts shifted from concern to exhilaration: \\"That was amazing,\\" it marveled in silent reflection. Such words were simple, yet they captured the totality of its experience—one tiny hedgehog peering into the infinite, having touched something far greater than the underbrush and foliage it called home. In a quiet whisper of thought, seeded with newfound wonder, the hedgehog connected with the vast and distant unknown, its heart beating in time with the boundless universe."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artValentines Chocolate","output":"\\"Valentine's Chocolate | Romantic Art for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Love-Inspired Design | Gift for Sweethearts\\""},{"instruction":"quien paga la seguridad social de un contratista en colombia, el mismo contratista o el contratante","output":"En Colombia, el régimen de seguridad social para los contratistas independientes es diferente al de los empleados con contrato de trabajo. La responsabilidad de realizar los pagos a la seguridad social para un contratista depende del tipo de contrato y de la naturaleza de la relación entre el contratante y el contratista. Para los contratistas que operan bajo la modalidad de contrato de prestación de servicios (también conocido como contrato civil por servicios), generalmente son ellos mismos los responsables de realizar sus propios aportes a la seguridad social. Esto incluye salud, pensión y riesgos laborales. La ley colombiana exige que los contratistas independientes se afilien y coticen al sistema de seguridad social, basando sus aportes en el valor del contrato y siguiendo las normativas establecidas para los trabajadores independientes. Por otro lado, si la relación entre el contratante y el contratista es en realidad una relación laboral encubierta, es decir, si se evidencia que hay subordinación, horario de trabajo, cumplimiento de órdenes, entre otros aspectos que caracterizan un contrato laboral, el contratante podría ser responsable de hacer los aportes a la seguridad social como si se tratase de un empleado. Esto es debido a que la ley busca proteger los derechos de los trabajadores y evitar la elusión de las obligaciones laborales por parte de algunas empresas que contratan bajo la figura de prestación de servicios cuando en realidad se está configurando una relación laboral.

Estos contratos son comunes cuando el empleador no requiere que el empleado trabaje la jornada completa o cuando el trabajador busca una mayor flexibilidad en su horario. En muchos países, los contratos a tiempo parcial están regulados por la ley laboral y otorgan derechos similares a los trabajadores de tiempo completo, pero proporcionalmente ajustados al número de horas trabajadas. A continuación, se describen algunas características generales relacionadas con los contratos a tiempo parcial: 1. **Horas de trabajo**: El contrato especifica claramente el número de horas por semana, mes o año que el empleado está obligado a trabajar. Estas horas son menos que las de un contrato a tiempo completo. 2. **Derechos y beneficios**: Los trabajadores a tiempo parcial generalmente tienen los mismos derechos que los trabajadores a tiempo completo, incluyendo vacaciones pagadas, días festivos, y protección contra el despido injustificado, pero estos beneficios suelen ser proporcionales al número de horas trabajadas. 3. **Seguridad Social**: Los trabajadores a tiempo parcial deben cotizar a la seguridad social, como cualquier otro trabajador. No obstante, las contribuciones y los beneficios pueden ser proporcionales a su salario y jornada laboral. 4. **Salario**: El salario para un trabajador a tiempo parcial suele calcularse en proporción al salario de un trabajador a tiempo completo en una posición equivalente, ajustado al número de horas trabajadas. 5. **Oportunidades de empleo complementario**: Los empleados a tiempo parcial pueden tener la posibilidad de combinar varios empleos a tiempo parcial para alcanzar un equivalente a una jornada completa, si así lo desean y el tiempo lo permite. 6. **Conversión a tiempo completo**: En algunos casos y bajo ciertas condiciones, los trabajadores a tiempo parcial pueden tener derecho a solicitar un cambio a un contrato a tiempo completo si surge la oportunidad dentro de la empresa. En Colombia, al igual que en otros países, existen regulaciones específicas aplicables a los contratos a tiempo parcial, y es esencial que empleadores y empleados comprendan las leyes locales para garantizar que se respeten todos los derechos y obligaciones correspondientes. Los detalles de los contratos a tiempo parcial, como el número de horas y los beneficios asociados, deben negociarse y acordarse entre el empleador y el empleado, y dicha información debe quedar reflejada en el contrato laboral."},{"instruction":"que significa ABM dentro de este contexto: Alcanzar el crecimiento de nuevo MRR esperado por la empresa, a través de ABM e inbound.","output":"Dentro del contexto que proporcionas, \\"ABM\\" hace referencia a \\"Account-Based Marketing\\" (Marketing Basado en Cuentas).

La pregunta es: ¿Si quiero contratar a una empleada domestica que trabaja 1 solo dia a la semana, pero dicha persona es una persona que es catalogada como contribuyente en la seguridad social de colombia, cuanto me costaria el pago de su seguridad social mensualmente.","output":"El Decreto 1072 de 2015 establece las normas generales para los empleadores y trabajadores en Colombia. Sin embargo, para el cálculo específico de la seguridad social de un empleado doméstico que trabaja un día a la semana, hay que referirse también a otras normativas que rigen estos aspectos. En Colombia, el sistema de seguridad social integral incluye los siguientes componentes: salud, pensión y riesgos laborales. Hasta donde alcanza mi conocimiento, en el caso de empleadas domésticas que trabajan por días, existe una modalidad especial de afiliación a la seguridad social que se hace a través del Sistema de Afiliciación Transaccional del Seguro Social (Sisben) y que está diseñada para empleados que no trabajan de manera continua o que sus ingresos varían. Debes registrar el pago de aportes a seguridad social conforme a los días que realmente trabaje durante el mes. Aquí se aplican los porcentajes estándar sobre la base de un día de salario mínimo legal vigente por cada día trabajado. Para 2023, el salario mínimo mensual en Colombia está alrededor de 1,000,000 COP, por lo que, si la empleada está trabajando un día a la semana, estaríamos hablando de aproximadamente 4 días al mes. Los porcentajes están distribuidos de la siguiente manera: - Salud: 12.5% - Pensión: 16% - Riesgos laborales: varía según la clase de riesgo, pero para una empleada doméstica suele ser mínimo (clase I). Basado en estos datos, para calcular el costo mensual de la seguridad social de la empleada doméstica que trabaja un día por semana, primero se debe determinar el valor del salario por día trabajado y luego aplicar los porcentajes correspondientes. Suponiendo un salario mínimo diario de aproximadamente 33,333 COP (1/30 de 1,000,000 COP), la empleada que trabaja cuatro días al mes ganaría un total de 133,332 COP. Multiplicando esto por los porcentajes correspondientes tendríamos: - Salud: 133,332 COP * 12.5% = 16,666.50 COP - Pensión: 133,332 COP * 16% = 21,333.12 COP - Riesgos Laborales: depende de la clase de riesgo, pero asumamos que es del 0.52% como mínimo para la clase I: 133,332 COP * 0.52% = 693.33 COP La suma total sería aproximadamente, dependiendo de la fecha y valores exactos, de 38,693 COP mensuales. Es esencial verificar estos cálculos con la normativa vigente y las tarifas actualizadas, ya que dichos valores pueden cambiar anualmente. También es recomendable utilizar las herramientas de cálculo que la Unidad de Gestión Pensional y Parafiscales (UGPP) y otras entidades afines ofrecen o consultar con un contador o especialista en nómina para confirmar los montos exactos."},{"instruction":"EKTA GAJWANI Student | MSc Finance | DCU <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PHONE_NUMBER> <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 5 Tolka Cottages, Dublin 11, Ireland SUMMARY As an aspiring graduate seeking entry into the dynamic world of finance and investment banking, I bring a strong academic foundation from my master's program at DCU, where I have excelled in courses such as Introductory Econometrics and Financial Statement Analysis.

In the context of corporate activities, negative externalities often manifest as environmental degradation, social impact, or health risks that are not accounted for in a company's balance sheet. When companies neglect these externalities, they can face significant financial, legal, and reputational damage—as exemplified by various ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scandals and industrial accidents. This commentary critically examines how not internalizing these external costs has led to dire consequences for some firms and proffers a theoretical framework for integrating these costs to create value. One of the most notorious cases illustrating the importance of internalizing externalities is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, orchestrated by BP. The disaster caused massive environmental harm to the Gulf of Mexico, including the death of wildlife, destruction of habitats, and long-term ecological disturbances. While the immediate financial cost to BP was staggering—an estimated 65 billion in clean-up costs, fines, and compensation—the spill also had profound implications for the firm's reputation and long-term financial health. If BP had invested more resources in risk mitigation, safety protocols, and best-practice drilling technologies, the company could have substantially lessened the disaster's likelihood, demonstrating prudent management of potential externalities. Examining this example through a critical lens, we must question BP's expert assessments of the risks involved in offshore drilling and whether the company thoroughly considered the potential environmental consequences. The relevance of context—the pressure to maximize profit in a competitive market—also likely influenced the decision-making that led to the accident. Another example is the case of Volkswagen’s emissions scandal, where the company installed \\"defeat devices\\" in vehicles to cheat emissions tests. This unethical practice was an attempt to circumvent regulations aimed at reducing the negative externality of air pollution. The scandal had severe financial implications for Volkswagen, including billions in fines, diminished stock value, and damaged trust with consumers and regulators. Volkswagen's response post-scandal has involved investing in electric vehicles and renewable energy—efforts to internalize and mitigate the costs of environmental impact. These case studies illustrate how overlooking externalities can result in a severe underestimation of risk, highlighting the need for firms to adopt a comprehensive view of their operations' potential social and environmental impacts. Proactive investment in sustainability and safety measures can preclude devastating incidents and exemplify corporate stewardship. Further, by questioning the assumptions held by executives and stakeholders about cost-saving vs. safety-investment tradeoffs, companies can reinvent their risk assessment frameworks to prioritize the internalization of externalities. Progressive and informed leadership must consider the broader implications of their decisions. This includes challenging the status quo where short-term gains are valued over long-term sustainability and ethical conduct. In my view, corporations can internalize these costs for value creation by embedding ESG goals into their corporate strategies. This approach involves redefining what value means—a synchrony of financial performance and positive impact on society and the environment. By instituting robust risk management frameworks that factor in externalities, companies can maneuver away from potential pitfalls that would otherwise harm both society and their bottom line. Investments in cutting-edge technologies for emission reductions, enhanced safety protocols, and community engagement initiatives can pave the way for mitigating the risks of externalities. Additionally, transparent reporting and active stakeholder involvement in ESG matters can bolster a company's accountability and foster an authentic culture of sustainability. The limits of this position are acknowledged: the complexities of integrating externalities are considerable, and different industries face unique challenges in this endeavor. Moreover, the pace of policy and technological development influences the rate at which firms can realistically internalize externalities. In conclusion, a failure to internalize the costs of negative externalities can lead to colossal falls from grace for corporations, as exhibited by BP and Volkswagen. Avoiding such outcomes necessitates a forward-thinking approach that incorporates ESG considerations into all facets of corporate decision-making. In this way, companies can avoid the pitfalls of externalities, creating true value that resonates with shareholders, customers, and society at large. The implications of this shift are profound, marking a potential sea change in how business defines success and measures profitability in an increasingly conscious global market."},{"instruction":"فرق

La stratégie de communication ne doit pas faire évoluer la programmation fixée pour les prochaines saisons. La communication pourra envisager des événements Indoor et outdoor pour servir cette ambition. La stratégie de communication devra intégrer les principes d'une communication responsable (socialement et écologiquement parlant) et les contraintes d e la communication culturelle. Vous devrez donc nous proposer un concept d'évènement avec un plan de communication.","output":"Voici un plan pour concevoir une stratégie de communication responsable pour Le 104, en intégrant des actions de sensibilisation et des événements qui mettent l'accent sur la durabilité et l'engagement culturel: **1. Comprendre la mission et les valeurs du CENTQUATRE-PARIS:** - Identifiez les éléments clés qui font de Le 104 un lieu unique: la promotion des arts, le soutien à la création contemporaine, l'innovation et la durabilité. - Alignez les objectifs de communication avec ces valeurs. **2. Développer un concept d'événement responsable:** - Imaginer un événement écoresponsable qui met en valeur les arts et l'innovation, tout en sensibilisant le public à l'impact environnemental et social. Par exemple, une exposition d'art faite de matériaux recyclés ou une série d'ateliers sur la création artistique durable. **3. Ciblage:** - Déterminez le public cible (habitants locaux, touristes, famille, communauté artistique, etc.). - Pensez à une approche inclusive en vous assurant que l'événement et les communications sont accessibles à un large éventail de personnes. **4. Planification des communications:** - Créez un agenda de promotion intégrant les différentes phases avant, pendant et après l'événement. - Utilisez des canaux de communication durables, comme les médias sociaux, le marketing par courriel, et des affiches en matériaux recyclés ou recyclables. - Encouragez l'engagement du public à travers des appels à action (p. ex. ateliers participatifs, compétitions artistiques en ligne). **5. Partenariats et collaborations:** - Cherchez des partenaires partageant les mêmes valeurs éthiques et environnementales. - Intégrez des acteurs locaux (écoles, associations, entreprises vertes) pour créer des synergies et élargir l'impact de l'événement. **6. Communication interne et formation:** - Assurez-vous que le personnel et les bénévoles soient formés sur les pratiques de communication responsable et sur les détails du concept de l'événement. **7. Mesures écoresponsables:** - Mettez en œuvre des pratiques durables pour l'événement (réduction des déchets, économie d'énergie, recyclage). - Proposez des alternatives de transport durable pour accéder à l'événement. **8. Évaluation et reporting:** - Créez des indicateurs pour évaluer l'impact environnemental et social de l'événement. - Communiquez transparentement sur les résultats et les leçons apprises. **9. Plan de communication:** - Rédigez les messages clés qui véhiculeront les valeurs de responsabilité sociale et environnementale. - Adaptez ces messages aux différents canaux de communication et aux différents publics cibles. **10. Budget:** - Déterminez le budget disponible, en tenant compte des coûts pour une communication et un événement responsables. - Cherchez des formes de financement alternatives si nécessaire (crowdfunding, mécénat). **Exemple d'événement: « L'Art de la Durabilité au 104 »** - Lancement d'une exposition où les artistes utilisent des matériaux recyclés et proposent des œuvres axées sur des thèmes écologiques. - Organisation d'ateliers participatifs où les participants peuvent apprendre des techniques artistiques durables. - Conférences et tables rondes avec des intervenants spécialisés dans l'art, l'innovation et la durabilité. - Incitations pour les visiteurs qui optent pour des moyens de transport écologiques (vélo, covoiturage, etc.). - Campagne de sensibilisation en amont sur les réseaux sociaux utilisant des hashtags comme #ArtResponsable104 pour générer de l'engagement.

Continue en copiant mon style : Cas pratique : Le Cent-quatre Paris J’ai pour mission de créer un évènement qui engagera le 104 dans une politique de développement durable afin que ce dernier devienne un établissement culturel exemplaire. Afin de saisir la totalité des enjeux de cette campagne de communication, commençons par revenir sur ses objectifs. Dans un premier temps, cet évènement doit permettre au 104 de s’engager dans une politique de développement durable, mais également de valoriser son engagement pour gagner en notoriété afin d’inspirer d’autres lieux culturels. Ainsi, il conviendrait que cet évènement réponde à un concept innovant qui attirerait les foules afin que le 104 puisse par la suite, les faire adhérer aux valeurs mises en avant. J’ai donc pensé qu’il serait intéressant de mettre en place un évènement au concept innovant qui permettrait de toucher un public assez large et assez susceptible d’être réceptif aux valeurs mises en avant par le 104. Une bonne stratégie de communication est une stratégie à la cible bien définie. Nous allons donc ici tenter de cerner au mieux ceux que nous visons à travers cette campagne. Nous observons que l’analyse des cibles du 104 révèle une clientèle assez diversifiée, comprenant à la fois des amateurs pointilleux d’arts, des familles désireuses de se divertir ou même des entrepreneurs intéressés par la façon qu’a le 104 de repousser les limites de l’expression artistique. Cette clientèle est motivée par plusieurs facteurs que l’on pourrait départager en quatre catégories : 1. Exprimer sa créativité et son sens artistique ; 2. Découvrir de nouvelles formes d’art et d’expression ; 3. Faire des expériences culturelles ludiques et éducatives ; 4. Découvrir de nouvelles opportunités de collaboration et d’innovation. Ici, nous allons avant tout chercher à toucher un public n’ayant pas forcément beaucoup de connaissances dans le domaine de l’art et de la culture. J’ai donc décidé d’ouvrir une nouvelle galerie d’art au sein des locaux du 104 qui sera essentiellement virtuelle. Elle sera composée d’une multitude d’œuvres contemporaines représentant chacune des paysages naturels. Le client aura la possibilité de voyager dans les œuvres, et ce en escaladant simplement le rebord du tableau. Chaque œuvre mettra en valeur la beauté de la nature, incitant le public à voir les choses d’un œil neuf, à lui réapprendre à s’émerveiller devant un beau paysage. Il sera ainsi plus facilement touché par les enjeux du développement durable. J’intégrerai des points d’information sur les enjeux environnementaux à chaque paysage représenté afin de sensibiliser le public aux questions de protection de l’environnement, de conservation des ressources naturelles et de lutte contre le changement climatique. Les artistes utilisant des matériaux écologiques ou recyclés seront priorisés. En effet, ils ne seront pas exposés en raison de leur popularité, mais plutôt en raison de leur investissement pour les causes environnementales. La réalité immersive coûtant assez cher en terme de ressources de la fabrication de nos équipements, nous veillerons à ne nous procurer qu’une dizaine d’équipements. Nous tenons en effet à ce que cet évènement soit éco-responsable jusqu’au bout, désireux de nous aligner avec les valeurs que nous mettront en avant dans ce projet.","output":"Cas pratique : Le Cent-quatre Paris Suite à la réflexion entamée, nous entrons dans le vif du sujet en affinant notre concept et notre stratégie pour cet évènement au CENTQUATRE-PARIS qui aura pour ambition de galvaniser autour d'une communication responsable, éco-consciente et engagée en faveur du développement durable. **Concept de l'événement : \\"Art'Vert – Le monde en œuvre\\"** \\"Art'Vert – Le monde en œuvre\\" sera une exposition virtuelle unique qui, grâce à une technologie de réalité augmentée, permettra de traverser physiquement les cadres des œuvres pour explorer l'interconnectivité de l'art, de la nature et de la technologie. Cette immersion sensorielle dans les paysages naturels sera agrémentée de données interactives éveillant la conscience environnementale. **Stratégie de Communication :** 1. **Communication Digitale:** - Lancement d'une campagne sur les réseaux sociaux avec des hashtags #ArtVert104 et #EcoArtExpérience104, pour construire le buzz autour de l'événement. - Développement de contenus Web interactifs tels que des visites virtuelles préalables de l'exposition et des interviews avec les artistes engagés dans la démarche environnementale. 2. **Relations Presse et Publiques:** - Organisation d'une conférence de presse pour présenter l'initiative, accompagnée d'une visite privée pour les influenceurs culturels et les journalistes spécialisés en art et développement durable. - Collaboration avec des écoles et des universités pour sensibiliser les étudiants et les inviter à l'exposition, engendrant ainsi un effet viral auprès des jeunes publics. 3. **Marketing Événementiel Responsable:** - Utilisation de matériaux recyclés et recyclables pour la scénographie de l'événement physique et des supports de communication. - Mise en place d'un système de billetterie électronique pour réduire l'utilisation du papier. 4. **Partenariat et Mécénat:** - Recherche de partenaires et de mécènes ayant un intérêt dans les domaines de l'art, de la technologie et du développement durable. - Proposer des partenariats avec des entreprises vertes pour l'équipement technologique nécessaire à l'exposition. 5. **Mesures Éco-responsables:** - Sensibilisation à l'accessibilité en transport collectif et promotion des moyens de transports durables pour se rendre à l'événement. - Limiter autant que possible l'empreinte carbone de l'événement en choisissant des fournisseurs locaux et en utilisant une technologie économe en énergie. 6. **Feedback et Analyse d'Impact:** - Mise en place d'un système de feedback auprès des visiteurs pour mesurer l'impact de l'événement sur leur compréhension des enjeux du développement durable. - Évaluation post-événement pour mesurer les retombées en termes de notoriété et d'engagement du public. En conclusion, cet événement doit être un pivot central pour Le 104 dans la représentation de son investissement environnemental et artistique. Il encapsulera la philosophie du lieu tout en offrant une expérience innovante et mémorable qui incitera le public à prendre conscience et à se questionner sur leur propre impact sur l'environnement. L'éco-conception, la synergie culturelle et l'engagement communautaire se rejoindront pour créer un événement susceptible d’inspirer et d'établir une nouvelle norme dans le domaine des institutions culturelles."},{"instruction":"il faut que tu gardes ce que j'ai écrit","output":"Cas pratique : Le Cent-quatre Paris J’ai pour mission de créer un évènement qui engagera le 104 dans une politique de développement durable afin que ce dernier devienne un établissement culturel exemplaire.

Cette clientèle est motivée par plusieurs facteurs que l’on pourrait départager en quatre catégories : 1. Exprimer sa créativité et son sens artistique ; 2. Découvrir de nouvelles formes d’art et d’expression ; 3. Faire des expériences culturelles ludiques et éducatives ; 4. Découvrir de nouvelles opportunités de collaboration et d’innovation. Avec la création de notre galerie d’art virtuelle, nous allons avant tout chercher à toucher un public assez général. Nos cibles principales seront les personnes initiées à l’art, mais peu à l’écologie, car nous comptons sur leur curiosité artistique pour les motiver à faire l’expérience des Fenêtres de la Nature, et les personnes engagées dans la protection de l’environnement. Nos cibles secondaires incluront les familles, les entrepreneurs et les touristes. Leur intérêt pour la galerie étant conditionné par plusieurs facteurs, nous ne choisissons donc pas de les viser particulièrement par notre communication. Notre positionnement se définirait donc comme un événement vous transportant au cœur de la nature, vous inspirant à agir pour sa préservation, et vous invitant à découvrir l'art sous un nouveau jour. Nous vous invitons à vivre une expérience unique qui allie l'art, la technologie et l'engagement environnemental, tout en restant accessible et ouverte à tous. Dans la continuité de ce positionnement, nos axes de communication sont : - L’expérience immersive et novatrice de l’art numérique. - Les actions concrètes du 104 en matière d’éco-responsabilité. - L’engagement des artistes pour l’environnement à travers l’utilisation de matériaux durables. La promotion de cet événement se fera principalement en ligne afin de minimiser notre impact carbone. Nous créerons une page dédiée aux Fenêtres de la Nature sur le site Internet du 104 qui réunira toutes les informations pratiques liées et permettra de réserver sa place en ligne. Une bonne partie de la communication se fera sur Instagram et Facebook, afin de partager des vidéos de l’expérience qui parleront plus que de longues explications. Nous ferons plusieurs publications qui appuieront successivement sur les dimensions artistiques, technologiques et environnementales de l’évènement dans le but de toucher quiconque ayant un intérêt pour au moins l’un de ces domaines. L’e-mailing jouera également un rôle important, car nous enverrons des invitations personnalisées à notre liste de diffusion. Nous avons également prévu d’organiser des pré-visites pour certains influenceurs que nous aurons contactés, tels que Hugo Clément ou Lily Fairly. Nous comptons sur eux pour mettre en lumière notre combat et ainsi augmenter la notoriété du 104 en tant qu’établissement engagé dans les questions écologiques. Nous prévoyons également de faire des partenariats avec des collèges et des lycées, afin de sensibiliser les jeunes. Afin d’inaugurer les Fenêtres de la Nature, nous organiserons également une soirée de lancement qui accueillerait presse, VIP, artistes et militants pour une première découverte immersive.","output":"Le paragraphe que vous avez fourni semble être bien écrit et ne contient pas de fautes d'orthographe flagrantes. Cependant, voici quelques petites corrections et suggestions stylistiques pour améliorer la clarté et le style professionnel du texte : 1. Attention à l'unicité des guillemets utilisés pour le titre de l'exposition. Utiliser soit les guillemets français « Fenêtres de la Nature », comme vous l'avez majoritairement fait, soit les guillemets anglais \\"Fenêtres de la Nature\\", mais ne pas mélanger les deux. 2. Le terme \\"terme\\" devrait être au pluriel. Il faudrait donc écrire \\"en termes de ressources\\" plutôt que \\"en terme de ressources\\". 3. Pour une cohérence typographique, lorsque vous énumérez des points, il faut veiller à la ponctuation. Ainsi, après \\"dans le but de toucher quiconque ayant un intérêt pour au moins l'un de ces domaines\\", il serait plus approprié d'insérer un point à la fin de cette énumération, plutôt qu'un point-virgule. 4. Il y a une répétition dans \\"Nous avons également prévu d’organiser des pré-visites\\". Il vaut mieux reformuler pour éviter cette redondance. Par exemple : \\"Nous planifions également des visites en avant-première pour certains influenceurs...\\" En résumé, le texte est très clair et professionnel, mais de légères corrections de cohérence et de ponctuation pourraient le peaufiner davantage."},{"instruction":"et là : Le CENTQUATRE-PARIS, reconnu pour son engagement dans le domaine culturel et artistique, est fier de vous annoncer l’ouverture des “Fenêtres de la Nature”, une galerie d’art virtuelle qui encourage une prise de conscience environnementale à travers une immersion artistique innovante. Cette expérience unique invitera les visiteurs à voyager au sein d’œuvres d’art contemporaines représentant des paysages naturels. En ravivant l’émerveillement pour la nature, l’exposition a pour ambition de sensibiliser aux dangers qui la menacent. Les “Fenêtres de la Nature”, ce n’est pas seulement une galerie d’art : c’est une initiative du CENTQUATRE-PARIS pour s’engager pleinement dans une politique de développement durable. Elle vise à renforcer la notoriété du lieu comme établissement culturel exemplaire, capable d’inspirer d’autres acteurs du secteur de la culture à suivre cette voie plus que jamais urgente. Le CENTQUATRE-PARIS invite les médias, les influenceurs et le grand public à rejoindre cet élan novateur pour une culture durable.","output":"Dans le paragraphe que vous avez fourni, il y a quelques petits ajustements à apporter pour l'uniformité et la correction. 1. Les guillemets anglais \\"Fenêtres de la Nature\\" devraient être remplacés par des guillemets français pour suivre la norme typographique du français : « Fenêtres de la Nature ». 2. Il semble manquer des informations complémentaires sur les \\"dangers qui menacent la nature\\". Peut-être pourriez-vous être légèrement plus spécifique pour contextualiser les enjeux environnementaux auxquels l'exposition souhaite sensibiliser ? 3. Il pourrait être utile d'intégrer une incitation à l'action ou une déclaration de mission plus marquée pour renforcer l'impact du message concernant le développement durable. Mis à part ces suggestions, le texte est correct du point de vue de l'orthographe et de la grammaire. Il communique clairement l'introduction d'une nouvelle initiative culturelle et environnementale par Le CENTQUATRE-PARIS."},{"instruction":"pourquoi lana del rey porte des lunettes à coeur ?","output":"Lana Del Rey, connue pour son style vintage et glamour, a souvent été vue portant des lunettes de soleil en forme de cœur. Cet accessoire qui fait écho à l'esthétique des années 60 et 70 est devenu une sorte de signature pour elle, et contribue à son image de chanteuse avec un style nostalgique et romantique. Lana Del Rey adopte régulièrement des pièces qui font référence à l'histoire de la mode et qui collent à son identité artistique. Les lunettes en forme de cœur peuvent être perçues comme un choix de mode qui renforce son image de femme fatale moderne avec un penchant pour le rétro. De plus, les célébrités utilisent parfois des accessoires pour se distinguer et créer une image de marque reconnaissable. Dans le cas de Lana Del Rey, ses choix vestimentaires et d'accessoires, y compris ses lunettes emblématiques, aident à forger une identité visuelle mémorable qui séduit ses fans et alimentent l'imaginaire autour de sa musique et de ses performances. Il est important de noter que les raisons personnelles derrière le choix de porter des lunettes à cœur, ou tout autre accessoire, par Lana Del Rey ne sont publiques que dans la mesure où elle-même les partage. Tout autre explication pourrait être une interprétation des fans ou des observateurs de la mode."},{"instruction":"ca s'appelle comment l'effet ou je vois qqn avec des lunettes et dans le reflet de ses lunettes il y a cette personne avec ses lunettes etc","output":"L'effet que vous décrivez s'appelle l'effet de mise en abyme ou effet Droste. Il s'agit d'une image récursive ou auto-référentielle, où une image en contient une version plus petite d'elle-même, et cette smaller version contient à son tour une version encore plus petite, et ainsi de suite, créant potentiellement une régression à l'infini. L'effet Droste est souvent utilisé en art, en photographie et en graphisme pour créer un effet visuel intrigant et captivant qui attire le regard et stimule la curiosité. Le nom de cet effet provient d'une marque hollandaise de cacao, Droste, dont la boîte montrait une infirmière tenant une boîte de cacao Droste qui, à son tour, montrait une infirmière tenant une boîte de cacao, et ainsi de suite. Dans le cas de la réflexion dans les lunettes, l'image capturée dans le reflet montrerait la même scène de manière répétée en réduction, donnant l'impression d'une régression sans fin. Cet effet peut être réalisé naturellement à travers des reflets ou être fabriqué à l'aide de techniques de retouche photo ou de graphisme."},{"instruction":"et cela signifierait quoi graphiquement parlant ? qu'est ce que ca pourrait suggerer ?","output":"Graphiquement parlant, l'effet de mise en abyme ou effet Droste peut suggérer plusieurs idées ou concepts selon le contexte dans lequel il est utilisé : 1. **Infini et Répétition :** Il suggère une continuation sans fin, comme si l'image pouvait se répéter éternellement. Cela peut évoquer des concepts tels que l'infini, l'éternité ou la continuité. 2. **Complexité et Profondeur :** Utiliser ce type d'effet peut indiquer que quelque chose a de multiples couches ou niveaux de complexité, ajoutant une dimension de profondeur à l'œuvre. 3. **Réflexivité :** L'effet peut signifier que le sujet est engagé dans une forme de réflexion ou d'auto-analyse, se reflétant sans cesse lui-même. 4. **Réalité vs Illusion :** Il peut questionner notre perception de la réalité ou jouer sur la notion d'illusion, en brouillant la ligne entre ce qui est réel et ce qui est simplement un reflet ou une image. 5. **Illumination ou Connaissance :** Dans certains contextes, en particulier philosophiques ou mystiques, cet effet peut représenter le processus d'illumination ou la recherche de la connaissance, où chaque niveau de réflexion apporte une compréhension plus profonde. 6. **Voyage ou Exploration :** Il peut symboliser un voyage qui entraîne le spectateur dans un espace de découverte ou d'exploration sans fin. 7. **Narration et Structure :** En littérature ou au cinéma, une mise en abyme peut servir à structurer une histoire dans une histoire, et graphiquement, peut suggérer une construction similaire avec une image dans une image. 8. **Technique et Artisanat :** Sur le plan artistique, il peut être utilisé pour démontrer la compétence technique et le savoir-faire de l'artiste ou du graphiste. 9. **Interaction et Engagement :** Cet effet attire souvent l'attention et peut engager le spectateur à regarder plus attentivement pour démêler la répétition visuelle. 10. **Thématique d'Écho ou de Résonance :** Il peut suggérer une résonance ou un écho d'idées, de thèmes ou de motifs à travers différentes échelles ou contextes. En fait, l'interprétation de l'effet Droste dépend beaucoup de la manière dont il est intégré dans l'œuvre globale, des éléments qu'il contient, et du message ou de l'émotion que l'artiste souhaite transmettre."},{"instruction":"corrige les fautes : Le croquis en première page de ce document donne une idée de la pochette d’album que j’aurais proposé à Lana del Rey.

Voici quelques idées de garnitures pour des gaufres salées : 1. **Fromage et Jambon :** Un classique - ajoutez du fromage râpé et des tranches de jambon sur la gaufre pendant la cuisson pour qu'ils fondent ensemble. 2. **Saumon Fumé :** Garnissez la gaufre de saumon fumé, d'un filet de crème fraîche et de ciboulette ciselée. Ajoutez éventuellement un peu d'avocat ou des œufs de poisson pour plus de raffinement. 3. **Œufs :** Que ce soit des œufs brouillés, au plat ou pochés, ils se marient très bien avec les gaufres. Vous pouvez les accompagner de bacon ou de saucisse pour plus de saveur. 4. **Légumes Grillés :** Des aubergines, courgettes, poivrons grillés arrosés d'un filet d'huile d'olive et saupoudrés de parmesan créent une option végétarienne délicieuse. 5. **Pulled Pork :** De l’échine de porc effilochée (pulled pork) assaisonnée avec du barbecue ou sauce aigre-douce peut être une garniture riche et goûteuse. 6. **Pesto et Tomates :** Du pesto vert ou rouge étalé sur la gaufre avec des tranches de tomates fraîches et de la mozzarella pour une version gaufre \\"caprese\\". 7. **Guacamole :** Pour une version Tex-Mex, garnissez avec du guacamole, un peu de salsa et de la crème sure. Ajouter du poulet ou du bœuf haché épicé pour une touche extra. 8. **Ratatouille :** Pour une touche provençale, servez les gaufres avec de la ratatouille, un mélange de légumes mijotés. 9. **Fromage de Chèvre et Miel :** Pour une touche sucrée-salée, tartinez la gaufre de fromage de chèvre et arrosez-la d'un filet de miel. Vous pouvez ajouter des noix concassées pour du croquant. 10. **Fondue de Poireaux ou d’Oignons :** Carameliser des poireaux ou des oignons et les étaler sur votre gaufre pour un résultat crémeux et savoureux. 11. **Chili Con Carne :** Garnissez votre gaufre avec du chili con carne et du fromage râpé pour un repas complet. 12. **Fromage Bleu et Poires :** Pour les amateurs de fromages forts, mariez le fromage bleu avec des poires tranchées pour une combinaison gagnante. 13. **Tapenade et Anchois :** Étalez de la tapenade noire ou verte et disposez quelques filets d'anchois sur le dessus. 14. **Champignons Sautés :** Des champignons sautés avec de l'ail, du thym ou du persil feront excellente figure sur une gaufre salée. 15. **Caviar d’aubergine :** Étalez du caviar d’aubergine pour une option végétalienne délicieuse. Vous pouvez bien sûr combiner plusieurs de ces ingrédients selon vos préférences et n'hésitez pas à expérimenter pour créer de nouvelles saveurs. Les gaufres salées sont très polyvalentes et peuvent être adaptées à de nombreux goûts et régimes alimentaires."},{"instruction":"Hi!","output":"Hello!

It converts these annotations to the BED (Browser Extensible Data) format, which is useful for genome browsing and visualization. To run this Perl script, you should have Perl installed on your system. You can check if Perl is installed by typing \`perl -v\` in your terminal. If Perl is not installed, you would need to install it first. Here's how you can run the Perl script: 1. Save the script to a file, for example, \`gff_to_bed.pl\`. 2. Make sure the script is executable. You can change its permissions with the \`chmod\` command: \`\`\`bash chmod +x gff_to_bed.pl \`\`\` 3. Run the script with your input file. Replace \`<your_input_file>\` with the path to your GFF or similar file: \`\`\`bash ./gff_to_bed.pl <your_input_file> \`\`\` For example, if your file is called \`annotations.gff\`, you would run: \`\`\`bash ./gff_to_bed.pl annotations.gff \`\`\` 4. If your file is compressed (\`.gz\` or \`.zip\`), the script should handle that automatically. 5. The script can output additional information if you pass the \`-x\` option. 6. The output will be printed to the standard output (console). If you want to save the output to a file, you can redirect it: \`\`\`bash ./gff_to_bed.pl <your_input_file> > output.bed \`\`\` 7. If you encounter any errors or permissions issues, make sure that you have the necessary programs like \`gunzip\` or \`unzip\` installed and in your PATH, and that you have read permissions for the input file. Remember that this script appears to process GFF2 and GFF3 formats differently and expects specific commenting conventions to determine the version of GFF it is working with. The script might not work with all GFF files without modification if they do not follow the expected conventions."},{"instruction":"while staying true to the source material, write a comedic and detailed Outlander story about Jamie Fraser deciding to relax in a pond near his home. he undresses and tosses his clothes on the ground. he’s now in the buff. give a comment on his butt and physique. he goes outside to the pond near his home. describe how he looks entering the pond and relaxing. describe how his face looks as he lets out a fart in the water, enjoying the relief afterwards. some of the fish go belly-up due to the fart’s awful smell.

Sae, ae fine afternoon, he set his mind tae enjoyin' the cool serenity o' the wee pond just over the brae from his beloved Lallybroch. \\"Ach, it's time fer a bit o' peace and quiet, away from the Sassenachs and the endless broil o' rebel causin',\\" Jamie muttered to himself as he sauntered over, his red mane gleaming in the sunlight. When he reached the tranquil water, Jamie spared nae a second thought afore he began sheddin' his clothes with reckless abandon, his garments landin' in a purposeful heap on the ground. In the buff now, his back to the world, it was hard nae tae comment on his well-shaped posterior, which seemed sculpted from the very stone o' the highlands. 'Twas a sight that could inspire poets—if they were brave enough tae write such scandalous verses. \\"Aye, 'tis a fine day tae bear it all,\\" Jamie said with a cheeky grin, gien a quick glance over his shoulder as if tae ensure that his arse hadnae gone unnoticed by the local wildlife. He made his way tae the pond's edge, the sun kissin' his fair skin and turnin' it as rosy as his hair. Jamie's muscular frame moved with the grace o' a stag as he waded into the cool embrace o' the water—a sight that would've made the nymphs and dryads o' ol' green with envy. Aye, the water was fresh, and Jamie tilted his heid back, lettin' out a contented sigh as he settled into the pond's soothing grasp. 'Twas his very oasis, and the world outside the water's edge couldnae touch him here. As the quiet ripples lapped against him, Jamie allowed a rare moment o' solace tae wash over him, his face wearin’ the contentment only found in the embrace o' Mother Nature herself. But nature had other plans, and Jamie belied his genteel appearance with an earth-shattering fart that bubbled tae the surface with comic ferocity. His face twisted in a mix o' relief and amusement as the water around him frothed like a witch's cauldron. \\"Och, I shouldnae ha' had that extra helpin' o' neeps and tatties!\\" Jamie exclaimed, chuckling tae himself as he witnessed the aftermath o' his indiscretion. Tae his mirth—and perhaps a wee bit of pride—some of the fish near him went belly-up, stunned beyond measure by the sheer force o' his Scottish wind. After a hearty laugh, Jamie peered down at his aquatic victims, and spyin' an opportunity, he plucked one o' the floating fish from the water. \\"Might as well nae let it go tae waste,\\" he said, the twinkle in his eye almost as bright as the fire he set tae make with flint and steel—a skill honed through necessity and not a wee bit o' defiance. As the fire crackled tae life, Jamie skewered the ill-fated fish on a sharp stick and held it over the flame. \\"Well, my scaly friend, ye've given yer all in service tae a hungry Highlander. Rest assured, yer sacrifice willnae be forgot,\\" Jamie mused aloud, watchin' as the fish began tae sizzle. The smoky smell of cookin' fish mingled with the fresh air, and Jamie settled back, content with his simple meal amidst nature's splendor. Perchance 'twas nae the quiet afternoon he had imagined, but 'twas a day well-spent by Jamie Fraser's reckonin'. And if the fish of Lallybroch learned to fear the mighty wind o' a relaxin' Scot, then sae be it. There were worse legends tae be told in the land o' his birth."},{"instruction":"Generate several pilots for the upcoming \\"Armoured Core VI: Fires of Rubicon\\". Describe the pilot and mech. If there is enough room, generate the opening scene between this pilot, and his mech, before against the player-character's mech.","output":"Pilot 1: Captain Elena \\"Phoenix\\" Sardo Mech: Crimson Talon Description: Captain Elena \\"Phoenix\\" Sardo earned her callsign from the legendary rebirth of her career, rising from a devastating failure that cost her team dearly. To the surprise of many, she returned with a vengeance. She pilots the Crimson Talon, a formidable mech known for its agility and precision. Clad in a sleek red and black armor, the Talon boasts advanced heat-dissipation systems and a pair of lethal plasma swords optimized for close-quarters combat. Elena's command of the mech is like a deadly dance, making her an unpredictable adversary. Opening Scene: A vast swathe of the battlefield lay in ruins, the desolate evidence of the war raging across the Rubicon sectors. Captain Elena Sardo stood contemplative within the cockpit of the Crimson Talon, her eyes fixed on the horizon. She had been tracking an up-and-coming pilot, someone who had piqued her interest with impressive combat skills. \\"Remember, Phoenix, don't underestimate this one,\\" her comms officer warned, his voice a static-tinged whisper in her ear. Elena cracked a small smile, \\"Worry not, I live for the challenge.\\" As the player-character's mech appeared in the distance, Elena tightened her grip on the control sticks. Crimson Talon came to life, its engines humming a promise of the battle to come. With a leap, the mech dashed across the barren field, closing the distance, and as the two mechs faced off under the shadow of a dying star, the dance of death began. Pilot 2: Lieutenant Jax \\"Ironside\\" Corbin Mech: Goliath Vanguard Description: Lieutenant Jax Corbin is a mountain of a man, both in stature and reputation. Nicknamed \\"Ironside\\" for his unyielding nature and his mech's thick armor, he is a seasoned veteran whose sheer resilience makes up for any lack of finesse. Goliath Vanguard is a titan surrounded by impenetrable armor plating and fitted with heavy artillery capable of long-range devastation. Its slow movements are offset by explosive firepower, including a heavy railgun and missile silos integrated into its back. Opening Scene: The atmosphere was charged with the electricity of imminent confrontation. Lieutenant Jax \\"Ironside\\" Corbin stood resolute inside Goliath Vanguard's command module, a fortified bubble of steel and projection screens. The mech's hydraulics hissed quietly, a moment of calm before the storm. Ironside's tactical display flagged the visual of an approaching mech - an outlier with a reputation that was growing just a bit too fast for comfort. It was time for a demonstration of power, a reminder of the old guard's strength. With a thunderous advance that shook the ground beneath it, Goliath Vanguard marched toward the player-character's mech. Ironside's voice rumbled over the public frequency, \\"Experience trumps youth, rookie. Let me show you how the big guns play the game.\\" The two mechs, one a monolith and the other lithe and ready, stood opposed on a landscape scarred by the embers of conflict, each waiting for the other to make the first move. Pilot 3: Nils \\"Vagrant\\" Einar Mech: Whisper Edge Description: Nils \\"Vagrant\\" Einar is a shadowy figure whose past is as enigmatic as the mech he commands. Rumored to have once been affiliated with high-tier covert operations, his experience in stealth and sabotage is unmatched. Whisper Edge is an emblem of technological subterfuge, outfitted with adaptive camouflage and a light frame for quiet movement. Armed with a pair of silenced energy rifles and EMP disruptors, it is a ghost on the battlefield, striking from where it is least expected. Opening Scene: Silence reigned supreme on the edge of the Rubicon sector. Nils Einar, known in the tight-knit circles of mech combat as \\"Vagrant,\\" surveyed the land through Whisper Edge's advanced sensors, the mech almost invisible against the rugged terrain with its camouflage engaged. Suddenly, sensors picked up a trace - a new player on the field, someone yet to be marked by the Vagrant's ledger. Nils' fingers danced over the controls, a half-smile crossing his lips at the prospect of outsmarting another would-be hero. The player-character's mech, oblivious to the lurking danger, wandered into Whisper Edge's domain. In a flash of deceptive fluidity, Nils maneuvered his mech out of hiding, the EMP disruptors charging with a soft whine. \\"Time to fade into myth,\\" he murmured, as he unleashed an electromagnetic pulse designed to cripple the player's mech systems, initiating a battle where every shadow could spell demise."},{"instruction":"Generate several pilots for the upcoming “Armoured Core VI: Fires of Rubicon” game.

Her mech, the Azure Striker, is a medium-class machine that trades heavy armor for speed and maneuverability. Equipped with dual plasma rifles and a cutting-edge energy shield, Azure Striker is designed to hit hard and fast, disorienting opponents before they can mount a defense. Opening Scene: The Azure Striker crouched behind an outcropping of scorched earth, its blue armor almost blending with the flickering flames and smoky haze of the battlefield. Sergeant Knox's voice cut through the cockpit's hum, layered with anticipation. \\"Alright, Striker, let's see if the new kid has any tricks.\\" As the player-character's mech came into view, Rhea throttled up, propelling the Azure Striker forward with a burst of acceleration. Jets flared as she launched over the debris, her voice thundering through the comm-link as she opened a channel to the opposing pilot. \\"Hope you've got more than just shiny paint there. Let's dance!\\" The two mechs charged, the distance between them disappearing in an instant, triggering an electric clash of metal titans. Pilot 2: Dr. Felix \\"Neuron\\" Voss Mech: Mind's Eye Description: Dr. Felix Voss, endearingly called \\"Neuron\\" by those who respect his cognitive approach to combat, is a scientist turned pilot. He applies his intellect to every engagement, preferring strategy over brute force. His mech, the Mind's Eye, is a walking supercomputer equipped with advanced AI and sensory equipment. Its weaponry includes precision lasers and a tactical missile system that can adapt to target weak points in enemy armor. Opening Scene: Inside the Mind's Eye's cockpit, Dr. Voss studied the data streams flowing across his screens, his eyes reflecting the complexity of the algorithms at work. \\"Neuron to Command, I am engaging the opponent. Calculating optimal strike patterns now.\\" The player-character's mech, a silhouette against the chaos of battle, emerged as the focal point in Felix's intricate web of predictive warfare. He initiated combat protocols, the Mind's Eye shifting to distribute power to weapons systems. As the distance closed, the Mind's Eye's lasers glowed a menacing purple. Dr. Voss's voice was calm, almost academic, as he hailed the other pilot. \\"You are about to become a case study in the art of war. I trust you'll provide valuable data.\\" With precise movements, the Mind's Eye advanced, a chessmaster setting the board as it began its deadly gambit. Pilot 3: Captain \\"Hellfire\\" Maddox Mech: Scorched Earth Description: Captain Maddox, simply called \\"Hellfire\\" by both allies and foes, is a rugged survivalist with a penchant for incendiary theatrics. He lives for the heat of combat and pilots the Scorched Earth, a heavy assault mech designed to withstand intense firepower and deliver devastation in kind. Its armament includes thermobaric rocket launchers and a heavy flamethrower designed to flush enemies from cover and leave nothing but ash in its wake. Opening Scene: The ground sizzled, remnants of a recent salvo from Scorched Earth. Maddox, encased in the glowing cockpit of his fire-bathed mech, chuckled as the heat sensors spiked. \\"Scorched Earth, let's turn up the heat even more. Show 'em a real inferno.\\" On the horizon, the opponent's mech approached, seemingly undeterred by the desolate landscape. Maddox initiated the flamethrower, the weapon emitting a low growl before unleashing a searing tide toward his adversary. Opening a channel, Maddox's gravelly voice boomed across the battlefield, tinged with a pyromaniac's glee. \\"Welcome to the furnace, rookie! I hope you brought marshmallows!\\" Tanks on Scorched Earth’s back glowed ominously as the mech advanced, a behemoth of fire and destruction heralding a trial by flame for the player-character."},{"instruction":"Generate questions about accounting and finace","output":"1.

Remember that the amount you earn from Google AdSense depends on a variety of factors, including the niche of your site, the location and behavior of your audience, the type of content you provide, and the amount of traffic your website receives. Here are steps you can take to create a website that may potentially earn 1,000 per month from Google Ads: 1. **Choose a Profitable Niche**: Research niches that have a high potential for traffic and monetization. Niches with high commercial value such as finance, health, technology, and education often have higher Cost Per Click (CPC) rates. 2. **Identify Target Audience**: Clearly define your target audience and tailor the content to match their preferences, needs, and search behaviors. 3. **Create High-Quality Content**: Develop informative, engaging, and original content that provides value to the reader. High-quality content can lead to higher search rankings, more traffic, and more ad clicks. 4. **Focus on SEO**: Optimize your website for search engines. Use keywords effectively, build quality backlinks, and ensure your site is mobile-friendly and has fast loading times. 5. **Regularly Update Content**: Post new content consistently to keep your audience engaged and to show search engines that your website is active. 6. **Build Traffic**: Employ various strategies to drive traffic to your site such as social media marketing, email marketing, guest posting, and collaborating with other content creators in your niche. 7. **Optimize Ad Placement**: Test different ad placements to find the most effective layout for your site. Make sure the ads are visible without being intrusive to the user experience. 8. **Monitor Performance**: Use analytics to monitor your website's performance, and adjust strategies as required to improve traffic and engagement. 9. **Comply with Policies**: Adhere strictly to Google's AdSense policies to avoid being banned or penalized. 10. **Expand Monetization Strategies**: Consider diversifying your income streams by exploring affiliate marketing, sponsored content, selling digital products, or memberships in addition to AdSense revenue. To provide a perspective, even if you are able to get a 1 CPC (which is a reasonable assumption in several high-value niches), you would need 1,000 clicks a month to earn 1,000. If you have a click-through rate (CTR) of 1%, which is average, you would need 100,000 page views a month to hit 1,000 clicks. Generating this level of traffic often requires substantial effort and time. Be patient and persistent. Most successful websites take time to build up to a point where they are earning significant revenue from AdSense or other advertising platforms. Keep learning and adapting your strategies, and with consistent effort, your website may reach the targeted revenue goals."},{"instruction":"could you be more specific? we use php language to make a service, something like schedule planner, calculator etc. Could you describe 10 most profitable service single full stack programmer can make?","output":"Creating a profitable web service as a single full-stack developer involves finding a balance between what is in demand, what you are skilled at building, and what can be monetized effectively.

However, if you really need to send form data without JavaScript and you want to include values from inputs outside of the form element, there are a couple of workarounds. Here are some methods to consider: # 1. Use Hidden Inputs Inside the Form You can duplicate the value of the input outside the form into a hidden input inside the form. This is typically done with JavaScript, but you can also pre-set the value on the server-side if the value is known at page render time. \`\`\`html <form action=\\"submit.php\\" method=\\"post\\"> <!-- The hidden input inside the form --> <input type=\\"hidden\\" name=\\"externalValue\\" value=\\"ValueFromOutside\\"> <!-- Other form fields --> <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"regularInput\\"> <input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Submit\\"> </form> <!-- Input field outside of the form --> <input type=\\"text\\" value=\\"ValueFromOutside\\" name=\\"outsideInput\\"> \`\`\` # 2. CSS Tricks You can visually position input fields outside of the form using CSS while they still remain within the form in the HTML structure. \`\`\`html <form action=\\"submit.php\\" method=\\"post\\"> <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"insideForm\\" style=\\"position: absolute; top: -9999px\\"> <input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Submit\\"> </form> <div style=\\"margin-bottom: 20px;\\"> Move your input here visually via CSS. <!-- The input is visually here, but really inside the form --> </div> \`\`\` # 3. Form Attribute (HTML5) In HTML5, you can use the \`form\` attribute on the input element to associate it with a form elsewhere in the document. \`\`\`html <form action=\\"submit.php\\" method=\\"post\\" id=\\"myForm\\"> <input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Submit\\"> </form> <!-- This input field is outside of the form element but is associated with the form by ID --> <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"outsideInput\\" form=\\"myForm\\"> \`\`\` Please note that the \`form\` attribute may not be supported by all browsers (it's not supported in Internet Explorer, for example), so check compatibility if you plan to use this method. Each of these methods effectively allows you to work with input values outside of a form element in some way, but for proper form structure and behavior, it's best to keep inputs inside their associated form tags whenever possible. If you need sophisticated form behaviors, it's worth considering using some JavaScript to ensure compatibility and maintainability of your code."},{"instruction":"how many unique values crc32","output":"The CRC32 algorithm (Cyclic Redundancy Check) generates a 32-bit hash value. Because it is 32 bits in length, there are 2^32 different possible combinations of values. This means that CRC32 can generate a total of 4,294,967,296 unique hash values. It is worth noting, however, that while there are over 4 billion unique hash values, CRC32 is not collision-proof. This means that two different input values can potentially result in the same CRC32 hash. Therefore, CRC32 is typically used for detecting accidental changes to raw data, such as network or storage errors, and is not suitable for cryptographic purposes where collision resistance is required."},{"instruction":"what is shortest collision proof hash","output":"There is no such thing as an entirely \\"collision-proof\\" hash function due to the Pigeonhole Principle. Given a fixed output size, if you generate enough inputs, you will eventually find two distinct inputs that hash to the same output; this is known as a collision. However, cryptographic hash functions are designed to make finding collisions computationally infeasible. This strength is typically quantified by the bit length of the hash's output. Generally, the longer the hash output, the more secure it is against collisions. Among cryptographic hash functions, those with shorter outputs are less collision-resistant simply because there are fewer possible hash values. For example, MD5 produces a 128-bit hash, which is considered insecure due to vulnerabilities that allow for relatively easy generation of collisions. SHA-1, producing a 160-bit hash, is stronger than MD5 but also considered vulnerable to collision attacks as demonstrated in practice. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions, including SHA-256 and SHA-512, is widely used and considered secure for most practical applications. SHA-256, in particular, generates a 256-bit hash, which offers strong collision resistance. SHA-3 is the latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family of standards and is designed to provide at least the same level of security as SHA-2. SHA-3 allows for hash outputs of different lengths, such as 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits. For applications that need shorter hashes due to space or transmission constraints and where security is still a concern, truncated versions of secure hashes are sometimes used. For example, SHA-256/128 is a truncated version of SHA-256 where only the first 128 bits of the hash are used. While this reduces the collision resistance compared to the full hash, it can be an acceptable trade-off in certain contexts. But it's important to understand that truncating a hash compromises its security to some degree, and the specific requirements of the situation should guide whether and how much truncation is acceptable."},{"instruction":"collision probability in crc32 vs md5","output":"The probability of a collision occurring increases with the number of hash outputs generated, as described by the Birthday Paradox or Birthday Problem. This is a statistical phenomenon which states that in a set of randomly chosen people, there is a surprisingly high probability that two of them will have the same birthday. For hashing algorithms, this means that the likelihood of two inputs producing the same hash (a collision) becomes significant even when the number of outputs is much smaller than the number of possible hashes the algorithm can generate. The probability of a collision can be approximated using the formula for the Birthday Problem: [ p(n) approx 1 - e^{-n^2 / (2m)} ] Where: - ( p(n) ) is the probability of a collision - ( n ) is the number of hashes - ( m ) is the number of possible hash outputs for the function - ( e ) is the base of the natural logarithm Using this approximation, here's how CRC32 and MD5 compare: For **CRC32**, which has an output space of ( 2^{32} ) (approximately ( 4.3 times 10^9 )), the probability of a collision becomes significant when the number of generated hash outputs exceeds a few tens of thousands, well before reaching the \\"birthday bound\\" of around ( 77,000 ) hash outputs. The birthday bound is when the probability of a collision is approximately 50%. For **MD5**, which has an output space of ( 2^{128} ) (approximately ( 3.4 times 10^{38} )), the probability of a collision becomes significant at around ( 2^{64} ) (about ( 1.8 times 10^{19} )) hash outputs, due to the ( n^2 ) term in the birthday probability formula. To sum up, the collision probability for CRC32 is significantly higher than that of MD5 because of its smaller output space. While CRC32 can start seeing collisions after a relatively small number of hashes, MD5 requires an astronomically larger number before collisions are likely. However, due to advances in cryptographic research, MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for security-sensitive applications, as practical collision attacks exist that can generate collisions in far fewer attempts than predicted by the Birthday Paradox."},{"instruction":"how to reduce hash length of md5 to let say 10 symbols","output":"To shorten the length of an MD5 hash (or any hash) to a specific number of symbols, you would typically use truncation. An MD5 hash is a 128-bit value commonly represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number. Each hex digit (0-9, A-F) represents 4 bits, so 10 hex characters represent 40 bits of the original hash. Here's how you can truncate an MD5 hash to 10 symbols: 1. Compute the full MD5 hash of the input data. 2. Convert the 128-bit hash into its 32-character hexadecimal string representation. 3. Take the first 10 characters of the hexadecimal string. Here's an example in Python: \`\`\`python import hashlib def truncate_md5(full_hash, length=10): return full_hash[:length] # original input input_data = \\"example data\\" # compute full md5 hash full_md5_hash = hashlib.md5(input_data.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest() # get truncated hash short_hash = truncate_md5(full_md5_hash, 10) print(f\\"Full MD5 hash: {full_md5_hash}\\") print(f\\"Truncated MD5 hash (10 symbols): {short_hash}\\") \`\`\` This Python function computes the MD5 hash for the string \\"example data\\" and then truncates the resulting hash to the first 10 characters. **Important Considerations:** - Truncating the hash like this significantly reduces its uniqueness and therefore increases the probability of collisions. - A truncated MD5 hash should not be used for cryptographic security purposes due to its vulnerabilities and the increased collision risk from truncation. - The shorter the resulting hash, the less secure and more collision-prone it will be. A 10-symbol hexadecimal hash has much less entropy than the original 32-symbol MD5 hash. If you require a shorter hash for reasons of space but still need a level of collision resistance, you may want to consider using a cryptographic hash function that outputs a shorter hash by design, like SHA-256, and then truncate as desired. However, for any cryptographic or security-related application, you should be cautious with truncating hashes and always assess the risks and trade-offs."},{"instruction":"Hi!","output":"Hello!

To do this, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script, then run: \`\`\` chmod +x script_name.pl \`\`\` Replace \`script_name.pl\` with the name of the Perl script file. 4. **Run the script**: - In the terminal (Unix-like systems) or Command Prompt/Powershell (Windows), navigate to the directory where you've saved the script, and run it using the Perl interpreter like so: \`\`\` perl script_name.pl \`\`\` Again, make sure to replace \`script_name.pl\` with the actual script name. 5. **Use Command-line Arguments** (if required): - Some Perl scripts may require command-line arguments to run correctly. Make sure to read the documentation or use the \`--help\` option if available, to understand how to use the script properly. 6. **Install Dependencies** (if the script requires external modules): - The Perl script might use external modules that don't come with Perl's default installation. If that's the case, you'll need to install these modules from CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network). You can do this by running: \`\`\` cpan Module::Name \`\`\` Replace \`Module::Name\` with the name of the module you need to install.

The partial fraction decomposition is [frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = frac{A}{x - 1} + frac{B}{x + 1}] We need to find the values of A and B such that the equation holds. Multiply through by the denominator (x^2 - 1) to clear the fractions: [1 = A(x + 1) + B(x - 1)] Setting up the system and solving for A and B through coefficients comparison or by plugging in suitable x values: For (x = 1), [1 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)] [1 = 2A] (A = frac{1}{2}) For (x = -1), [1 = A(-1 + 1) + B(-1 - 1)] [1 = -2B] (B = -frac{1}{2}) Now we rewrite the integral with the found coefficients A and B: [int_{2}^{infty} frac{1}{x^2 - 1} , dx = int_{2}^{infty} left(frac{1/2}{x - 1} - frac{1/2}{x + 1}right) , dx] Split the integral and integrate term by term: [int_{2}^{infty} left(frac{1/2}{x - 1}right) , dx - int_{2}^{infty} left(frac{1/2}{x + 1}right) , dx] These are simple logarithmic integrals; integrate each term: [frac{1}{2}ln|x - 1| Big|_{2}^{infty} - frac{1}{2}ln|x + 1| Big|_{2}^{infty}] Now we apply the limits.

We can perform a trigonometric substitution for the integral (int_{2}^{infty} frac{1}{x^2 - 1} , dx) by recognizing that we can use the hyperbolic trigonometric functions. The substitution we will use is (x = cosh(theta)), where (cosh(theta) = frac{e^theta + e^{-theta}}{2}). The derivative of (cosh(theta)) with respect to (theta) is (sinh(theta) = frac{e^theta - e^{-theta}}{2}), so (dx = sinh(theta) dtheta). Now, let's make the substitution: [x^2 - 1 = cosh^2(theta) - 1 = sinh^2(theta)] Thus the integral becomes: [int frac{1}{sinh^2(theta)} sinh(theta) dtheta] Let's simplify it: [int frac{1}{sinh(theta)} dtheta] Now we use the identity (sinh(theta) = frac{e^theta - e^{-theta}}{2}) to write: [int frac{2}{e^theta - e^{-theta}} dtheta] This integral can be further simplified by using the substitution (u = e^theta), (du = e^theta dtheta): [int frac{2}{u - frac{1}{u}} frac{du}{u}] Now let's write the integrand with a common denominator: [int frac{2u}{u^2 - 1} du] Notice that this is the same integral we started with, but now in terms of (u) instead of (x). Hence, we can directly apply the partial fractions we found earlier: [int left(frac{1}{u - 1} - frac{1}{u + 1}right) du] Integrating this term by term: [ln|u - 1| - ln|u + 1|] We have to switch back to our original variable (x), remembering that (u = e^theta) and (x = cosh(theta)). We want to express (e^theta) in terms of (x). We can achieve this by noting: [e^theta = frac{x + sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{2}] [e^{-theta} = frac{x - sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{2}] Substituting these back in: [lnleft|frac{x + sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{2} - 1right| - lnleft|frac{x + sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{2} + 1right|] As (x) approaches infinity, (x + sqrt{x^2 - 1}) simplifies to (2x), and both (|2x - 2|) and (|2x + 2|) approach (2x), so their logarithms approach each other, and the difference approaches zero. Applying the limits, at (x = 2), we have: [lnleft|sqrt{3} + 1right| - lnleft|sqrt{3} - 1right|] This evaluates to: [lnleft(sqrt{3} + 1right) - lnleft(sqrt{3} - 1right)] Now we simplify with the logarithm properties, noticing that (ln(a) - ln(b) = lnleft(frac{a}{b}right)): [lnleft(frac{sqrt{3} + 1}{sqrt{3} - 1}right)] The difference of squares within the logarithm allows for further simplification: [lnleft(frac{(sqrt{3} + 1)(sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1}right)] [lnleft(frac{3 + 2sqrt{3} + 1}{2}right)] [lnleft(frac{4 + 2sqrt{3}}{2}right)] [lnleft(2 + sqrt{3}right)] So, the final value of the integral from 2 to infinity is: [lnleft(2 + sqrt{3}right)]"},{"instruction":"use the substituition x = a sec theta where a = 1","output":"Certainly!

We need to evaluate the integral in the limit as (theta) approaches (frac{pi}{2}) from the left because (sec(theta)) goes to infinity as (theta) goes to (frac{pi}{2}^{-}). Thus, the integral becomes: [lim_{theta to frac{pi}{2}^{-}} (ln|sin(theta)|) - ln|sinleft(frac{pi}{3}right)|] Since (sin(frac{pi}{3}) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), [lim_{theta to frac{pi}{2}^{-}} (ln|sin(theta)|) - lnleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)] As (theta) approaches (frac{pi}{2}), (sin(theta)) approaches 1, so the logarithm of it approaches 0.

First, we express (1/sin(x)) as: [ frac{1}{sin(x)} = csc(x) = csc(x) cdot frac{csc(x) + cot(x)}{csc(x) + cot(x)}.] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{1}{sin(x)} = frac{csc^2(x) + csc(x) cot(x)}{csc(x) + cot(x)}.] Next, we set (u = csc(x) + cot(x)) and (dv = csc^2(x) + csc(x) cot(x), dx), then we find (du) and (v): [ du = (-csc(x) cot(x) - csc^2(x)), dx,] [ v = ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|.] The integration by parts formula is: [ int u , dv = uv - int v , du.] Using the chosen (u) and (dv), and since (du) and (v) are negatives of each other, the integral simplifies to: [ int frac{1}{sin(x)} , dx = ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + C,] where (C) is the constant of integration. This result can also be derived using trigonometric identities and other methods, but this approach with the identity and integration by parts is one efficient way."},{"instruction":"find domain and range of f(x,y) =3x+5y+2","output":"The function (f(x,y) = 3x + 5y + 2) is a linear function of two variables, (x) and (y). Let's find its domain and range. Domain: The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (pairs ((x, y)) in this case) for which the function is defined. For the given linear function, there are no restrictions on the values that (x) and (y) can take. (x) and (y) can be any real numbers because there are no operations like division by zero or taking the square root of a negative number that restrict the values of (x) and (y). Therefore, the domain of (f(x,y)) is ( mathbb{R}^2), which is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers. Range: The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. For the given function (f(x,y)), since (x) and (y) can take any real values, the function can produce any real value as well. There are no restrictions on the output value that the linear function can produce. For any real number (k) that we might want to be the output of the function, we can solve the equation (3x + 5y + 2 = k) for (y) (or (x)) using arbitrary (x) (or (y)) to find a corresponding (y) (or (x)). Therefore, the range of (f(x,y)) is all real numbers, or ( mathbb{R}). In summary: - Domain: ( mathbb{R}^2 ). - Range: ( mathbb{R} )."},{"instruction":"int _0^1:int _y^{sqrt{2-y^2}}:sqrt{x^2+y^2}","output":"To solve the given double integral [int_0^1 int_y^{sqrt{2 - y^2}} sqrt{x^2 + y^2} , dx , dy,] it's beneficial to switch to polar coordinates, which will make the integral easier to evaluate since we're integrating a function involving (sqrt{x^2 + y^2}), which reminds us of the expression for the distance from the origin in the Cartesian plane. To perform this transformation, we use the following substitutions: [x = rcos(theta),] [y = rsin(theta),] [dx , dy = r , dr , dtheta,] where (r) is the distance from the origin and (theta) is the angle with respect to the positive x-axis. The double integral now transforms into polar coordinates: [int int sqrt{r^2} r , dr , dtheta] The bounds for (r) and (theta) need to be determined from the original Cartesian bounds. Since the original integral is over the region between (y = x) and (x = sqrt{2 - y^2}), we need to examine how this region looks in the xy-plane: - The curve (y = x) in polar coordinates translates to (theta = frac{pi}{4}), since along this line, the (y) coordinate is equal to the (x) coordinate. - The curve (x = sqrt{2 - y^2}) is part of a circle with radius (sqrt{2}) centered at the origin. In polar coordinates, this is simply the circle (r = sqrt{2}) for the second quadrant. The integral's limits for (r) then range from the lower boundary, which is on the line (y = x), to the upper boundary of the circle (x^2 + y^2 = 2). In polar coordinates, the lower boundary is where (rsin(theta) = rcos(theta)), i.e., where (theta = frac{pi}{4}), and the upper boundary is where (r = sqrt{2}). The integral becomes [int_0^{frac{pi}{4}} int_{rsin(theta)}^{sqrt{2}} r^2 , dr , dtheta.] As for (r), the limits of integration change because: - When (y = 0), (r) starts at 0. - When (y = 1), (r) ends at (sqrt{2 - y^2} = sqrt{2 - (sin(theta))^2}), where (theta = frac{pi}{4}) and (r = 1). Thus, the range for (r) becomes (r in [0, 1]) with (theta = frac{pi}{4}). The new double integral is [int_0^{frac{pi}{4}} int_0^1 r^2 , dr , dtheta.] Now, we can solve the integral with respect to (r) first: [int_0^{frac{pi}{4}} left( int_0^1 r^2 , dr right) dtheta = int_0^{frac{pi}{4}} left[ frac{1}{3}r^3 right]_0^1 , dtheta.] Evaluating the inner integral from 0 to 1 gives us: [int_0^{frac{pi}{4}} frac{1}{3} dtheta.] Finally, we integrate with respect to (theta): [int_0^{frac{pi}{4}} frac{1}{3} dtheta = frac{1}{3}theta Big|_0^{frac{pi}{4}} = frac{1}{3} left( frac{pi}{4} - 0 right) = frac{pi}{12}.] The final answer to the double integral is (frac{pi}{12})."},{"instruction":"(c) Optimize f(x)=sqrt(6-x^(2)-y^(2)) using the constraint x+y-2=0.","output":"To optimize the function ( f(x) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - y^2} ) subject to the constraint ( x + y - 2 = 0 ), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. This method involves finding the stationary points of the Lagrange function, which is the original function with the addition of the constraint multiplied by a Lagrange multiplier (lambda). First, rewrite the constraint in the form (g(x, y) = x + y - 2 = 0). Now, define the Lagrange function (L) as: [ L(x, y, lambda) = f(x) - lambda g(x, y) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - y^2} - lambda(x + y - 2) ] To find the stationary points of (L), we take the partial derivatives with respect to (x), (y), and (lambda), and set them equal to 0. [ frac{partial L}{partial x} = frac{-x}{sqrt{6 - x^2 - y^2}} - lambda = 0 ] [ frac{partial L}{partial y} = frac{-y}{sqrt{6 - x^2 - y^2}} - lambda = 0 ] [ frac{partial L}{partial lambda} = x + y - 2 = 0 ] From the first two partials, we have: [ -x = lambda sqrt{6 - x^2 - y^2} ] [ -y = lambda sqrt{6 - x^2 - y^2} ] Dividing these two equations, we get: [ frac{x}{y} = frac{-x}{-y} = 1 ] So ( x = y ). Substituting this into the constraint equation: [ x + x - 2 = 0 ] [ 2x - 2 = 0 ] [ x = 1 ] And since we know ( x = y ), we also have: [ y = 1 ] Substitute these values into the original function ( f(x) ) to find the optimal value: [ f(1) = sqrt{6 - 1^2 - 1^2} = sqrt{6 - 1 - 1} = sqrt{4} = 2 ] Therefore, the maximum value of the function ( f(x) ) subject to the constraint ( x + y - 2 = 0 ) is (2), and this occurs at the point ( (x, y) = (1, 1) )."},{"instruction":"(c) Optimize f(x)=sqrt(6-x^(2)-y^(2)) using the constraint x+y-2=0","output":"To optimize the function ( f(x, y) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - y^2} ) subject to the constraint ( x + y - 2 = 0 ), you can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but a simple substitution method may be more straightforward due to the single constraint. First, let's solve the constraint for one of the variables. Since the constraint is ( x + y - 2 = 0 ), we can solve for (y): [ y = 2 - x ] Now, substitute this expression for (y) into the function (f(x, y)): [ f(x, y) = f(x, 2 - x) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - (2 - x)^2} ] [ f(x, 2 - x) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - (4 - 4x + x^2)} ] [ f(x, 2 - x) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - 4 + 4x - x^2} ] [ f(x, 2 - x) = sqrt{2 + 4x - 2x^2} ] [ f(x, 2 - x) = sqrt{2(1 + 2x - x^2)} ] [ f(x, 2 - x) = sqrt{2 - (x^2 - 2x + 1)} ] [ f(x, 2 - x) = sqrt{2 - (x - 1)^2} ] To optimize ( f ), we take the derivative of the function with respect to (x) and set it to zero to find critical points: [ frac{d}{dx}(sqrt{2 - (x - 1)^2}) = 0 ] [ frac{d}{dx}(2 - (x - 1)^2)^{1/2} = 0 ] Differentiate using the chain rule: [ frac{1}{2}(2 - (x - 1)^2)^{-1/2} cdot -2(x - 1) = 0 ] [ -(x - 1)(2 - (x - 1)^2)^{-1/2} = 0 ] The derivative equals zero when ( (x - 1) = 0 ), so ( x = 1 ). Since ( y = 2 - x ), substituting ( x = 1 ) gives ( y = 1 ). Hence, the point that optimizes ( f ) with respect to the constraint is ( (1, 1) ). Substitute these values back into ( f ) to find the optimized value: [ f(1, 1) = sqrt{6 - 1^2 - 1^2} ] [ f(1, 1) = sqrt{6 - 1 - 1} ] [ f(1, 1) = sqrt{4} ] [ f(1, 1) = 2 ] Thus, the function ( f(x, y) ) is optimized at the point ( (1, 1) ), where it takes a maximum value of (2), since it is limited to the non-negative real numbers (as it is the square root of a real number) and so cannot take on negative values."},{"instruction":"(c) Optimize f(x)=sqrt(6-x^(2)-y^(2)) using the constraint x+y-2=0.","output":"To optimize the function ( f(x,y) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - y^2} ) with the constraint ( x + y - 2 = 0 ), we'll first express one variable in terms of the other using the constraint, and then substitute it back into the function. From the constraint ( x + y - 2 = 0 ), we can solve for ( y ): [ y = 2 - x ] Now substitute for ( y ) in the function ( f(x,y) ): [ f(x, 2-x) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - (2 - x)^2} ] [ f(x) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - (4 - 4x + x^2)} ] [ f(x) = sqrt{6 - x^2 - 4 + 4x - x^2} ] [ f(x) = sqrt{2 + 4x - 2x^2} ] Now we want to optimize this single-variable function ( f(x) ) over the domain of real numbers that makes the expression inside the square root nonnegative, i.e., ( 2 + 4x - 2x^2 geq 0 ). To find the maximum of ( f(x) ), we would ordinarily take the derivative of ( f(x) ) and set it to zero. However, it is clear from the problem that since we have a square root function and ( 2 + 4x - 2x^2 ) is a concave downwards parabola, the maximum value of ( f(x) ) will occur at the vertex of this parabola. The vertex form of a parabola ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is given by ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). For the quadratic expression ( 2 + 4x - 2x^2 ), the coefficients are ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 4 ), so: [ x = -frac{4}{2(-2)} = -frac{4}{-4} = 1 ] Now substituting ( x = 1 ) into the constraint equation ( y = 2 - x ) gives us ( y = 2 - 1 = 1 ). Now, let's substitute ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 1 ) into the original function ( f(x,y) ): [ f(1, 1) = sqrt{6 - (1)^2 - (1)^2} ] [ f(1, 1) = sqrt{6 - 1 - 1} ] [ f(1, 1) = sqrt{4} ] [ f(1, 1) = 2 ] Therefore, the function ( f(x, y) ) is maximized with the constraint ( x + y - 2 = 0 ) at the point ( (x, y) = (1, 1) ) and the maximum value is ( f(1, 1) = 2 ), which is the largest value that the square root expression can take under the given constraint."},{"instruction":"Dvožilni kabel vsebuje dva kovinska vodnika, ki sta zaradi pla- stične izolacije razmaknjena za 3,0 mm.

Cependant, il y a quelques erreurs et points d'amélioration que vous pouvez corriger pour que le polymorphisme fonctionne correctement. Voici quelques points à corriger ou à améliorer : 1. Typo dans \`__mpaer_args__\` : dans la classe \`QuestionMultiple\`, vous avez écrit \`__mpaer_args__\` au lieu de \`__mapper_args__\`. 2. \`QuestionMultiple\` et \`SimpleQuestion\` doivent override la méthode \`to_json()\` si elles ont des comportements supplémentaires ou différents par rapport à ce que fait \`Question.to_json()\`. Sinon, elles vont hériter du comportement implémenté dans \`Question.to_json()\`, ce qui pourrait être suffisant si pas de différences. 3. Vérification de l'existence de l'objet avant modification ou suppression : dans les méthodes \`create_question\`, \`update_question\`, et \`delete_question\`, lorsque vous vérifiez si une question existe (\`q = Question.query.get(question_id)\`), vous utilisez \`abort(404)\` si \`q\` est \`None\`.

Ajout de réponse à \`to_json()\`: dans \`Question.to_json()\`, vous devriez probablement inclure \`reponse\` à chaque fois que vous construisez le dictionnaire JSON pour assurer la cohérence avec ce qui est attendu dans le code client. 5. Utilisez \`serialize()\` au lieu de \`to_json()\`: il peut être plus clair de nommer la méthode de conversion en JSON \`serialize()\` car \`to_json()\` peut donner l'impression qu'elle renvoie une chaîne JSON directement, pas un dictionnaire Python qui peut ensuite être converti en JSON. 6.

The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as: Attention(Q,K, V ) = softmax( QKT √ dk )V (1) The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of √1 dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by √1 dk\\"","output":"El texto describe un enfoque específico de la función de atención llamado \\"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\". La función de atención se utiliza en modelos de procesamiento del lenguaje natural como las redes neuronales para ponderar la influencia de diferentes partes de los datos de entrada al modelar una cierta pieza de información. Cuando se utiliza esta función de atención, la entrada consiste en vectores llamados \\"queries\\" y \\"keys\\", los cuales tienen la misma dimensión (dk), y vectores llamados \\"values\\" con dimensión (dv). El proceso consiste en calcular el producto escalar (dot product) entre el vector de consultas (query) y todos los vectores de claves (keys), dividir cada producto escalar por la raíz cuadrada de dk, y luego aplicar una función softmax para obtener los pesos de los vectores de valores (values). Esta atención se calcula para un conjunto de consultas al mismo tiempo, y las consultas, claves y valores se organizan en matrices Q, K y V respectivamente. La salida se calcula usando la fórmula: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((QK^T) / sqrt(dk))V Esta fórmula muestra cómo se multiplica la matriz de consultas Q con la transpuesta de la matriz de claves K, se escala el resultado, y luego se aplica softmax antes de multiplicar por la matriz de valores V. El texto además compara dos funciones de atención comúnmente usadas: la atención aditiva y la atención de producto escalar (dot-product attention). La atención de producto escalar es similar al enfoque descrito, pero la atención aditiva utiliza una red neuronal con una sola capa oculta para calcular las compatibilidades. En la práctica, la atención de producto escalar suele ser más rápida y eficiente en términos de memoria que la atención aditiva, gracias a la optimización de las operaciones de multiplicación de matrices. Sin embargo, se señala que cuando dk es grande, la atención aditiva puede superar al enfoque de producto escalar sin escalar porque los productos escalares pueden volverse muy grandes, haciendo que la función softmax opere en una región con gradientes muy pequeños, lo cual puede ser problemático para el aprendizaje. Por esta razón, se escala el producto escalar por 1/sqrt(dk) para mitigar este efecto y hacer que la función de atención funcione mejor con valores grandes de dk."},{"instruction":"Puedes explicarme en qué consisten los dos enfoques de la función atención: scaled dot.product attention y Multi-head Attention?","output":"Claro, te explicaré ambos conceptos de manera sencilla: # Scaled Dot-Product Attention El mecanismo de \\"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\" es una técnica utilizada principalmente en el modelo Transformer, el cual es popular en tareas de procesamiento del lenguaje natural. Este enfoque de atención se calcula siguiendo estos pasos: 1. **Puntuación**: Se calculan los productos escalares entre los vectores de consulta \\"queries\\" y las claves \\"keys\\". Esto da como resultado una puntuación de atención para cada par de consulta y clave, y estas puntuaciones indican qué tan bien se alinean o se relacionan entre sí. 2. **Escala**: Se escalan las puntuaciones dividiéndolas por la raíz cuadrada de la dimensión de las claves (sqrt(dk)). Esta escala ayuda a evitar gradientes muy pequeños en la función softmax, que se aplicará posteriormente, especialmente cuando la dimensión es alta. 3. **Softmax**: Se aplica la función softmax para normalizar las puntuaciones. Esto convierte las puntuaciones en probabilidades que suman 1, permitiendo que el modelo decida cuánta importancia (peso) asignar a cada valor. 4. **Ponderación**: Los vectores de valor \\"values\\" se ponderan por estas probabilidades normalizadas, lo que significa que cuanto mayor sea la probabilidad asociada a una clave, más influencia tendrá su valor correspondiente. # Multi-Head Attention La atención multi-cabeza o \\"Multi-Head Attention\\" es una extensión del mecanismo de \\"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\" que permite que el modelo preste atención a la información desde diferentes representaciones en posiciones distintas. He aquí cómo funciona: 1. **Varias Cabezas**: Se crean 'h' cabezas de atención distintas, donde cada cabeza tiene su propio conjunto de matrices de pesos aprendidas (para consultas, claves y valores). Esto se hace para que cada cabeza pueda aprender a atender a diferentes partes de la secuencia de entrada de forma independiente. 2. **Procesamiento en Paralelo**: Cada una de estas cabezas realiza el proceso de atención (como se explicó en el \\"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\") de manera independiente y en paralelo. 3. **Concatenación**: Una vez que cada cabeza ha procesado la información, las salidas de todas las cabezas se concatenan para formar una sola matriz de salida. 4. **Proyección Final**: La matriz de salida concatenada se multiplica luego por otra matriz de pesos aprendida (proyección lineal) para combinar la información de todas las cabezas de atención en una sola representación. La principal ventaja de la atención multi-cabeza es que permite que el modelo capture varias relaciones o patrones en la secuencia de entrada de manera simultánea. Por ejemplo, puede atender simultáneamente a diferentes posiciones de una sentencia y capturar relaciones semánticas y sintácticas complejas. Ambos mecanismos son fundamentales en el modelo Transformer y han sido piedra angular en avances recientes en tareas de procesamiento de lenguaje natural, como la traducción automática, el resumen de texto y la generación de texto."},{"instruction":"En IA, qué es y como funciona la función de compatibilidad dentro de los mecanismos de atención?","output":"En el contexto de la Inteligencia Artificial, específicamente en el campo del aprendizaje profundo y los modelos secuenciales como las Redes Neuronales Recurrentes (RNN) y las Redes Neuronales con Mecanismo de Atención, la función de compatibilidad es una parte crucial del mecanismo de atención. El mecanismo de atención fue introducido para mejorar la capacidad de los modelos secuenciales de recordar y enfocarse en partes relevantes de la entrada al producir una salida. Es particularmente útil en tareas de procesamiento de lenguaje natural como la traducción automática, donde se debe prestar atención a diferentes partes de la entrada para generar cada palabra de la salida. La función de compatibilidad, también conocida como función de puntuación o scoring function, calcula qué tan relevante es cada parte de la entrada para una determinada parte de la salida. En otras palabras, mide la compatibilidad entre el estado oculto actual de la red (que representa lo que se está generando en el momento) y cada uno de los estados ocultos anteriores (que representan la entrada). Funciona de la siguiente manera: 1. **Estados Ocultos de Entrada**: La RNN procesa la secuencia de entrada, generando una serie de estados ocultos que representan diferentes momentos de la secuencia. 2. **Estado Oculto de Salida**: Mientras se genera la secuencia de salida, para cada nuevo elemento que se va a producir, se tiene un estado oculto actual que resume toda la información generada hasta ese momento. 3. **Cálculo de la Puntuación**: La función de compatibilidad toma el estado oculto de salida y lo compara con cada uno de los estados ocultos de entrada usando alguna operación matemática. Las más comunes incluyen: - Producto punto (dot): \`score(s_t, h_i) = s_t^T * h_i\` - Producto basado en coseno: \`score(s_t, h_i) = cos(s_t, h_i)\` - Multiplicativo (general): \`score(s_t, h_i) = s_t^T * W * h_i\` - Aditivo (concatenativo): \`score(s_t, h_i) = v_a^T * tanh(W_1 * s_t + W_2 * h_i)\` Donde \`s_t\` es el estado oculto actual de salida, \`h_i\` son los estados ocultos de entrada, \`W\`, \`W_1\` y \`W_2\` son matrices de pesos aprendibles, y \`v_a\` es un vector de pesos. Cada fórmula es una forma diferente de calcular la compatibilidad entre los estados. 4. **Pesos de Atención**: Las puntuaciones calculadas se pasan a través de una función softmax para obtener un conjunto de pesos de atención normalizados que suman 1. Estos pesos determinan la importancia relativa de cada estado oculto de entrada para la generación del actual ítem en la secuencia de salida. 5. **Contexto**: Los pesos de atención se aplican a los estados ocultos de la entrada para producir un vector de contexto. Este vector de contexto es una suma ponderada de los estados ocultos de entrada y captura la información relevante a la que se debe prestar atención. 6. **Generación de Salida**: El vector de contexto se combina con el estado oculto de salida para influir en la generación del próximo elemento de la secuencia de salida. Esto puede implicar alimentar el vector de contexto a otra RNN o usarlo para calcular la probabilidad de la siguiente palabra en una secuencia de lenguaje natural. La idea detrás de todo esto es permitir al modelo aprender a distribuir su \\"atención\\" de manera efectiva para mejorar la calidad de las predicciones o generaciones basadas en secuencias de entrada largas o complejas."},{"instruction":"I'm working on a manga and I'd like to tell you about its main premise.","output":"That sounds exciting!

It's about a brother and a sister running away from home because their parents' marriage is falling apart. It's summer and the story takes places over 3 months, June, July and August.","output":"That's a compelling and emotionally resonant premise, as it deals with themes that are quite universal: family, conflict, and the quest for solace in the face of domestic turmoil. Here are a few thoughts and elements you might want to consider in developing your manga: **Setting & Atmosphere**: Choose settings that reflect the emotional journey of the siblings. Summer can symbolize freedom, growth, and change, and different locations they visit can mirror their internal states. **Character Development**: Explore the depth of your characters by showing how the siblings cope with their family situation differently. This could be an opportunity to delve into their individual personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and how their relationship evolves over the three months. **Time Progression**: Use the three months to segment the story arc. June could be the initial escape and the thrill of newfound freedom, July can bring the reality of their situation and inherent challenges, and August could be when the consequences of their decision fully unfold, leading to a climax and resolution. **Themes**: Engage with themes like the innocence of youth amidst adult problems, the meaning of home and family, resilience through adversity, and the quest for identity separate from their family background. **Visual Style**: As it's a manga, the visual style will play a crucial role in telling your story. Expressive character designs, the use of light and shadow, and panel layout can all convey the mood you want to evoke - whether it's whimsy, sadness, or tension. **Supporting Cast**: Introduce characters they might encounter during their runaway who either help or hinder their journey. These interactions can help the siblings learn valuable life lessons and influence their perspective on their situation. **Resolution**: Decide how you want the story to conclude—whether it's a return home with a newfound understanding, finding a new place where they feel they belong, or leaving their resolution open-ended for readers to interpret. Remember that similar stories about family issues can be quite sensitive for some readers, and handling the subject matter with care will make the manga not only relatable but also respectful of the weight of the real-life issues it represents. Your manga has the potential to combine an engaging narrative with emotional depth. Good luck with your project, and if you have any particular questions or need more detailed assistance, feel free to ask!"},{"instruction":"They live in Seattle and their destination is their grandparents' place in Miami. Their journey is via a motorcycle, a red 1992 Harley Davidson Fat Boy with a flame livery. They decide to stop by Nevada and Arizona to see some interesting places.","output":"This additional information adds a road-trip element to your story, allowing for a wide range of encounters and experiences that can enhance the narrative. Given that the siblings are traveling from Seattle to Miami, there is a substantial distance to cover with diverse geographical and cultural landscapes. Here are some elements you can explore: **Travel Challenges**: Consider the practicalities and challenges of a long-distance road trip, especially on a motorcycle. This includes weather conditions, fatigue, and the logistics of food and lodging. The siblings will need to navigate these obstacles, which contributes to their growth and development. **Character Dynamics**: The close quarters of a motorcycle road trip will force the siblings to interact closely, which can either strengthen their relationship or lead to tension and conflict, especially given the emotional backdrop of their parents' failing marriage. **Iconic Landmarks**: As they venture through Nevada and Arizona, you can weave in famous landmarks they might visit. For example, in Nevada, they could experience the grandeur of the Las Vegas Strip or the stark beauty of the desert. In Arizona, there are natural wonders like the Grand Canyon, which could serve as a metaphor for the depth and complexity of their family situation. **Cultural Encounters**: Along the way, the siblings will encounter a variety of people from different walks of life. Each character they meet can impart some wisdom or challenge their preconceptions, helping them reflect on their own situation. **Visual Distinction**: Each state has its own unique aesthetic, so visually distinguish these settings within your art. Portray the lush greenery of Washington, the vast deserts of Nevada, and the red rocks of Arizona in ways that enhance the story's atmosphere and setting. **Grandparents' Role**: The grandparents’ home in Miami might represent a place of solace or an end goal where the siblings believe they can find peace or answers. It's worth considering what the relationship with their grandparents is like and how this shapes their expectations of the journey’s end. **Motorcycle as a Symbol**: The red 1992 Harley Davidson Fat Boy with flame livery itself can symbolize the journey, freedom, and the siblings' shared bond. It's an unconventional choice for such a long trip, especially for young characters, which could reflect their rebellious or adventurous spirits. **Historical and Geographic Education**: As the characters take in the sights, introduce the reader to various historical and cultural contexts of the locations they're traveling through. This not only adds depth to the journey but can also be educational. **Internal Reflection**: Use quieter moments in the journey, like long stretches of road or nights under the stars, as opportunities for the siblings to reflect on their life and the nature of the relationships within their family. Remember that pacing is crucial for such a story. Balancing high-stakes moments with periods of introspection ensures that the readers remain engaged and invested in the characters' journey, both externally and internally. As always, it's critical to research the places and cultures you're representing to portray them accurately and respectfully in your manga."},{"instruction":"They brought a weeks' worth of snacks and drinks, the rest is either bought from random stores or having a nice dinner at a random diner in the middle of nowhere. Money is not worth of the issue, because the older sister brought a tin can filled with around 2000 dollars. The 2000 dollars was from the money she used to buy her Harley, around 4000 bucks.","output":"That's a good setup to provide the siblings with some means to sustain themselves during their trip, which makes their adventure more plausible and alleviates some immediate tension in terms of basic survival. Having a budget does, however, introduce other considerations for the story: **Budgeting**: Though 2,000 is a significant amount, it still requires budgeting, especially over the duration of a potentially weeks- or months-long trip. Their financial decisions could create conflict or serve as learning moments, especially if unexpected expenses arise. **Sibling Dynamics**: Money management might bring out different values or priorities in the siblings. Perhaps one is more frugal and the other more carefree, providing conflict and opportunities for character development within their relationship. **Bonding Experiences**: Stopping at small, local diners and stores could lead to memorable interactions with locals, creating a richer tapestry for your narrative. These are chances for the siblings to learn from the people they meet and for you, as the author, to introduce a variety of secondary characters. **Consequences of Spending**: As they watch their funds dwindle, this could add tension and urgency to their journey. The siblings might need to make choices about what they can afford to do or not do, which could also result in personal sacrifices that test their bond. **Opportunities for Side Jobs**: If they find they're running low on funds, you have the opportunity to introduce short-term jobs or tasks they could do to earn more money. This could also enhance the realism and relatability of the story, as well as give them a chance to learn new skills or work ethics. **Learning Experiences**: The older sister's decision to use half of her Harley fund shows dedication to their cause. There could be flashbacks or conversations about how she saved that money, teaching lessons about hard work and sacrifice. **Symbolic Value of the Tin Can**: The tin can filled with cash can serve as a tangible symbol of the older sister's dreams and plans, which she has redirected toward their current escape. Its contents become a measure of their progress and a reminder of what's at stake. **Resourcefulness**: The story can demonstrate their resourcefulness as they figure out how to make the money last, like looking for deals, coupons, or cheap accommodations, which could be a fun aspect for readers to follow. By giving the siblings a limited fund to work with, you create tension and stakes that will keep readers invested in their journey. The emphasis on their financial status can also serve as a subtle reminder of the socio-economic realities many young people face. It will be key to balance these financial aspects with the emotional narrative to maintain a coherent and engaging storyline."},{"instruction":"Our two main siblings are Elena and David. Elena is 19 and went to community college. David is 14 and just finished 6th grade. There are mentions of a 3rd sibling but the only thing known about him is that he works as a seaplane pilot.","output":"Creating a dynamic between two siblings with a significant age gap and the hint of a third, more enigmatic sibling can provide a fertile ground for exploring different family relationships and the complexities that come with them. Here’s how you might integrate Elena, David, and the mysterious third sibling into your story: **Elena, the Protector**: Elena at 19, having some college experience, would likely carry the weight of responsibility for her younger brother. Taking on the role of the caretaker could place her in situations where she must balance her own needs and desires with those of protecting and guiding David. **David, the Innocent**: At 14 and just out of 6th grade, David would be in the throes of early adolescence, a time of personal upheaval and identity formation. His perspective on the family's situation and the ensuing adventure could be more innocent or idealistic compared to his older sister's. **Bonding and Conflict**: A cross-country road trip will force Elena and David to rely on each other, strengthening their bond. However, their different stages in life could also lead to disagreements and conflicts, further exacerbated by the stress of their family's situation. **The Third Sibling**: Mentioning a third sibling who is a seaplane pilot adds depth to the family dynamic without him being present. This sibling could represent what Elena and David aspire to be or the freedom they wish they had. He could also emerge as a character later in the story, offering support or adding complexity to their journey. **Backstories and Development**: Each sibling can have flashbacks to meaningful moments that shaped them, giving the reader insight into their histories and motivations. Elena’s community college experience, for instance, might have provided her with practical skills or knowledge that can help them on their journey. **Individual Struggles and Growth**: Elena and David will each face their personal struggles throughout the story. Elena may grapple with the sacrifice of her savings and her plans, while David might deal with the transition from child to teenager in the context of a disrupted family life. **Influence of the Absent Sibling**: Whether or not the third sibling makes a physical appearance in the manga, his presence can be felt through the choices and reflections of Elena and David. Perhaps they are inspired by his independence or feel abandoned by his absence. **Family Perspective**: Through the different viewpoints and experiences of the siblings, the manga can provide a wider commentary on how each family member responds to and processes the circumstances surrounding their parents' marriage problems.

ОБЩИЕ ПОЛОЖЕНИЯ О РАССЛЕДОВАНИИ ПО УГОЛОВНЫМ ДЕЛАМ В ОТНОШЕНИИ НЕСОВЕРШЕННОЛЕТНИХ 1.1 Понятие и история привлечения к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних в российском законодательстве роль несовершеннолетних в уголовном судопроизводстве Согласно статье 87 УК РФ [3], несовершеннолетними признаются лица, которые ко времени совершения преступления исполнилось 14, но не испол-нилось 18 лет. Преступления, совершаемые лицами, не достигшими совершеннолетия, представляют собой сегмент общей преступности, подвергающийся влиянию социальных, экономических и психологических факторов, как и преступность взрослых. У такой категории правонарушений есть отличия: они характеризу-ются причинами, свойственными динамике развития и особенностям лично¬сти несовершеннолетних преступников. Анализ истории уголовного законодательства в части ответственности несовершеннолетних демонстрирует, что вопрос об устанавливаемом возрасте уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних и наказания для их был раз¬решен по-разному в разные исторические периоды. С древнерусского времени несовершеннолетние несли наказание наравне со взрослыми. Однако изменения начались в 1669 году с принятия Но¬воуказных статей [33], в которых впервые установлены возрастные ограниче¬ния. В воинском Артикле [32] от 1715 года были определены рамки ответ¬ственности за преступления, связанные с кражами, но вопрос о том, кто счи¬тается \\"младенцем\\", оставался неясным. Сенатский указ [31] уже конкретизи¬ровал, что лица до 12 лет не подлежат казни, а вместо этого применяются ис¬правительные меры. Изучив законодательные акты, начиная с собрания уло¬жения от 1649 года и заканчивая Сенатским указом, можно выделить тенден¬цию к гуманизации. Видно стремление не наказывать несовершеннолетних, а направлять их на путь исправления. По словам Г. С. Працко, законодательство подчеркивало, что дети до совершеннолетия могут быть исправлены альтер¬нативными методами, не прибегая к каторге или заключению в тюремное учреждение, ведь подобные меры предназначены для злостных преступников. Общение несовершеннолетних с такими лицами могло иметь отрицательное воздействие [21, с. 318]. Мы разделяем мнение с Г.С. Працко, так как более строгое наказание несовершеннолетнего может негативно на нем отразится и склонить его к совершению преступлений в дальнейшем, потому что обычно каторга и тюремное заключение применялась к злостным нарушителям за¬кона, а как мы знаем разделение по возрасту в тюрьмах не было соответ¬ственно взрослые преступники находились вместе с несовершеннолетними, а мы прекрасно знаем, что дети очень сильно подвержены влиянию взрослых. С началом появления Уложения о наказаниях и уголовных исправитель-ных мерах от 1845 года начались изменения в классификации подросткового возраста. Например, для категории лиц от 7 до 10 лет определенные виды нака¬зания были отменены, и вместо этого нарушителей передавали родителям [20, с. 133]. Спустя 65 лет в России впервые появился суд по делам несовершенно¬летних. Рассмотрев Уложение о наказаниях и уголовных исправительных ме¬рах от 1845 года, можно сделать вывод что наказания были не гуманны по от¬ношению к детям и были не эффективны так как это обусловлено тем, что под¬ростки в связи со своим возрастом не понимали последствия своего деяния, поэтому и были введены меры по передачи правонарушителей родителям. После Октябрьской революции 1917 года формировались новые прин-ципы в области уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних, обозначено в декретах того времени, как Декрет СНК РСФСР [30]. За этот период времени была отменена тюремная система для подростков, в этот же период времени начали вводить альтернативные формы воздействия в отношении молодых преступников также вводились комиссии и медицинское освидетельствова¬ние. Проанализировав Декрет СНК РСФРС можно сделать вывод что по окон¬чанию революции были применимы щадящие меры наказания несовершенно¬летних, начали учитывать психические особенности подростков что позволяло изменить форму наказания на медицинское учреждение. Исходя из этого при¬ходим к выводу, что наказания были заменены на спецшколы и интернаты, где непосредственно перевоспитывались малолетние преступники. Статья 13 «Руководящих начал» РСФСР 1919 г. говорит, что до 14 лет несовершенно¬летние не подлежат суду и наказанию, применяются воспитательные меры. Также к лицам от 14 до 18 лет, «действующим без разумения». Если они «дей¬ствуют с разумением», то возможны меры уголовного наказания. Декрет СНК РСФСР 1920 г. упразднял суды и тюремное заключение для несовершеннолет¬них, устанавливал возраст уголовной ответственности с 14 до 18 лет. Дела о преступлениях несовершеннолетних ведут комиссии о несовершеннолетних [24]. По новому Декрету 1920 г. была издана Инструкция комиссиям по делам о несовершеннолетних [29]. Проанализировав изменение за 1920 год, можно прийти к выводу, что ювенальные законы стали походить на современные, та-кое как возраст уголовной ответственности и меры наказания, но продлилось это до 1922 года, что в последствии приведет к новым вопросам. В связи с изменяем возраста уголовной ответственности в Уголовном кодексе РСФРС [28] 1922 году, в 1923 году были внесены изменение в УПК РСФРС [27] в котором были внесены изменение в ст. 38 статусы «малолетние» до 14 лет, и «несовершеннолетние» с 14 до 16 лет. В УК РСФРС 1926 года [26], в ст. 12 был установлен возраст уголовной ответственности с 14 лет, эти правила действовали до 1935г., хотя в союзных республиках возраст уголов¬ной ответственности остался без изменений [7]. К лицам моложе 14 этого воз¬раста меры социальной защиты не применялись. Несовершеннолетние от 14 до 16 несли ответственность только в определенных случаях, и в случаях если на этом настаивала комиссия по делам несовершеннолетним. В первоначальной редакции Уголовного кодекса субъектом преступления являлось лицо совершившее деяние в возрасте 14 лет. Постановлением ВЦИК и СНК РСФСР 1929 г. возраст уголовной ответственности был повышен с 14 до 16 лет. Можно сделать вывод что за 1923-1929 годы, особых изменений в уголовном кодексе и уголовно-процессуальном кодексе не было, но эти изменения не коснулись союзных республик. В советский период уголовное законодательство претерпело колоссальные изменения это связанно со сменной власти и переходом от монархической формы правления к советской. Ключевыми моментами были установление в 1935 году до 1958 года возраста уголовной ответственности в 12 лет и применение ко всем возрастным категориям несовершеннолетних полного спектра наказаний, используемых для взрослых. Установлено что, решение было продиктовано социальными проблемами, увеличением уровня преступности среди молодежи и военным временем. В 1958 году закреплено правило об установлении уголовной ответственности начиная с 16-летнего возраста, отказывая в ней детям и подросткам младше этого возраста. В 1960 году в новом Уголовном кодексе РСФРС [4] была установлена цель не наказать, а перевоспитать несовершеннолетнего. Согласно новому положению, уголовная ответственность начиналась с 14 лет, а полная ответственность – с 16 лет. В рамках этого изменения предусматривалось освобождение от уголовной ответственности, учитывая систему оценки деяний несовершеннолетних и обращая внимание на умственное развитие и зрелость подростка. В Уголовно-процессуальном кодексе РСФСР [4] 1960 года расширен предмет доказывания по уголовным делам несовершеннолетних, а также усилена роль защитника и законных представителей несовершеннолетних в судебных процессах. В 1960 году Уголовный кодекс РСФСР [4] ввел концепцию принудительных мер воспитательного характера, свидетельствуя о шаге к исправлению и социальной адаптации. Включение воспитательного момента и акцент на социализацию связаны с мировыми тенденциями в правах ребенка, где приоритетом является восстановительная справедливость и забота о будущем подрастающего поколения. В 1960-х годах была проделана большая работа по защите прав несовершеннолетних, таких как защита, социальная адаптация, работа с педагогами. Ретроспективный анализ уголовного законодательства показывает эволюцию к более гуманному и дифференцированному подходу к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних. От жесткого наказания к мерам, ориентированным на исправление и социальную адаптацию, уголовный кодекс претерпел изменения, отражающие дух времени и общественные настроения, стремясь найти справедливый баланс между защитой общества и правами молодого поколения. Стремление к гуманизации уголовного права привело к появлению Уголовного кодекса РФ 1996 года, акцентирующего внимание на социальной реабилитации несовершеннолетних преступников. Закон подчеркивает, что важным аспектом наказания является индивидуальный подход к каждому лицу, и выступает против стигматизации и изоляции подростков от общества, так как последнее может привести к более худшему исходу событий. Вводятся понятия делинквентной поведенческой реакции, социально-педагогической и психолого-медицинской диагностики, а также различные воспитательные программы. В итоге, динамика развития уголовного законодательства в отношении несовершеннолетних на протяжении веков свидетельствует о пути от строгих санкций к системам, фокусирующим внимание на профилактику преступлений и реинтеграцию в общество. Отражая изменения социальных настроений и юридических парадигм, современные нормы подтверждают важность индивидуализации подходов в вопросах делинквентного поведения подростков и подчеркивают необходимость создания условий для их полноценного развития и социальной адаптации. 1.2 Особенности производства по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних Производство по делам несовершеннолетним состоит из двух основных этапов: возбуждение уголовного дела и предварительное расследование. При этом важно установить наличие или отсутствие взрослого соучастника еще на стадии возбуждения уголовного дела. Если невозможно исключить участие взрослого соучастника, то дело все равно должно быть возбуждено, и на стадии предварительного расследования проводится проверка по данной версии [9]. В уголовных делах о несовершеннолетних доказываются следующие обстоятельства в соответствии с УПК РФ ст. 73 и 421: Возраст несовершеннолетнего, точная дата рождения; Жизненные условия, воспитание, личностные особенности, уровень психического развития; Влияние на несовершеннолетнего со стороны взрослых; При умственной отсталости, не связанной с психическим расстройством, способность понимать и контролировать свои действия и бездействия; При совершении преступлений средней тяжести и выше, исключая случаи из ст. 92 УК РФ [3], наличие либо отсутствие заболеваний, мешающих нахождению в спецучреждении. [10] Эти факты выясняются через допрос родителей, учителей и других информированных лиц, изучение документов и проведение следственных либо судебных процедур. Лицо достигает возраста уголовной ответственности на день после своего дня рождения, и, если документ, подтверждающий возраст, отсутствует, назначается судебно-медицинская экспертиза. В случае ее проведения дата, указанная как год рождения, признается днем рождения подозреваемого или обвиняемого. Входе предварительного расследования может возникнуть необходимость в установлении точного возраста в этом случае следователь или дознаватель может вынести решение о назначении медицинского освидетельствования, в соответствии с требованиями Правительства РФ. [11] Делается вывод о том, что для уголовного дела критично установить ключевые аспекты: факт преступления, вину, виновное поведение, мотивацию, условия, влияющие на юридическую ответственность, исключения из-за отсутствия преступных действий, основания для освобождения от ответственности, ущерб и предшествующие факторы преступления. В уголовном процессе по делам несовершеннолетних подозреваемый или обвиняемый должен иметь как защитника, так и законного представителя. По УПК РФ статье 51 [2], участие защитника является обязательным для несовершеннолетних, и следователи обязаны гарантировать его присутствие в процессе, даже если несовершеннолетний этого не хочет, как указано в части 2 статьи 52 УПК РФ. Несоблюдение этого требования считается серьезным нарушением прав несовершеннолетнего на защиту и является существенным нарушением уголовно-процессуального закона (в соответствии с пунктом 4 части 2 статьи 381 УПК РФ). При рассмотрении дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними, вопрос о приглашении защитника, как правило, решается через законного представителя несовершеннолетнего [12]. Участие законного представителя в деле является обязательным не только на стадии предварительного расследования, но и на последующих судебных этапах. К представителям относятся родители, усыновители, опекуны, или попечители несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого либо потерпевшего, а также представители учреждений или организаций, на попечении которых находится подозреваемый, в соответствии с пунктом 12 статьи 5 УПК РФ. Правовой статус законного представителя на стадии предварительного расследования определен статьей 426 УПК РФ [2]. Мы приходим к выводу, что эффективное участие законного представителя в уголовном процессе с первого допроса подростка является главным элементом, гарантирующим защиту прав и интересов несовершеннолетнего. В законе прописан полный перечень всех прав законных представителей, а также приписываются обязательства в случае нарушении последних возможна замена представителя. Это позволяет гарантировать соблюдение интересов подростков на всех этапах расследования. Гражданский ответчик, являющийся ответственным за несовершеннолетнего в случае совершении им преступного деяния, выступает активной стороной в уголовном процессе. Выступать в качестве гражданского ответчика может не только физическое лицо, но и юридическое согласно Гражданскому кодексу РФ. Привлечение ответчика производится постановлением следователя, дознавателя или судом, решение выносит суд в соответствии со статьей 54 УПК РФ [2]. Уголовное судопроизводство по делам несовершеннолетних предполагает особенности в процедурных действиях, включая вызов несовершеннолетнего. Он осуществляется через его родителей или законных представителей при вызове к следователю, дознавателю или в суд по статье 424 УПК РФ. Если несовершеннолетний находится под стражей, вызов проходит через учреждение его содержания [14]. Допрос несовершеннолетнего также имеет ряд особенностей, которые определены в статье 425 УПК РФ: 1. Допрос несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого не может продолжаться без перерыва более двух часов и в общей сложности не более четырех часов в день. 2. Допрос подозреваемого или обвиняемого несовершеннолетнего осуществляется с участием защитника, последний вправе задавать вопросы и ознакомится с протоколом допроса, а также делать замечание по нему. 3. Лица, не достигшие возраста 16 лет или достигшего этого возраста, но страдающие психическими расстройствами или отстающими в психическом развитии допрашиваются с участием педагога или психолога. 4. Педагог или психолог, вправе с разрешения следователя или дознавателя задавать вопросы несовершеннолетнему подозреваемому, обвиняемому. Знакомится с протоколом допроса и делать письменные замечания. Эти права разъясняются всем участникам допроса и делается отметка в протоколе. На основе выполненного анализа ст. 425 УПК РФ можно утверждать, что данные предписания повышают вероятность более точного расследования преступления путем учета различных особенностей подростков и тем самым обеспечиваются их права. Применение мер принуждения к несовершеннолетним регулируется общими правилами по главам 12 и 13 УПК РФ [2]. Заключение под стражу используется для несовершеннолетних при подозрении в совершении тяжких или особо тяжких преступлений, согласно статье 108 УПК РФ, и в исключительных случаях — для преступлений средней тяжести. Ограничений для задержания по подозрению в преступлении закон не предусматривает [15]. Законный представитель несовершеннолетнего имеет право присутствовать в суде при решении вопроса о заключении его под стражу и получать копию решения об избрании меры пресечения, согласно части 4 статьи 108 и части 2 статьи 101 УПК РФ [2]. Для подростков предусмотрена, такая мера пресечения как передача под надзор родителям или законным представителям, в соответствии со ст. 105 УПК РФ. Эти меры применяются только под письменное согласие что в последствии обеспечивает явку в следственные органы и в суд. В случае несоблюдения этих обязанностей к надзирающим лицам могут быть применены меры взыскания в согласно ч. 4 ст. 103 УПК РФ [17]. Прекращение уголовного дела и преследования происходит по общим нормам, урегулированным статьями 24-28 УПК РФ. Согласно статье 427 УПК РФ, предусмотрена возможность прекращения уголовного преследования несовершеннолетнего на стадии предварительного расследования и применение воспитательных мер влияния, если: несовершеннолетний совершил преступление небольшой или средней тяжести; Есть основания считать, что исправление возможно без применения уголовного наказания; Сам несовершеннолетний и его законный представитель согласны с таким прекращением уголовного преследования. При согласии следователя и прокурора, они выносят постановление о прекращении условного преследования и возбуждении ходатайства о применении принудительных мер воспитательного воздействия перед судом. Судья рассматривает материалы дела и ходатайство в соответствии с требованиями статьи 108 УПК РФ [2]. Если судья соглашается с принятым решением органа предварительного расследования, он применяет к несовершеннолетнему принудительные меры воспитательного воздействия. Контроль за соблюдением этих мер возлагается на специализированный государственный орган, ответственный за исправление несовершеннолетних, по решению суда. Если несовершеннолетний систематически не соблюдает требования, предусмотренные принудительной мерой воспитательного воздействия, судья, по представлению специализированного государственного органа, может отменить принудительную меру и направить материалы прокурору для дальнейшего рассмотрения уголовного дела [19]. Следователь может постановить не допускать несовершеннолетнего к ознакомлению с материалами дела, которые могут оказать на него негативное влияние, ограничив ознакомление только законным представителем. Процесс рассмотрения уголовных дел с участием несовершеннолетних обладает особыми чертами, которые учитывают их возраст, статус и участие вместе с взрослыми лицами. Установленные нормы направлены на то, чтобы обеспечить правильное и эффективное осуществление правосудия в случаях, когда осуждаются или судятся несовершеннолетние. 1.3 Процессуальные гарантии несовершеннолетних, привлекаемых к уголовной ответственности Уголовные процедуры, применяемые к подросткам, отличаются введением дополнительных защитных мер для прав и интересов обвиняемых и подозреваемых молодых людей. Такая система обусловлена необходимостью интеграции международно-признанных принципов судопроизводства в национальный правовой контекст, в том числе в контексте дел, в которых фигурируют несовершеннолетние [13]. Среди основных прав, которые необходимо гарантировать несовершеннолетним, выделяется право на профессиональную юридическую поддержку. Это право превращается в обязанность следователя или дознавателя обеспечивать участие защитника на всех стадиях предварительного расследования дел о несовершеннолетних, как это предусмотрено абзацем 2 части 1 статьи 51 УПК РФ. В научных дебатах обсуждается применимость в качестве защитника не только профессионального адвоката, но и других лиц. Некоторые эксперты решительно против того, чтобы посторонние без юридической квалификации участвовали в процессе, например, в судах мировых судей [18, с. 59]. Есть предложение о создании квалифицированных адвокатов, которые будут акцентироваться только на делах с участием несовершеннолетних [22, с. 26], другие же утверждают, что качество юридической помощи определяется практическими навыками и знаниями лица, а не его профессиональным статусом [23, с. 75]. Представляется целесообразным отметить, что законодатель также расширил права защиты, устанавливая обязанность удовлетворять запросы о включении в материалы дела доказательственных объектов, документов и заключений специалистов, проведенных по инициативе защиты, согласно части 2.2 статьи 159 УПК РФ. Очередной дополнительный элемент защиты прав несовершеннолетнего при уголовном преследовании заключается во включении его законного представителя в процесс. В качестве таковых могут выступать родители, усыновители, опекуны, попечители, а также представители учреждений, занимающихся попечением несовершеннолетних, или органов опеки. Их участие не зависит от их желания участвовать в процессе это их обязанность а обусловлено законом п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ[22, c. 28]. Однако в статья 426, часть 4 УПК РФ есть случае при которых законных представителей можно отстранить к таким случаям относится помеха при осуществлении процессуальных действиях или на стадии судебного разбирательства, в этих случаях законного представителя могут отстранить так как эти помехи нарушают права несовершеннолетнего. При этом в законе на этот случай предусмотрена замена представителя на другое лицо, однако, если сравнить ч. 1 ст. 437 и ст. 48 УПК РФ прослеживаются отличие в перечни лиц, которые могут выступать в качестве законного представителя. Согласно статье 437, к этой роли могут быть приглашены не только непосредственные представители, но и ближайшие родственники [22, c. 28]. Возникает вопрос о выборе лучшего кандидата на роль представителя в соответствии с частью 4 статьи 426 УПК РФ. Некоторые источники, такие как Зайнуллин Р.И. и Андрейкин А.А., предлагают доверить этот выбор несовершеннолетнему или определить посредством семейного соглашения [8, c. 4] [6, c. 44]. Тем не менее, возникает этическая дилемма для подростка иметь возможность выбора между, например, отцом и матерью, что может повлиять на эффективность защиты интересов подростка [16, c. 49]. Мы разделяем мнение с Зайнуллиным Р.И. и Андрейкиным А.А., но следует дополнить, что подросток может выбрать неблагонадежного законного представителя, который может исказить показание свое подопечного или наоборот не является следственными действиями, также могут настаивать на применении более строгих мер наказания. Мы устанавливаем, что в случаях, когда условия жизни и воспитания подростка благоприятны, выбор законного представителя может быть предоставлен семье, но в обратной ситуации следователь должен взять на себя решение этого вопроса, основываясь на сведениях от различных источников. В контексте этих прав, речь идет не только о юридической, но и о морально-психологической поддержке несовершеннолетнего, которую могут обеспечить только лица, находящиеся с ним в близких доверительных отношениях. Также следует подчеркнуть, что законный представитель, как и защитник, имеет полный спектр прав и возможностей для защиты интересов ребенка в уголовном процессе. Изученный опыт свидетельствует о том, что согласно части 2 статьи 426 УПК РФ, законный представитель уже обладает рядом прав в досудебном производстве, в числе которых: право на информацию о подозрении или обвинении, участие в допросе, возможность присутствия при проведении следственных действий, доступ к документам и протоколам, знакомство с материалами дела после завершения предварительного следствия и возможность внесения в них своих замечаний и предложений. Можно сделать вывод о том, что при рассмотрении участия законных представителей в уголовном процессе, крайне важно подчеркнуть их роль в обеспечении не только правовой, но и всесторонней поддержки интересов несовершеннолетнего, что требует активного взаимодействия всех участников процесса. Отдельный вопрос касается применения мер процессуального принуждения к несовершеннолетним. Хотя статья 423 УПК РФ отмечает необходимость рассмотрения всех возможностей применения меньших мер пресечения, в том числе присмотра согласно статье 105 УПК РФ, Г.П. Химичева выделяет, что правовые нормы не всегда способны рассмотреть баланс между правами подростков и целями уголовного судопроизводства [25]. Мы разделяем мнение с Г.П. Химичевой, поскольку главной целью уголовного судопроизводства является наказать, предупредить и возместить ущерб потерпевшей стороне, здесь может возникнуть проблема в том, что у подростков есть права, которые нельзя нарушать, но соблюдение последних может не всегда позволить достигнуть нужного результата, так как дальнейшее зависит от множества факторов. По нашему мнению, стоит уделить особое внимание на исправительные меры и регламентацию их применения, то особое внимание следует уделить альтернативным видам наказания, таким как общественные работы, программы перевоспитания и лечение от зависимостей, с учетом возраста, социального контекста дела и индивидуальных характеристик несовершеннолетних. Анализ правоприменительной практики указывает на то, что наиболее часто используемыми мерами пресечения в отношении несовершеннолетних являются подписка о невыезде и заключение под стражу [5]. Здесь решающими факторами выступают отработанные процедуры применения этих мер и формальные основания для ограничения свободы в рамках досудебного производства [5]. В заключение, современная правоприменительная практика в отношении несовершеннолетних стремится к созданию условий, при которых молодые люди, совершившие проступок, получают шанс на исправление без ущерба для своего будущего. Принятые меры пресечения и особенности их исполнения должны способствовать не только выполнению неотъемлемых нужд правосудия, но и сохранению социальной ценности каждого молодого человека, совершенствованию его индивидуальных качеств и успешному воспитательному процессу. Ювенальная юстиция в России исторически претерпела значительные изменения, отходя от средневековой практики равенства уголовной ответственности без учета возраста до современной системы, которая отстаивает принципы гуманизации и дифференциации. Согласно действующему законодательству, учитываются возраст, пол, социальное положение и психофизическое состояние несовершеннолетних при назначении наказания, стремясь обеспечить юридическую и социальную поддержку. Законодательные и процессуальные нормы устанавливают особые гарантии для подростков, включая право на защиту адвокатом, участие законных представителей и специалистов в судопроизводстве, а также применение альтернативных мер, таких как принудительные меры воспитательного воздействия. Такой подход призван не только соблюдать закон, но и способствовать их социальной адаптации и воспитанию. В целом, тенденции развития ювенальной юстиции в России показывают стремление создать систему, ценящую каждую молодую личность и акцентирующую внимание на перспективе их социализации и интеграции в общество, а не исключительно на наказании. Это подчеркивает важность усилений, направленных на поддержку и развитие несовершеннолетних в легальном пространстве, способствуя снижению рецидива преступлений среди молодежи и укреплению общественного доверия к правоохранительной системе. В первой главе были рассмотрены общие положения о расследовании уголовных дел в отношении несовершеннолетних, определены основные понятия и прослежена эволюция подходов к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних в российском законодательстве. Исторический очерк показал тенденцию к ужесточению норм в военные и послевоенные периоды и последующему пересмотру этих норм в сторону гуманизации и индивидуализации подходов в период стабилизации общественной ситуации. Таким образом, первая глава определяет основу для дальнейшего исследования вопросов насколько эффективно и справедливо происходит процесс расследования уголовных дел в отношении несовершеннолетних, а также направлений возможных реформ системы, с учетом международной практики и современных тенденций развития юриспруденции.","output":"Для создания слайда по первой главе Вашей работы, вам необходимо сформировать материал, который будет лаконично излагать основные моменты раздела, не перегружая слайд излишней информацией.

ОБЩИЕ ПОЛОЖЕНИЯ О РАССЛЕДОВАНИИ ПО УГОЛОВНЫМ ДЕЛАМ В ОТНОШЕНИИ НЕСОВЕРШЕННОЛЕТНИХ 1.2 Особенности производства по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних Производство по делам несовершеннолетним состоит из двух основных этапов: возбуждение уголовного дела и предварительное расследование. При этом важно установить наличие или отсутствие взрослого соучастника еще на стадии возбуждения уголовного дела. Если невозможно исключить участие взрослого соучастника, то дело все равно должно быть возбуждено, и на стадии предварительного расследования проводится проверка по данной версии [9]. В уголовных делах о несовершеннолетних доказываются следующие обстоятельства в соответствии с УПК РФ ст. 73 и 421: Возраст несовершеннолетнего, точная дата рождения; Жизненные условия, воспитание, личностные особенности, уровень психического развития; Влияние на несовершеннолетнего со стороны взрослых; При умственной отсталости, не связанной с психическим расстройством, способность понимать и контролировать свои действия и бездействия; При совершении преступлений средней тяжести и выше, исключая случаи из ст. 92 УК РФ [3], наличие либо отсутствие заболеваний, мешающих нахождению в спецучреждении. [10] Эти факты выясняются через допрос родителей, учителей и других информированных лиц, изучение документов и проведение следственных либо судебных процедур. Лицо достигает возраста уголовной ответственности на день после своего дня рождения, и, если документ, подтверждающий возраст, отсутствует, назначается судебно-медицинская экспертиза. В случае ее проведения дата, указанная как год рождения, признается днем рождения подозреваемого или обвиняемого. Входе предварительного расследования может возникнуть необходимость в установлении точного возраста в этом случае следователь или дознаватель может вынести решение о назначении медицинского освидетельствования, в соответствии с требованиями Правительства РФ. [11] Делается вывод о том, что для уголовного дела критично установить ключевые аспекты: факт преступления, вину, виновное поведение, мотивацию, условия, влияющие на юридическую ответственность, исключения из-за отсутствия преступных действий, основания для освобождения от ответственности, ущерб и предшествующие факторы преступления. В уголовном процессе по делам несовершеннолетних подозреваемый или обвиняемый должен иметь как защитника, так и законного представителя. По УПК РФ статье 51 [2], участие защитника является обязательным для несовершеннолетних, и следователи обязаны гарантировать его присутствие в процессе, даже если несовершеннолетний этого не хочет, как указано в части 2 статьи 52 УПК РФ. Несоблюдение этого требования считается серьезным нарушением прав несовершеннолетнего на защиту и является существенным нарушением уголовно-процессуального закона (в соответствии с пунктом 4 части 2 статьи 381 УПК РФ). При рассмотрении дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними, вопрос о приглашении защитника, как правило, решается через законного представителя несовершеннолетнего [12]. Участие законного представителя в деле является обязательным не только на стадии предварительного расследования, но и на последующих судебных этапах. К представителям относятся родители, усыновители, опекуны, или попечители несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого либо потерпевшего, а также представители учреждений или организаций, на попечении которых находится подозреваемый, в соответствии с пунктом 12 статьи 5 УПК РФ. Правовой статус законного представителя на стадии предварительного расследования определен статьей 426 УПК РФ [2]. Мы приходим к выводу, что эффективное участие законного представителя в уголовном процессе с первого допроса подростка является главным элементом, гарантирующим защиту прав и интересов несовершеннолетнего. В законе прописан полный перечень всех прав законных представителей, а также приписываются обязательства в случае нарушении последних возможна замена представителя. Это позволяет гарантировать соблюдение интересов подростков на всех этапах расследования. Гражданский ответчик, являющийся ответственным за несовершеннолетнего в случае совершении им преступного деяния, выступает активной стороной в уголовном процессе. Выступать в качестве гражданского ответчика может не только физическое лицо, но и юридическое согласно Гражданскому кодексу РФ. Привлечение ответчика производится постановлением следователя, дознавателя или судом, решение выносит суд в соответствии со статьей 54 УПК РФ [2]. Уголовное судопроизводство по делам несовершеннолетних предполагает особенности в процедурных действиях, включая вызов несовершеннолетнего. Он осуществляется через его родителей или законных представителей при вызове к следователю, дознавателю или в суд по статье 424 УПК РФ. Если несовершеннолетний находится под стражей, вызов проходит через учреждение его содержания [14]. Допрос несовершеннолетнего также имеет ряд особенностей, которые определены в статье 425 УПК РФ: 1. Допрос несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого не может продолжаться без перерыва более двух часов и в общей сложности не более четырех часов в день. 2. Допрос подозреваемого или обвиняемого несовершеннолетнего осуществляется с участием защитника, последний вправе задавать вопросы и ознакомится с протоколом допроса, а также делать замечание по нему. 3. Лица, не достигшие возраста 16 лет или достигшего этого возраста, но страдающие психическими расстройствами или отстающими в психическом развитии допрашиваются с участием педагога или психолога. 4. Педагог или психолог, вправе с разрешения следователя или дознавателя задавать вопросы несовершеннолетнему подозреваемому, обвиняемому. Знакомится с протоколом допроса и делать письменные замечания. Эти права разъясняются всем участникам допроса и делается отметка в протоколе. На основе выполненного анализа ст. 425 УПК РФ можно утверждать, что данные предписания повышают вероятность более точного расследования преступления путем учета различных особенностей подростков и тем самым обеспечиваются их права. Применение мер принуждения к несовершеннолетним регулируется общими правилами по главам 12 и 13 УПК РФ [2]. Заключение под стражу используется для несовершеннолетних при подозрении в совершении тяжких или особо тяжких преступлений, согласно статье 108 УПК РФ, и в исключительных случаях — для преступлений средней тяжести. Ограничений для задержания по подозрению в преступлении закон не предусматривает [15]. Законный представитель несовершеннолетнего имеет право присутствовать в суде при решении вопроса о заключении его под стражу и получать копию решения об избрании меры пресечения, согласно части 4 статьи 108 и части 2 статьи 101 УПК РФ [2]. Для подростков предусмотрена, такая мера пресечения как передача под надзор родителям или законным представителям, в соответствии со ст. 105 УПК РФ. Эти меры применяются только под письменное согласие что в последствии обеспечивает явку в следственные органы и в суд. В случае несоблюдения этих обязанностей к надзирающим лицам могут быть применены меры взыскания в согласно ч. 4 ст. 103 УПК РФ [17]. Прекращение уголовного дела и преследования происходит по общим нормам, урегулированным статьями 24-28 УПК РФ. Согласно статье 427 УПК РФ, предусмотрена возможность прекращения уголовного преследования несовершеннолетнего на стадии предварительного расследования и применение воспитательных мер влияния, если: несовершеннолетний совершил преступление небольшой или средней тяжести; Есть основания считать, что исправление возможно без применения уголовного наказания; Сам несовершеннолетний и его законный представитель согласны с таким прекращением уголовного преследования. При согласии следователя и прокурора, они выносят постановление о прекращении условного преследования и возбуждении ходатайства о применении принудительных мер воспитательного воздействия перед судом. Судья рассматривает материалы дела и ходатайство в соответствии с требованиями статьи 108 УПК РФ [2]. Если судья соглашается с принятым решением органа предварительного расследования, он применяет к несовершеннолетнему принудительные меры воспитательного воздействия. Контроль за соблюдением этих мер возлагается на специализированный государственный орган, ответственный за исправление несовершеннолетних, по решению суда. Если несовершеннолетний систематически не соблюдает требования, предусмотренные принудительной мерой воспитательного воздействия, судья, по представлению специализированного государственного органа, может отменить принудительную меру и направить материалы прокурору для дальнейшего рассмотрения уголовного дела [19]. Следователь может постановить не допускать несовершеннолетнего к ознакомлению с материалами дела, которые могут оказать на него негативное влияние, ограничив ознакомление только законным представителем. Процесс рассмотрения уголовных дел с участием несовершеннолетних обладает особыми чертами, которые учитывают их возраст, статус и участие вместе с взрослыми лицами. Установленные нормы направлены на то, чтобы обеспечить правильное и эффективное осуществление правосудия в случаях, когда осуждаются или судятся несовершеннолетние.","output":"На основе предоставленного вами текста, давайте создадим структурированный слайд для презентации первой главы, секции 1.2 \\"Особенности производства по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних\\". **1.

Recent simulations, illustrated in a chilling video of a flooding map, starkly demonstrate a future where vast portions of Cape Cod could transform into a scattered archipelago of islands, as rising waters link the Atlantic with Cape Cod Bay. The video, which readers can view online, encapsulates a scenario that could unfold sooner than most might think. The coastline's characteristic fine sand offers little resistance to the relentless forces of nature. As global sea levels continue to rise, the threat is no longer a distant concern; it is an urgent reality knocking on the door of every Cape Cod resident. Local conversation has been awash with speculation and concern, but despite the gravity of the situation, there seems to be a chasm between awareness and action. From local communities to state officials in their cozy Boston offices, the response has been woefully inadequate. Many of those tasked with stewarding the Cape's future only enjoy its beaches during the balmy summer months, remaining conspicuously absent when winter gales and 'king tides' ravage the coast. While funding to combat coastal erosion is often discussed in the marbled halls of government, the truth that no one seems ready to confront is the lack of a viable, lasting solution to this relentless natural process. Funds are directed towards short-term fixes, like beach replenishment or seawalls that often prove futile against the might of the ocean. The sand, ever so soft, seems to slip through the fingers of those clinging to stop-gap measures. The reality of our coastal predicament must be faced head-on. We need to shift from a shallow strategy of temporary defenses to one of adaptation, acknowledging that some changes will be irreversible. The destiny of Cape Cod's coastline is not just a matter of protecting property and infrastructure; it is about safeguarding the rich heritage and natural beauty of a place cherished by so many. As residents or lovers of the Cape, we must convene dialogue, galvanize our communities, and press for action that looks beyond the short term. Our elected officials should be feet in the sand during winter's fury as much as they are in summer's charm, recognizing that effective coastal management is a year-round commitment. However, perhaps the most potent weapon we have against this tide of change is our collective consciousness and our willingness to adapt to the new realities of our environment. It will require courage, ingenuity, and perhaps most importantly, a unified commitment to safeguarding Cape Cod for future generations. The responsibility to act lies with every one of us – from the policymakers in Boston to the citizens who walk the shores of this treasured peninsula. We must rise above the notion that this is someone else's problem, for inaction today will lead to tangible loss tomorrow. Let's begin writing a new coastal narrative, one of resilience and foresight, lest the Cape we know and love becomes a memory swallowed by the sea."},{"instruction":"Rewrite text above and say that here’s the video of map who shows right now flooded areas, and those areas every time expands.","output":"# Rising Tides: Cape Cod's Battle Against the Inexorable Sea CAPE COD, MA – Today, we turn our attention to an alarming video that graphically charts the present and future of our beloved Cape Cod—a future that is increasingly waterlogged. The map, which you can view online, starkly illustrates the areas of the Cape currently experiencing flooding. With each passing day, these areas expand, driven by the relentless encroachment of the sea upon our shores. The unsettling footage stands as a stark warning, showing the susceptibility of Cape Cod's coastline to the dual threats of coastal erosion and rising sea levels. Predominantly composed of delicate sands, our landscape can do little to fend off nature's might. If left unchecked, we could see a transformation so profound that it reshapes Cape Cod into a smattering of disconnected islets, separating the Atlantic from Cape Cod Bay. Readers are encouraged to watch the video and witness the vast tracts of Cape Cod that already succumb to flooding. It's an eye-opening experience that underlines the urgency of our situation. As the inundation reaches further inland with each high tide and storm surge, it becomes clear that we sit on the front lines of a much larger environmental battle. Despite numerous discussions and debates, little substantial progress has been made toward a sustainable solution for Cape Cod's coastal erosion and flooding woes. Many decision-makers, comfortable in their Boston offices, appear out of touch with the harsh winter realities facing the Cape. Their interactions with the coastline may be limited to idyllic summer visits, remaining distant from the stark truth that is winter storms and destructive Nor'easters. The lack of a practical long-term solution and the inadequate handling of allocated funds present a grim picture: no amount of money seems capable of turning the tide. The protective measures in place often seem as transient as the sand they are built upon. What these flooding maps make clear is that we must transcend the cycle of temporary fixes and face the inevitability of change with boldness and innovation. This isn't just about protecting land; it's about preserving the Cape's unique heritage and the living environment for those who call it home. Confronting this challenge requires collective effort—elected officials must join hands with local communities, standing on the increasingly narrow strips of beach in the winter chill as they do in the summer warmth, demonstrating their allegiance to year-round, proactive coastal stewardship. The onus to act is upon us all. The creeping waters shown in today's video won't recede on their own accord. We must forge a new path, one that balances the natural evolution of our coastline with creative resilience strategies. If we fail to unite in preserving what we hold dear, the Cape Cod immortalized in postcards and memories may soon be a series of water-bound relics. Together, let's confront this tide with the gravity it deserves, advocating for seasoned wisdom in the policies that will shape our coastal narrative. Let's be the generation that did not let Cape Cod down, ensuring its survival not just as a geographical location but as a living legacy to be cherished by those who follow."},{"instruction":"Rewrite article above and say that here outer Cape flood map where you can see flooding areas witch expanding very fast.","output":"# Cape Cod's Vanishing Shores: An Alarming View of Rapid Flood Expansion CAPE COD, MA – A new flood map of the outer Cape Cod, available online for all to see, offers a sobering view of the coastal erosion and flooding currently at work. The areas submerged under water are not only evident but expanding at an alarming rate, demonstrating a threat that is immediate and accelerating. The map, which we urge our readers to view, brings into sharp focus the stark reality facing the outer arm of the peninsula. With the soft, sandy terrain offering little resistance, the trademark boundaries of Cape Cod are being steadily redrafted by the encroaching sea. This insidious process is no longer a theoretical projection but a manifest danger, as the Atlantic Ocean threatens to consume broad swathes of land, melding with the waters of Cape Cod Bay. Today's flooding areas, as shown on the map, are a stark reminder that the issue of rising sea levels and erosion is not one that can be relegated to future generations. With every storm, with each high tide, our coastline retreats further, eroding the very foundation of communities that have thrived here for centuries. Despite the critical nature of this situation, efforts to counteract these forces remain tenuous at best. The decision-makers, often secluded in their Boston offices, lack an on-the-ground perspective of the Cape's winter temperament. Their understanding of coastal management seems adrift, much like the sand that slips away with each wave. As funds are poured into what are increasingly looking like futile attempts at holding back the ocean, the truth is cemented: no fortification is a match for the unyielding march of the seas. The defenses hastily constructed are, after all, built on the very element in retreat—our beautifully soft, but vulnerable, coastal sands. Confronting this reality means acknowledging the transformative power of nature and our limits in taming it. It calls for the resolve to embrace more than just the transient shielding of sea walls or beach nourishment. This sight of the outer Cape's rampant flooding underscores the need for forward-thinking adaptation and sustainable solutions that work with, not against, our environment. The challenge is collective—a summon to all, from state representatives to local denizens, to witness the imperiled Cape as it stands today, not merely in the reprieve of summer sun. Active engagement and informed, year-round commitment from our political leaders are essential in crafting a coherent plan that addresses the scale of the threat. Invite viewership of the flood map not as a scare tactic but as a catalyst for action and a call to arms. Cape Cod's future hinges not on hope, but on the concerted efforts of every stakeholder. We must recognize our shared responsibility to protect and preserve this iconic landscape. Otherwise, we risk watching helplessly as the familiar contours of our home dissolve beneath the waves. Let's take ownership of the task that lies before us.

And it must be said: in the grand boardrooms and statehouses, in conference rooms far removed from our sea-sprayed reality, the solutions offered seem as flimsy as the plans sketched on paper. It's not for want of trying, but perhaps it's a question of understanding. Our officials may need to swap the comfort of leather chairs for the unyielding, winter-chilled sands of our eroding beaches. They need to see, firsthand, that our coastline doesn't stand up to the elements in the same way their policies don’t stand up to the realities of nature. The map shows us a future we are ill-prepared for—a patchwork Cape Cod, its coves and inlets gone, its characteristic landscape redrawn in a manner unrecognizable to those who have lingered on its beaches, fished its waters, and called it home. So we turn to you, our readers, our neighbors, our friends: What ideas do you have to stem this tide? What solutions can we—as a community bonded by salt and sand—bring to the table? Whether it's through innovative engineering, nature-based solutions, or community-driven initiatives, we want to hear what you can dream up to keep Cape Cod from becoming a mere outline beneath the water. As you ponder, remember that it is the human connection to this land that binds us. We face these rising waters together, inheritors of the Cape's rugged beauty and guardians of its future. Submit your suggestions, join the conversation, and let's approach this as the united and resilient community we are. Together, we can find answers to safeguard our shared shores. What's your vision for protecting Cape Cod from the relentless tide?"},{"instruction":"Write more in personal terms,that I’m writing this","output":"# A Plea from the Heart: Cape Cod's Disappearing Shoreline To my fellow Cape Codders, As someone who's walked these beaches from childhood, who's felt the pulse of our community through every season, I come to you not just as a reporter, but as a neighbor deeply concerned about the future of the place we all love. I've watched a video that's making the rounds online—a map showing the flood zones of our outer Cape—and it's hard to ignore the reality it presents. The areas bathed in blue, those regions now succumbing to floods, are expanding before our eyes, faster than I ever thought possible. Here's the link to the video, and I encourage you to watch it. It's more than science; it's a call to action. These aren't obscure, distant regions; these are the nooks of our shared backyard, the places where we've celebrated, sought solace, and made a life by the water. We can't kid ourselves anymore. The Cape we know is changing, dissolving into the advancing sea with each tide. The sands where children build castles and couples stroll at sunset are at the mercy of forces that refuse to be ignored. We've talked about seawalls and dune restorations, but these have felt like placing a band-aid on a wound that requires stitches. Truth be told, the conversation happening in Boston, in offices far removed from our everyday struggles, hasn't brought a solution we can count on. They don't often walk our shores when the cold nor'easters blow, when the angry waves take another bite of our land. To truly understand, they'd need to stand with us as the storm surge laps at the very ground beneath our feet. We've reached a point where we must take the future into our own hands. The map paints a troubling picture, one we cannot accept as our inevitable fate. It's down to us—those who know and love the Cape—to conceive a plan that can hold back the rising tide. So, I'm reaching out directly to you, to tap into the wellspring of knowledge, creativity, and ingenuity that I've seen time and again in our communities. Do you have thoughts on how we defend our coast? Are there innovative barrier designs, ecological solutions, or community efforts that we've missed? Share them. Speak up. You're not just a voice in the crowd—you're the heart and soul of Cape Cod, and it's your insight that could lead us to a more hopeful chapter for our shared home. Together, we are more than a geographical label; we're a tapestry of lives interconnected by saltwater, sand, and an undying affection for this spit of land jutting into the Atlantic. What suggestions do you have that can help protect our peninsula from disappearing beneath the waves? With your help, we can face this challenge head-on and forge a path to preserve Cape Cod not only for ourselves but for our children and their children after them. In unity and hope, [Your Name]"},{"instruction":"Rewrite and say that organizations just getting money that promises to fix coastal erosion, but in reality I don’t see that those solutions working","output":"# A Cape Codder's Call: Is Our Shoreline Protection Just a Mirage? To my Cape Cod neighbors, Today, I find myself writing not just as a journalist, but as a lifelong witness to the changing tides of our beloved Cape. Foremost, I am one of you—a resident who treasures the sandy stretches of our home. I've seen a video, a map of foreboding, illustrating our current reality with flooding areas that seem to broaden with each passing storm. I’m sharing the link for all to see. Watch it and understand that what once seemed a distant threat now laps at the doorsteps of our community. The expanse of blue represents more than just encroaching waters; it symbolizes a challenge to our identity and to the heritage of our Cape. We've been promised solutions for years. Organizations have been entrusted with funds, each promising to deliver answers to our coastal erosion concerns. Yet, as each winter bites and each storm rages, I can't help but look out to see the same vulnerable beaches, the same precarious cliffs, and wonder where that promise has gone. I question the effectiveness of the costly endeavors we've been sold—the seawalls, the sandbags, the beach renourishment projects. They began as assurances, rallying points filled with hope. Now, they resemble nothing so much as attempts to hold back the ocean with wishes and whispers. Skepticism hasn't been my nature, but experience has taught us all a difficult lesson: money alone can't reforge our coastlines or mend the cycles of nature. The conversation up in Boston, from my view, has yet to yield a strategy that withstands the fierce Nor'easters or the overbearing surge of high tides. We're witnesses to this struggle. We feel the pang of inaction when organizations receive support to stem the tide yet deliver no lasting bulwark against the sea that edges closer by the year. The grand declarations and press conferences feel a world away when you stand, as I do, before a shoreline that continues to surrender to the waves. So I ask, truly, what can be done? It’s time to harness our collective wisdom, insight, and passion for the Cape and transform them into action. If the formal efforts aren’t meeting the mark, perhaps it’s our turn to raise our voices, to share those innovative ideas that have been overlooked or undervalued in the past. Speak your mind, neighbors. If the sanctioned measures fall short, your grassroots strategies, your local knowledge, and your unorthodox approaches might just harbor the answers we so desperately seek. It's clear that passion for our home is something we have no shortage of. Let’s channel that into finding real solutions that will preserve the Cape for tomorrows yet to come. Can we afford to wait and see, or is it finally time to take the future into our own hands?

The behavior of players during football matches, including lying down or time-wasting tactics, is a complex phenomenon and is not inherently linked to ethnicity. It is influenced by a combination of factors such as: 1. Coaching strategies: Coaches may employ tactics that involve time-wasting to preserve a lead or disrupt the flow of the game in their favor. 2. Player behavior: Individual players might choose to lie down or feign injury to gain a tactical advantage, recover from fatigue, or influence the referee's decisions. 3. Cultural aspects of the game: Distinct football cultures can have different attitudes towards the sportsmanship and competitiveness of the game. 4. Competition rules and enforcement: How strictly referees enforce the rules and how competitions penalize time-wasting can impact the frequency of such behavior. It's important to note that time-wasting tactics occur in football leagues around the world, not just in the Middle East, and are not exclusive to any ethnicity or region. It is a behavior seen in many sports and can be viewed as part of the strategic element of the game, although it's often looked down upon by fans and sports commentators who prefer a more fluid, continuous play. Stating that such behavior is related to ethnicity is not only inaccurate but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes that do not account for the individual and strategic decisions made within the context of each game or competition.

Here is a list of some alternatives: 1. **Adaptive Contrast Enhancement (ACE):** This is a local image contrast enhancement algorithm that works by dividing the image into small regions and then enhancing the contrast of each region independently. It is particularly effective at bringing out details in shadow regions without over-amplifying noise. 2. **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE):** Although it's a form of histogram equalization, CLAHE limits the contrast enhancement in homogeneous areas to reduce noise amplification. It's often used in medical imaging and other applications where preserving local contrast is important. 3. **Retinex-based algorithms:** Retinex theory deals with the perception of colors and saturation in different lighting conditions. The Single-Scale Retinex (SSR) and Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) algorithms enhance contrast by simulating the way the human eye perceives lightness and color. These methods are useful for correcting images taken in non-uniform lighting. 4. **Gamma Correction:** Gamma correction enhances contrast by applying a non-linear transformation to the intensity values of the image. By using a gamma value different from 1 (typically < 1 to enhance contrast, > 1 to reduce contrast), the algorithm can selectively increase the contrast in either bright or dark regions of the image. 5. **Unsharp Masking (USM):** This technique enhances edges by subtracting a blurred (unsharp) version of the image from the original image. The result is an increase in edge contrast, making the image appear sharper. 6. **Local Contrast Enhancement:** Algorithms based on local contrast enhancement increase the contrast between neighboring pixels. This process can be implemented through methods like the Laplacian filter, which enhances edges by highlighting the rate of intensity change. 7. **Wavelet Transform:** This method decomposes an image into a set of basis functions (wavelets). By manipulating the coefficients in the wavelet domain, it's possible to enhance the contrast at different scales, selectively improving details in various regions of the image. 8. **Curves Adjustment:** In this approach, a non-linear curve is applied to the intensity levels of an image. By manually adjusting the curve or using an algorithm to find the best curve, one can increase contrast in specific intensity ranges. These algorithms vary widely in their complexity and suitability for different types of images. Some may be more appropriate for photographic images with subtle variations in light and shadow, while others are designed to enhance contrast in scientific or medical imagery. When implementing contrast enhancement, it's essential to consider what the goals are for image enhancement and the specific characteristics of the images being processed."},{"instruction":"How can I implement Adaptive Contrast Enhancement in python.","output":"Implementing Adaptive Contrast Enhancement (ACE) in Python can be done using the OpenCV or PIL libraries, among others. Here's a simple example of how to implement a form of Adaptive Contrast Enhancement using OpenCV. This example assumes you have OpenCV installed. If not, you can install it via pip: \`\`\`bash pip install opencv-python \`\`\` Here is an example script that performs a simple version of Adaptive Contrast Enhancement using OpenCV: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np def adaptive_contrast_enhancement(image, clip_limit=2.0, tile_grid_size=(8, 8)): # Convert the image to LAB color space lab = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB) # Split the LAB image to L, a, and b channels l, a, b = cv2.split(lab) # Apply CLAHE to L channel (consider CLAHE an improved version of adaptive contrast enhancement) clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=clip_limit, tileGridSize=tile_grid_size) cl = clahe.apply(l) # Merge the CLAHE enhanced L channel back with a and b channels limg = cv2.merge((cl,a,b)) # Convert image back to BGR color space enhanced_img = cv2.cvtColor(limg, cv2.COLOR_LAB2BGR) return enhanced_img # Read your image img = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg') # Apply the Adaptive Contrast Enhancement enhanced_img = adaptive_contrast_enhancement(img) # Display the original and enhanced images cv2.imshow('Original Image', img) cv2.imshow('Enhanced Image', enhanced_img) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows() # Optionally, write the enhanced image to a file cv2.imwrite('enhanced_image.jpg', enhanced_img) \`\`\` In this implementation, we use the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), which is a variant of ACE. It applies adaptive histogram equalization in local tiles, and contrast enhancement is limited to avoid amplifying noise. The \`clip_limit\` is a threshold for contrast limiting, and \`tile_grid_size\` determines the size of the contextual region used for histogram equalization. Although it uses histogram equalization, CLAHE is considered more advanced and adaptable for different image regions, compared to global histogram equalization, which is why it's a commonly recommended method for ACE tasks. Note that true Adaptive Contrast Enhancement can be subjective and can vary depending on the specific implementation and desired outcome. Advanced implementations might include more sophisticated local analysis and modifications of the image."},{"instruction":"This doesn't very automatic if I have to specify clip_limit and tile_grid_size","output":"You are correct that specifying parameters such as \`clip_limit\` and \`tile_grid_size\` means the process isn't fully automatic in the strictest sense because these parameters can affect the result and might be tuned based on the characteristics of each specific image or set of images. However, the values you provide can be seen as defaults, and in many cases, standard values work well across a wide variety of images. If you desire a more automatic approach, you can implement a method that adjusts the parameters based on the characteristics of the image. For example, the \`clip_limit\` could be set as a function of the variance in intensity values, and the \`tile_grid_size\` could be based on the dimensions of the image. Here's an example of how you might adjust the \`clip_limit\` automatically based on the variance of the image: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np def compute_clip_limit(image, base_clip_limit=2.0): # Compute the standard deviation of the image image_stddev = np.std(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)) # Adjust the clip limit based on the standard deviation # Here we normalize the std deviation: the higher it is, the less we clip adjusted_clip_limit = base_clip_limit * (1 + image_stddev / 128.) return adjusted_clip_limit def adaptive_contrast_enhancement(image, base_clip_limit=2.0): # Compute an adjusted clip limit clip_limit = compute_clip_limit(image, base_clip_limit) # Compute the tile grid size based on the image size tile_grid_size = (image.shape[0] // 8, image.shape[1] // 8) # Convert the image to LAB color space lab = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB) # Split the LAB image to L, a, and b channels l, a, b = cv2.split(lab) # Apply CLAHE to L channel clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=clip_limit, tileGridSize=tile_grid_size) cl = clahe.apply(l) # Merge the CLAHE enhanced L channel back with a and b channels limg = cv2.merge((cl,a,b)) # Convert image back to BGR color space enhanced_img = cv2.cvtColor(limg, cv2.COLOR_LAB2BGR) return enhanced_img # Read your image img = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg') # Apply the Adaptive Contrast Enhancement enhanced_img = adaptive_contrast_enhancement(img) # Display the original and enhanced images cv2.imshow('Original Image', img) cv2.imshow('Enhanced Image', enhanced_img) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows() # Optionally, write the enhanced image to a file cv2.imwrite('enhanced_image.jpg', enhanced_img) \`\`\` The function \`compute_clip_limit\` takes the standard deviation of the image’s intensity as an indicator of contrast and adjusts the \`clip_limit\` based on that. The idea is that if the image already has a high variance (i.e., contrast), you don't want to amplify the contrast as much, so you increase the base \`clip_limit\` less or even reduce it. An image with lower contrast (i.e., lower standard deviation of intensities) would have its \`clip_limit\` increased more to push for greater contrast enhancement. Please note that these adjustments are heuristics and may still not be optimal for all types of images. The best approach for a fully automated system might involve machine learning techniques to analyze a variety of image features and adaptively set the parameters for each specific image based on training with a large and diverse set of images. However, such an approach requires substantial data and computational resources to implement."},{"instruction":"If CLAHE is local, why is clip_limit computed over the entire image? I need this to work on images that have both very dark and very bright areas.","output":"The CLAHE algorithm indeed operates locally on the image, enhancing contrast in small regions (tiles). However, the \`clip_limit\` parameter is a global threshold that limits the contrast enhancement for each of these regions. It's a way to prevent excessive contrast enhancement that could lead to noise amplification. By calculating a single \`clip_limit\` for the entire image, we maintain a consistent enhancement constraint across all regions. The reason for computing a single \`clip_limit\` value rather than a local one for each region is a practical consideration to simplify the algorithm and ensure smooth transitions between tiles. Otherwise, you could end up with tile boundaries becoming visible due to inconsistent enhancement across different regions of the image. If you are dealing with images that have both very dark and very bright areas and you want to ensure that both are properly enhanced, CLAHE is a good choice as it will adapt the histogram equalization to each local tile. However, if the range of intensities across the image varies greatly, you might want to explore more dynamic methods to calculate distinct \`clip_limit\` values for different tiles or parts of the image. A truly adaptive approach might involve dividing the image into regions based on their characteristics (e.g., brightness, contrast) and computing a \`clip_limit\` for each region. But such an approach would significantly complicate the algorithm, and it might be challenging to ensure a natural look without introducing artifacts. For images with a high dynamic range, you could also consider other techniques like Dynamic Range Compression (DRC) or High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging, which are designed to handle scenes with a wide range of intensities. In practice, however, CLAHE with a judiciously chosen global \`clip_limit\` and \`tile_grid_size\` tends to work quite well even for images with varying brightness levels. If a preset \`clip_limit\` doesn't give good results across your range of images, you might consider a strategy where you analyze the distribution of intensities in each image and selectively adjust the \`clip_limit\` based on this analysis. For instance, you could: - Segment the image into regions of interest based on brightness or contrast. - Apply a different \`clip_limit\` or even a different instance of CLAHE to each region. - Carefully blend the boundaries to avoid visible seams. Remember, though, that every additional layer of complexity could introduce new challenges and edge cases that need to be addressed. Therefore, it might be valuable to experiment with the default CLAHE settings first and observe how well it works with your images before moving on to more complicated solutions."},{"instruction":"My images range from very bright sunlight to darkest night with external flash, CLAHE is worst alogrithm I've tried.

I'm working with images that range exps","output":"If CLAHE is not giving you satisfactory results, and Homomorphic Filtering has limitations for your use case, you may need to explore other techniques that are designed for high dynamic range (HDR) scenes or that can deal with lighting variations more effectively. One approach that is often used for images with a wide range of intensities is multi-scale Retinex, especially its variant known as Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR). Retinex theory is based on the assumption that the perceived color of an object is invariant to the illumination source and that the human visual system is able to separate the illumination from the reflectance in a scene. Below is an example implementation of MSRCR in Python. This requires the OpenCV library, which you can install via \`pip\` if you haven't already done so: \`\`\`bash pip install opencv-python \`\`\` And here is the code: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np def multiscale_retinex_with_color_restoration(image, scales): \\"\\"\\" Perform Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration. Parameters: - image: Input image - scales: List of sigma values for Gaussian blur Returns: - Processed image after applying MSRCR algorithm \\"\\"\\" img_float = np.float32(image) + 1.0 # To avoid log(0) # Weight for the sum of log images retinex = np.zeros_like(img_float) for scale in scales: blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(img_float, (0, 0), scale) retinex += np.log(img_float) - np.log(blurred) retinex = retinex / len(scales) # Averaging # Color Restoration step h, w, _ = image.shape intensity = np.sum(retinex, axis=2) / 3 intensity = cv2.GaussianBlur(intensity, (0, 0), scales[0]) intensity = (intensity - np.min(intensity)) / (np.max(intensity) - np.min(intensity)) intensity = (intensity * 255).astype(np.uint8) intensity = np.expand_dims(intensity, axis=2) / 255.0 # Normalize and convert to 3D array for broadcasting retinex = retinex / intensity # Color Restoration # Simplest Color Balance step (percentile-based) total = h * w * 3.0 low_val = np.percentile(retinex, 1) high_val = np.percentile(retinex, 99) retinex = np.clip(retinex, low_val, high_val) retinex = ((retinex - low_val) / (high_val - low_val)) * 255.0 return retinex.astype(np.uint8) # Define the scales for Retinex scales = [15, 80, 250] # Read your image (make sure it's in BGR format if using OpenCV) img = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg') msrcr_result = multiscale_retinex_with_color_restoration(img, scales) # Show the result cv2.imshow('MSRCR Result', msrcr_result) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows() # Optionally, save the result cv2.imwrite('msrcr_result.jpg', msrcr_result) \`\`\` The \`multiscale_retinex_with_color_restoration\` function takes an image and a list of sigma values to define the scales of Gaussian blur for the Retinex computation. The range of sigma values (\`scales\`) controls the level of detail that is enhanced, and you might need to experiment with this to get the best results for your images. The function also includes a color restoration step and a simple percentile-based color balance step. This approach should work well for images with varying lighting conditions, including those with very bright and very dark regions. However, you might still need to tweak parameters such as sigma values and the percentiles used in the color balance step to better suit your specific images. Remember that finding the perfect solution for such diverse lighting conditions can be challenging, and it will likely require some iteration and tuning specific to your dataset. If you continue to have difficulties, it might be worthwhile to consider machine learning approaches where a model is trained specifically for your image characteristics."},{"instruction":"Using examples of corporate ESG scandals or Industrial Accidents in the past, write a commentary on how not internalizing the externalities cost these firms dearly.

Failure to internalize the costs of ESG-related issues has led to significant financial, reputational, and operational damages for companies involved in scandals or industrial accidents. This commentary examines such instances and suggests ways in which corporations could better internalize externalities for value creation. A significant example is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, where BP faced direct costs (including cleanup and fines) estimated at over 65 billion. The accident revealed failures in safety management and environmental responsibility, indicating a shortcoming in BP’s ESG strategies. Similarly, Volkswagen’s diesel emissions scandal in 2015, known as Dieselgate, shed light on governance issues where the company intentionally programmed engines to cheat on emissions tests. These examples demonstrate that while the costs of these incidents might not have been internalized beforehand, they were eventually borne by the organizations in the form of fines, compensations, and loss of reputation and investor confidence. The commonality in these incidents lies in a failure to assess and manage risks associated with environmental damage and governance practices. These oversights can partly be attributed to a focus on short-term financial performance rather than long-term sustainability and ethical conduct. The issues and risks were not adequately represented on the balance sheets, and their eventual impacts were not integrated into the companies’ strategic outlook. To address these ESG issues, firms can adopt a variety of practices, the first of which is risk assessment and integration. A comprehensive sustainability risk assessment can enable firms to identify potential issues before they manifest. By incorporating these risks into financial and strategic planning, companies can allocate resources for prevention and mitigation efforts. For BP, a robust environmental risk assessment and investment in safety technology could have averted the prodigious costs of the disaster. As for Volkswagen, ethical governance practices and transparent reporting could have fostered a culture where deceit was not tolerated. Further, adopting a stakeholder-centric approach rather than a shareholder-exclusive focus can facilitate the internalization of external costs. Engaging with local communities, environmental groups, and regulators to understand the broader impact of corporate actions can lead to more sustainable operational practices. Corporations can create value by ensuring their practices align with the interests of both shareholders and stakeholders. Innovation in sustainability can also drive value creation. Investing in cleaner technologies and processes can reduce potential environmental liabilities. Benchmarking and adopting industry best practices in both operations and governance can also shield corporations from the consequences of ESG failures. For instance, companies can internally develop or source new technologies that reduce emissions or improve safety and thus preempt possible future regulations or penalties. Transparency plays a pivotal role in internalizing ESG costs. By implementing clear reporting mechanisms for their ESG performance, companies can hold themselves accountable to stakeholders and encourage trust in their corporate conduct. For example, transparent emission reports and third-party audits could have averted the kind of governance disaster seen at Volkswagen. One must consider the prevailing assumption that ESG-related measures are often costly and do not generate immediate financial returns. While there is a grain of truth in this, such an assumption fails to consider the long-term value creation and risk mitigation these measures provide. By incorporating ESG factors into business models, companies can build resilience against future scandals or accidents, which often result in far greater costs. My position is that corporations can create significant value by internalizing the costs related to ESG considerations through a comprehensive, stakeholder-inclusive approach that prioritizes long-term sustainability over short-term gains. Acknowledging the limits of this perspective, it is important to recognize that the actual implementation of such systematic changes can be challenging and requires committed leadership, shift in corporate culture, and sometimes new investments in technology and processes. In conclusion, ESG scandals and industrial accidents highlight the importance of internalizing externalities from the outset. Corporations that fail to account for these can suffer considerable financial, reputational, and operational damage. The way forward lies in embracing comprehensive risk assessments, stakeholder engagement, innovation in sustainability, and transparent reporting mechanisms. The integration of ESG concerns into corporate strategy and operations not only mitigates risks but also opens up new avenues for value creation. The implication of adopting this approach is a transition towards a more sustainable and ethically responsible business paradigm that aligns with the evolving expectations of society and the environment, which will, in turn, benefit the corporations by securing their social license to operate, maintaining investor confidence, and ensuring long-term profitability and growth."},{"instruction":"Write the above like we are addressing the question on paper with Harvard style citation","output":"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues have become imperative for corporations as stakeholders demand more accountability. The failure to internalize the costs of ESG-related risks has resulted in substantial financial, reputational, and operational consequences for corporations implicated in ESG scandals or industrial accidents. This essay examines such instances and proposes methods for corporations to better internalize externalities to create value. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill serves as a significant example of the ramifications of not internalizing ESG costs. BP faced direct costs, including cleanup and fines, estimated to be over 65 billion due to the spill (Bergin, 2011). This incident underscores failures in environmental responsibility and safety management, highlighting BP’s insufficient ESG strategies at the time. Similarly, the Volkswagen emissions scandal in 2015 shed light on governance issues within the company, with engines programmed to cheat emissions tests (Ewing, 2017). These examples demonstrate that although the costs might not have been accounted for beforehand, they were eventually imposed on the organization through financial penalties, reputational damage, and loss of investor trust. Both the BP and Volkswagen cases epitomize the inadequate assessment and management of environmental and governance risks (O'Rourke, 2014; Hotten, 2015). These failures are attributable to a focus on short-term financial performance rather than long-term sustainability and ethical conduct. The potential risks were not suitably represented on the financial statements, with strategic planning failing to account for these impacts. To avoid such ESG failures, firms could adopt comprehensive sustainability risk assessments to identify possible issues proactively. By integrating these risks into financial and strategic outlooks, companies can allocate appropriate resources for prevention and mitigation efforts (Busch & Lewandowski, 2018). For example, BP could have averted the significant costs of the oil spill by investing in robust environmental risk assessment efforts and safety technology. In the case of Volkswagen, embracing ethical governance practices and ensuring transparent reporting could have prevented the regulatory and reputational fallout resulting from the scandal. Embracing a stakeholder-centric approach can lead to sustainability in corporate operations. Engaging with local communities, environmental advocates, and regulators can provide corporations with insights into the broader impacts of their actions and promote alignment between stakeholder and shareholder interests (Freeman, 2010). Innovation is another avenue for internalizing ESG costs and fostering value creation. Investments in cleaner technologies and adherence to industry best practices can reduce the likelihood of future liabilities and regulatory actions (Porter & van der Linde, 1995). Moreover, companies can invest in developing or acquiring new technologies that could preempt future regulations or penalties. Transparency and reporting are essential for internalizing ESG-related costs. Corporations should implement clear reporting mechanisms for their ESG performance to increase accountability (Eccles & Krzus, 2010). For instance, Volkswagen could have averted the governance failure by adopting transparent emission reports and external audits. Critically reviewing the assumption that ESG measures are costly and impede immediate financial returns reveals a problematic short-term orientation. This assumption overlooks the long-term value and risk mitigation provided by incorporating ESG factors into business models (Busch, Bauer & Orlitzky, 2016). This essay posits that corporations can create substantial value by internalizing ESG costs through a comprehensive strategy that prioritizes long-term sustainability. It acknowledges difficulties in the practical implementation of such changes, which require committed leadership and sometimes significant investments. In conclusion, the internalization of ESG costs is critical for preventing the substantial damages experienced by firms like BP and Volkswagen. The integration of ESG factors into corporate strategies and operations mitigates risks while creating new opportunities for value creation. The adoption of risk assessment, stakeholder engagement, sustainability innovation, and transparent reporting can transition businesses towards responsible and sustainable practices, in alignment with society's evolving expectations, thereby securing their reputation, investor trust, and long-term profitability (Porter, Hills & Pfitzer, 2012).

Externalities refer to the costs or benefits that a firm's activities impose on third parties, which are not reflected in the firm's accounting books or market prices. When negative externalities are not internalized, they can result in regulatory fines, legal liabilities, reputational damage, and loss of life and property, all of which can prove costly for businesses in the long run. The Glasgow factory explosion in 2004 at the Stockline Plastics factory resulted in the deaths of nine people and injuries to many others. Investigations revealed safety failings and a lack of adherence to regulations, highlighting a failure to internalize the costs associated with workplace safety (BBC News, 2007). The Dhaka fire in the 2012 Tazreen Fashions factory claimed over 100 lives and injured hundreds more. The disaster pointed to the externalized costs of inadequate fire safety measures and poor working conditions in the pursuit of cheap labor (Yardley, 2012). In 2014, the Kunshan explosion occurred in a wheel hub polishing workshop in Jiangsu Province, China, killing nearly 100 people. This accident brought to light the externalized costs related to health and safety in manufacturing processes (Jacobs, 2014). These tragedies indicate a pattern of firms not recognizing the full scope of their responsibilities. There is a broader cost to society when firms prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability and ethical considerations. These costs can materialize in the form of human tragedies, environmental degradation, and societal uproar and often result in punitive damages that far exceed the costs of implementing responsible ESG practices from the outset. Had these firms internalized the costs associated with their operations, not only could the human tragedies have been averted, but they could also have safeguarded their long-term economic viability. Internalizing such costs involves recognizing the potential for accidents and proactively investing in safety measures, employee training, environmental protections, and ethical governance practices. For instance, in the case of the Glasgow factory, better attention to safety protocols, regular risk assessments, and investments in infrastructure maintenance could have prevented the explosion and saved lives, while potentially avoiding the subsequent legal and compensation costs (HSE, 2007). In Dhaka, proper internalization could have involved investing in fire safety systems, regular building inspections, and adherence to labor laws, which would align with respecting workers' rights and securing the firm's social license to operate (Manik & Yardley, 2012). Similarly, the Kunshan explosion underscores the necessity for firms to invest in safe manufacturing technologies and processes, along with regular audits to evaluate compliance with safety regulations (Bradsher, 2014). These firms could have internalized the externalities by incorporating the potential costs associated with ESG risks into their financial planning and strategic decision-making. By doing so, they could have transformed these costs into investments in their operational integrity, workforce, community trust, and long-term resilience. The proactive internalization of externalities can not only mitigate risks but can also translate into competitive advantages, as firms that are seen as responsible can gain favor with consumers, attract and retain talent, and experience less turbulence in regulatory environments. In conclusion, the Glasgow factory explosion, Dhaka fire, and Kunshan explosion illustrate the heavy toll that not internalizing negative externalities can impose on businesses and societies. Firms that fail to account for the full spectrum of their operations' impacts leave themselves vulnerable to a myriad of adverse outcomes. While the initial cost of internalizing externality costs may seem burdensome, the long-term benefits of avoiding disasters, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage far outweigh the upfront investment. Ethically, economically, and operationally, it behooves firms to adopt forward-thinking ESG practices that acknowledge and address the broader implications of their actions. References: BBC News.

All around me were my fellow battleships - New Jersey, Queen Elizabeth, Mutsu, and even my sister Tirpitz. However, before I became a shipgirl, I was a German ship operator & actress. During the Second World War, I was brought on-board the KMS Bismarck - the first of her class. Little did I know that the day the Bismarck sank would be my last day as a human.)","output":"\\"Strange, isn't it?\\" Mutsu pondered aloud, her voice cutting through the ceaseless chatter of the command room. \\"How fate can intertwine a soul and steel, making something more out of war's harsh demands.\\" She glanced at me with a knowing look, her eyes filled with the sort of depth only the ocean's expanse could match. And in her gaze, I found the reflections of my own past. \\"It is,\\" I replied, my voice a rumble like distant thunder. \\"Who would have thought the spirits of warships would join hands with humanity, guiding their physical forms into battle once more?\\" A wistful smile graced my features, my thoughts cascading back to the time I was merely a German ship operator and an actress, years before I had found a new existence. I remembered the pride of stepping aboard the formidable KMS Bismarck, the pinnacle of naval engineering of my time. How the atmosphere buzzed with anticipation and how the crew looked upon me as a mascot, a bearer of fortune for the naval colossus named after the Iron Chancellor himself. Little did we know that our voyage would be etched forever into the annals of history. \\"You've been awfully quiet,\\" Tirpitz interrupted my reverie, her voice soft yet carrying the usual bite I had come to love. \\"Reminiscing about 'the good old days' again, sister?\\" The corners of my mouth twitched up into a smirk. \\"I was merely thinking about choices and consequences,\\" I said before looking out onto the horizon stretched beyond the large windows of the command room. As the shipgirl embodiment of the Bismarck, I often found my thoughts straying back to my previous life. There was a peculiar melancholy in knowing the day the mighty Bismarck had been sunk by the combined forces of the Royal Navy... had been my last as a mortal. Sinking into the depths of the Atlantic, my consciousness somehow mingled with the very essence of the ship itself. \\"I heard from the Royal Navy girls that they held no personal grudge,\\" Queen Elizabeth chimed in, always so regal with her words and her demeanor. \\"Historical enmity fades in the face of our current fraternity, does it not?\\" \\"It does,\\" I conceded, locking eyes with the royal shipgirl, whose namesake once marshaled fleets against my former steel form. \\"Today, we stand united, not as enemies but as allies.\\" New Jersey, with her American bravado, grinned from beside us. \\"Guess we're all part of a bigger picture now. Ain't no room for old grudges when the world's counting on us to keep the peace.\\" Grudges, indeed, were luxuries of the past. For now, in this fleet called Azur Lane, we were comrades with a common goal: to protect humanity from threats beyond comprehension, those that sought to corrupt and destroy. I took a moment to appreciate the wide array of shipgirls surrounding me, each one a marvel of human and mysterious power. We had transcended history, and despite the chaos of war that had birthed us, we were now its staunchest guardians. The seas we sailed were no longer just battlegrounds—they were avenues of hope. And as the Iron Blood's flagship, I knew my anchor was set firm. Together with my allies, we would face whatever trials lay ahead, our strength and resolve unyielding as the steel of our namesakes. \\"Let's show them what we're made of,\\" I declared, my voice carrying through the fleet, a mix of human determination and the invincibility of a battleship. \\"Indeed, sister Bismarck,\\" Tirpitz replied with a nod. \\"Together, as one fleet, as one force, and as one family.\\" And so it was, the assembled might of the Azur Lane, with me, Bismarck, at its heart, ready to carve a new legacy across the oceans of the world."},{"instruction":"choose a random flower, two word only with the word flower","output":"Jasmine flower."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artJasmine flower.","output":"\\"Jasmine Flower | Elegant Botanical Art | Versatile Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Timeless Floral Decor | Gift Idea\\""},{"instruction":"A continuación te dare un contexto un rol una tarea y formato de respuesta.

The Special Fire Force [Fire Force] is instead a elite division of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army due to the Great Tokyo Empire's conquest, [the Special Fire Force in this story] being given authority to kill Infernals [Fire Force] as well as rouge Generations. Fusion of chakra with the world outside the Elemental Nation's pre-Great Cataclysm industrial processes allows for the mass production of the oversized, plasma beam-firing and nuclear missile equipped oversized fighter jets that can transform into massive humanoid mecha known as Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv], which [the Tactical Surface Fighters in this fanfic] became a important part of

This alternate Brittanian Empire joined the Central Powers in WW1 against a revanchist France, post-monarchic Britain and a Russian Tsardom looking for revenge [basically a WW1 version of WW2 Axis powers]in its homeworld and won alongside the other Central Powers, [This alternate Brittanian Empire in its home world after its home world's version of WW1] reclaiming the British Isles as well as parts of the French coast. It also seized control of European Russia in the 1950s A.D after the Brittanian royal family argued that the Romanovs marrying into them meant they had the right to rule Russia, facing heavy resistance from communists and Russian nationalists, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] twenty years before the events of canon Code Geass start is [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] pulled from its [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire's] original world and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] transported into the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki where the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten all [the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten] occur, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] replacing and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merging with [the nation-state this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire simultaneously replaces and merges with] the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal parliamentary monarchial theocratic crusader state of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten], which [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] is [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] also informally known as Lautreamont Knight Country [Seikoku no Doragunā] within this story with the Kingdom of Lescatie also being [what the Kingdom of Lescatie also is] known as the Tristain Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima], the Gallia Kingdom [the Zero no Tsukaima] or the Albion Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima] and the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this story's] official name [the Ordesian Empire] in this story as well. The Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this story also has the canon Lautreamont Knight Country's within the canon Seikoku no Doragunā's universe's tradition of dragon breeding and Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [Pals] used in warfare along with tanks, airplanes, modern naval power and floating battleships. The Ordesian Empire is also known as the Beltrum Kingdom in this fic [Seirei Gensōki] due to its [the Ordesian Empire's in this fic's] control of both the land and seas The Kingdom of Lescatie's territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie's] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world's version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic-equivalent nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent. When this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire replaces and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merges with the version of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic, it [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] inherits the Kingdom of Lescatie's [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic's conventional military and naval forces along with its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] forces and [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] resources, with people in this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire merging with their counterparts in the Kingdom of Lescatie in this fic when the transplacement [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire to the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki] and subsequent merger [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire with the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic].

He was Kazuki Ōtsutsuki, the Emperor of the Neo-Japanese Empire—unbeknownst to his subjects, a scion of both the Jurai and the celestial clan that fled to earth from the ravages of interdimensional strife. The morning air buzzed with the electricity of a dire council. \\"What news do we have from the outer provinces?\\" Kazuki asked, his voice commanding silence from the eclectic assembly of generals, samurai, and armed detectives before him. Shadows danced behind the stoic expressions of the council members. \\"My Emperor,\\" began General Amateru, a descendant of the legendary Sun Goddess. \\"The Meta Liberation Army is no more. Our Tactical Surface Fighters routed them at Osaka—without their Quirk supremacy, they crumbled.\\" His fingers brushed the pommel of his sword, his eyes revealing a chaotic dance of flame. Kazuki inclined his head, approval in his gaze. \\"Then we focus on consolidation. The Dragon Archipelago has been silent for too long.\\" The room stirred, whispers melding into the echo of dragon roars and elemental chants. A woman stepped forward, the emblem of the Special Fire Force bright upon her chest. Captain Hikari, wielder of Blue Flame, said with conviction, \\"My units stand ready. The pyrokinetics under my command hunger for Infernals to quench their fire.\\" Another figure now emerged from the gathered officials, an elderly man with the bearing of ancient authority. Ex-Shogun Tokugawa, his role now more ceremonial, steeped in the echoes of a Shinto past, nodded gravely. \\"And I shall see to the spirits. The cooperation between our Divas and your mighty army will see us triumphant.\\" Kazuki’s eyes, ever fierce, softened for a moment. \\"Your wisdom sees beyond the veil of years. Together, we ensure that our Empire's restoration is unchallenged.\\" Just as the conference was drawing to a close, a ripple of otherworldly energy washed over the chamber. From the northern sky, a vortex twisted into being, shimmering with the colors of an unseen spectrum. \\"What sorcery is this?\\" demanded a summoner, her hand gripping the hilt of her blade. Kazuki felt a tug at the edges of his spirit—a pull towards destiny that could not be ignored. Before the startled eyes of his council, the Emperor stepped towards the vortex. \\"Ready the IS units and the Stratos fleet. Prepare to face whatever lies beyond.\\" **Chapter Two: Dynasty of Dragons** The transition between worlds was as seamless as crossing the threshold of a shoji door. The Imperial forces found themselves in a land rich with heritage and tumultuous history, where Pal riders soared the skies, and elements themselves were harnessed by mortal will. They had arrived amidst a grand convergence, a clash between monmosu, elemental benders, and knights from legend and lore, their battles raging across the hills and forests of an empire that seemed oddly familiar—The Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu. As the infantry, mecha, and witches of the era descended upon the amalgamated world, delegates from the transported Holy Britannian Empire made contact. Against a backdrop of magically floating battleships, Kazuki met with the Britannian Sovereign, a ruler commanding legions and loyalty with equal fervor. The Brittanian monarch spoke: \\"An Emperor, you say? We both seem victims of cosmic jests. An empire with your might could serve well as allies against the crusader state we have come to replace.\\" Kazuki gave nothing away. \\"Alliances are formed on the anvil of necessity and tempered in the fires of shared ambition.\\" In the days following, the Neo-Japanese Empire, the amalgam empires, and Britannia found common toils, each bringing forth their might to meld into a new order—a balance of dragons and knights, witches and summoners, of skies torn asunder by machines of war and magic. **Chapter Three: Crystalline Convergence** Barely weeks had passed when word came of two new powers—the copied embodiments of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund—arriving in this realm of united fates. They carried with them the splintered histories of their world, a Europe unscarred by the BETA scourge, prosperous yet unknowingly transposed. It was the convergence of technological prowess and strategic might with the mystique of the old and the arcane that struck an unparalleled chord. The steel of Germanic ingenuity would join with the eternal flames of dragons, under skies crisscrossed by enchanted broomsticks and roaring jet engines. As representatives of each world met under a cease-fire banner, they pondered the implications. \\"We may not understand the full extent of our intertwining destinies,\\" mused an Austrian marshal. \\"But together, we are a force that can command both time and tide.\\" Kazuki, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with his newfound peers, let a rare smile touch his lips. \\"Let the records show that upon this day, we united not just our forces, but our aspirations. May our empire span not just worlds but the very stars.\\" The empire they would forge from the scattered remnants of legacies past would be like no other—an eternal symphony of firepower and enchantment, industry and artistry, bound together by the unbreakable will of those destined to rule the realms. Thus began an era of unparalleled prosperity and power. The collision of destinies had birthed an empire reborn, timeless and transcendent, where magic and might were twined inseparably, guided by the steady hand of a celestial lineage rooted deeply in the history of the heavens and the earth."},{"instruction":"Please help me find and fix mistake in Python script for speech recognition.

This sets the recording duration to \`10\` seconds multiplied by the sample rate \`fs\`. To fix the script so it records until the user presses Enter to stop, you need to modify the script to record in a non-blocking way and check for input asynchronously. Here's a modified version of the \`record_audio\` function: \`\`\`python import sounddevice as sd from scipy.io.wavfile import write import speech_recognition as sr import os import threading # Function to record audio def record_audio(filename): fs = 44100 # Sample rate print('Recording… Press Enter to stop.') # Start recording in a non-blocking way myrecording = sd.rec(samplerate=fs, channels=2, dtype='int16', blocking=False) # A simple function to wait for Enter press def wait_for_enter(): input() sd.stop() # Stop the recording # Start the wait_for_enter function in a separate thread t = threading.Thread(target=wait_for_enter) t.start() t.join() # Wait for the thread to finish, i.e., for Enter to be pressed # Save the recorded data that has been buffered until now write(filename, fs, myrecording) # The rest of your program remains the same # Main function entry point if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` With these changes, the script starts recording in a non-blocking way and then starts a separate thread to wait for the Enter key. When Enter is pressed, the \`wait_for_enter\` function calls \`sd.stop()\`, stopping the recording. Meanwhile, the recording continues until it is explicitly stopped. After stopping the recording, the audio data buffered up to that point is saved to the specified file. Remember that with this approach, there might be a small delay between the point when Enter is pressed and when recording actually stops because of buffering and thread scheduling. This should not be a significant issue for most use cases, but if precise timing is crucial, you may need a more sophisticated approach."},{"instruction":"Bitcoin is the most important invention in human history\\" change quetion version","output":"Is Bitcoin the most significant invention in human history?"},{"instruction":"У меня есть возможность рассылки в боте.

I would love to hear about the main premise of your manga. Feel free to share the details about the world, the characters, the overarching storyline, and the themes you're planning to explore. If you have specific aspects you'd like feedback on or questions about, let me know, and I'll do my best to provide helpful input."},{"instruction":"So… It’s about a brother and a sister running away from home because their parents’ marriage is falling apart. It’s summer and the story takes places over 3 months, June, July and August.","output":"That's a powerful and relatable foundation for a story. Exploring themes of family, relationships, and the impact of a marital crisis through the eyes of children can offer readers a lot of emotional depth. Here are a few aspects you might want to consider or include in your manga: 1. **Character Development**: The brother and sister will likely grow and change significantly over these three months. You could explore how the stress of their parents' situation affects them and how their journey away from home might force them to mature quickly or view the world differently. 2. **Setting**: Since the story spans summer months, the setting can influence the narrative. Their environment could range from urban adventures to rural escapism, each offering its own challenges and opportunities for growth. 3. **Plot**: What are the specific conflicts and challenges they face on their journey? Do they have a destination in mind, or are they aimlessly wandering? Their experiences on the road, the people they meet, and the situations they encounter could all play a role in shaping the story. 4. **Themes**: Beyond the obvious theme of family turmoil, you might explore themes of independence, coming of age, resilience in the face of adversity, and the search for belonging or stability. 5. **Visual Style**: The art in manga is as critical as the story itself. Your visual style can reflect the emotional tone of the manga – whether it's more realistic or stylized, bright and colorful to reflect summer vibes, or uses a more muted color palette to reflect the somber mood of the siblings' circumstances. 6. **Resolution**: Consider how you want the story to end. Will there be reconciliation within the family? Will the siblings find a new sense of home or family on their own terms? Or is the ending more open, reflecting the uncertainty of life? Remember, manga often resonates with readers due to the raw emotional honesty and depth of character interaction. Be sure to give the reader a clear sense of the siblings' personalities and inner thoughts – perhaps through introspective moments, flashbacks, or conversations with new friends or each other. In crafting your manga, it's also essential to research and ensure that the portrayal of sensitive subjects, like the impact of divorce on children, is handled with care and empathy. Feel free to share more details or ask for specific advice, and best of luck with your creative endeavor!"},{"instruction":"They live in Seattle and their destination is their grandparents’ place in Miami. Their journey is via a motorcycle, a red 1992 Harley Davidson Fat Boy with a flame livery. They decide to stop by Nevada and Arizona to see some interesting places.","output":"The cross-country journey from Seattle to Miami offers so much potential for rich storytelling. Traveling by motorcycle adds a layer of adventure and freedom to the narrative, and the specific choice of a red 1992 Harley Davidson Fat Boy with flame livery conjures a vivid image that readers can latch onto. Here are some points and ideas you might consider: 1. **Road Trip Imagery**: The visuals of a road trip provide ample opportunity for stunning, dynamic artwork. Depicting the diverse landscapes—from the Pacific Northwest's greenery, through the deserts of Nevada and Arizona, to the tropical climate of Florida—will be vital in establishing the atmosphere. 2. **Travel Challenges**: A motorcycle trip across the country will undoubtedly come with its own set of challenges. Weather conditions, mechanical issues, and the physical toll of a long journey on two young people would be realistic complications they might face. 3. **Sightseeing and Symbolism**: Choosing what places they want to see in Nevada and Arizona can offer more than just moments of leisure. These stops could symbolize the characters' growth and their mental state. For instance, the vast openness of the Grand Canyon might represent the breadth of the life choices before them. 4. **Relationship Dynamics**: The close proximity on a motorcycle journey could either bring the siblings closer together or heighten tensions between them. It's a great setup for exploring their relationship dynamics, including how they deal with their familial issues and support each other. 5. **Encounters Along the Way**: The people they meet can serve as mirrors to their struggles or provide alternative perspectives on life. For example, meeting other travelers or locals with their own stories can give them insights into their own situation. 6. **Logistics**: Since they're underage, there would be practical obstacles to traveling such a long distance alone—handling money, finding lodging, and staying safe. This can lead to creative storytelling as they figure out how to navigate these challenges. 7. **The Grandparents' Role**: Ultimately, the grandparents could represent a safe haven or a touchstone to a different way of life. How they factor into the story—who they are, what they believe, and how they react to the children's arrival—can be crucial to the resolution. 8. **Character Flashbacks/Foreshadowing**: Throughout the journey, you can utilize flashbacks to their life in Seattle to provide contrast or occasional glimpses into the type of conflict that spurred them to leave. Also, foreshadowing potential future conflicts or resolutions can keep the reader engaged. 9. **The Meaning of Home**: As the siblings journey from one home to another, their concept of what “home” means could evolve. This can be a central theme, explored through their conversation, interactions, and the emotional highs and lows of their adventure. The fact that the story takes place over summer can be symbolic of transition—the time between ending one school year and starting another—much like the siblings are in a transitionary phase of their lives, moving from the known to the unknown. Remember to also consider the pacing of your manga. The journey, its episodic nature as they travel from place to place, and the overall narrative arc should work in tandem, allowing the story enough breath to dive into deep, introspective moments while still keeping the plot moving forward. This premise holds a lot of promise, and you're in a great position to tell a moving and visually captivating story with your manga."},{"instruction":"They brought a weeks’ worth of snacks and drinks, the rest is either bought from random stores or having a nice dinner at a random diner in the middle of nowhere. Money is not worth of the issue, because the older sister brought a tin can filled with around 2000 dollars. The 2000 dollars was from the money she used to buy her Harley, around 4000 dollars.","output":"The setup you've provided offers a good foundation for a self-sufficient journey that relies on the resourcefulness and independence of the siblings. Having a budget of 2000 gives them some leeway but also introduces the need for careful spending, which can add an element of budgeting and financial management to their story. Here are several points to consider based on this setup: 1. **Budgeting Themes**: Managing their resources becomes a quiet subplot. The older sister's decision to use half of her savings shows a commitment to this escape plan and underscores its importance to her. However, the need to save and spend wisely can create moments of tension and decision-making that could stress their relationship or bring them closer as they cooperate and plan. 2. **Chance Encounters**: Stopping at random stores or diners can introduce a variety of characters, from quirky shopkeepers to other travelers. These meetings can flesh out the world and provide opportunities to explore different slices of life while influencing the siblings' perspectives and choices. 3. **Strategic Stops**: While some of their stops might be random or based on need, they may also plan to visit specific attractions or landmarks. This can help build anticipation and structure within the narrative. How they choose these stops and the experiences they have at each one can add depth to their characters. 4. **Consequences of a Pinched Budget**: At some point, they might face a financial crunch, whether it's due to an unexpected expense (like motorcycle repairs) or simply running lower on funds than anticipated. This presents an opportunity for character growth as they figure out how to overcome these hurdles. 5. **Survival Skills**: They'll learn how to get by on limited means, which could involve bargain hunting, camping out under the stars to save on accommodation, or taking on odd jobs if needed. These scenarios can add variety to the story, teaching them and readers about resourcefulness. 6. **Money and Values**: As the older sister initially intended to use the money for her Harley, and now they're spending it on this journey instead, this could be a reflection of what she values more. It can be a point of introspection or conversation between the siblings—how sometimes experiences and relationships are more important than material possessions. 7. **Emotional Stability**: Having provisions with them might give a sense of security that they are in control at least partially, in contrast to the chaos of their family life. Small rituals, like choosing where to eat or selecting snacks, could create a sense of normalcy. 8. **Perspective on Money**: They might come to learn that money is not the most important thing. Encounters with others who are content with less, or finding joy in the small, inexpensive experiences, could shift their understanding of what brings happiness. 9. **Economic Reality**: They might observe different economic realities as they travel from affluent areas to places that are more economically deprived. These can be opportunities to touch on social commentary. Incorporating these aspects can create a textured and multi-layered story, giving depth to the siblings' physical and emotional journey. Keep in mind that even though they have these funds, money can't solve all problems, and it's their ingenuity, emotional growth, and the bonds they forge that will ultimately carry them through the challenges of their adventure."},{"instruction":"Our two main siblings are Elena and David. Elena is 19 and went to community college. David is 14 and just finished 6th grade. There are mentions of a 3rd sibling but the only thing known about him is that he is going to flight school.","output":"Elena and David's characters present a dynamic range for storytelling due to their age difference and distinct life stages. Elena, on the cusp of true adulthood, possibly faces uncertainty about her future after community college, while David is in the throes of adolescence and dealing with the complexities of teenage life. The mention of a third sibling who is in flight school adds another dimension to the family dynamic and backstory. Here's how you could flesh out these characters and their journey: 1. **Elena's Responsibility**: Being the eldest and legally an adult, Elena may feel a strong sense of responsibility for David's well-being. This can lead to a protective nature but also to conflict if David seeks more independence. 2. **David's Admiration and Rebellion**: David likely looks up to his older sister, and this adventure could be seen as a grand escape in his eyes. However, given his age, he might also be grappling with the desire to assert his own identity, which could lead to moments of rebellion against Elena's decisions. 3. **Shared History and Secrets**: Their shared experience of their parents' marriage problems and the decision to leave home can be a source of bonding. They might have shared secrets and an unspoken understanding that strengthens their relationship during the trip. 4. **Personal Growth**: Both siblings are at pivotal moments of personal development. Elena might be contemplating her next life steps post-community college, and David is navigating early adolescence. The journey would give them time and experiences to reflect on who they are and who they want to become. 5. **Third Sibling's Influence**: The absence of the sibling in flight school can affect Elena and David in many ways. He might be an aspirational figure, or his absence during a critical family time might foster feelings of abandonment or resentment. 6. **Differing Perspectives on Family Dynamics**: With the age gap, Elena and David may have different understandings and perspectives of their parents' marital troubles. Elena might have a more nuanced take, while David could see things in a more black-and-white manner. 7. **Education and Dreams**: Elena's community college background might influence her practical approach to problems, and David's school experiences could color his worldview and reactions. Their educational pursuits—or lack thereof for David at this formative stage—may influence how they engage with the world around them. 8. **Coping Mechanisms**: Depending on their personalities, Elena and David might cope with their parents' situation differently. One might be more internal and reflective, while the other could be more outwardly expressive or even act out. 9. **The Missing Sibling's Shadow**: Elena and David's decisions during the journey might be influenced by their thoughts on what their absent brother would do or think, with his life path contrasting sharply with their own more erratic journey. 10. **Role Models**: They will likely meet various adults on their travels. How they interact with these figures could range from seeing them as surrogates to contrasting them with their parents or flight school sibling. 11. **Bonding Through Adversity**: The challenges they face on the road could strengthen their bond as siblings, especially as they have only each other to rely on in unfamiliar places and situations. Incorporating these nuances will not only enrich the primary relationship between Elena and David but also provide depth to the family dynamic, even with the third sibling off-page. The siblings' individual arcs and collective journey offer a canvas to explore an array of emotional, developmental, and thematic elements within your manga."},{"instruction":"Elena has blonde hair often tied in a ponytail and hazel eyes. She wears a black leather jacket, blue jeans and boots. When she's riding her motorcycle, she wears, gloves, goggles and a black crash helmet with a flame livery. She is often rebellious and bored. She is tall, skinny and she wears ripped jeans because of the hot weather.","output":"Your description of Elena paints a clear picture of a strong, independent, and possibly tough personality, which is reinforced by her attire and the aesthetic choices you've made for her. Here are some story elements and characteristics you could consider based on the description: 1. **Rebellious Nature**: Elena's rebellion can stem from a variety of factors: it could be a response to her family's situation, a general dissatisfaction with the direction of her own life, or a deeper quest for personal freedom. 2. **Boredom as a Motivator**: If Elena is often bored, this trip could represent a search for excitement and meaning. Her boredom could push her to take risks and seek new experiences, which would be an integral part of the journey's narrative. 3. **Physical Appearance and Personality Match**: Her tall and skinny frame, combined with a no-nonsense practicality reflected in her clothes, suggests a person who's ready to spring into action. The ripped jeans, chosen for comfort in the heat, still align with her rebellious image. 4. **Motorcycle Gear**: The specifics of her riding gear – gloves, goggles, and a helmet with flame livery – not only serve a practical purpose but also reinforce her edgy style. They can become symbolic of her protective shell, both physically as she rides and emotionally as she faces the world. 5. **Interactions with Others**: Elena's appearance and demeanor will likely affect how others perceive and interact with her. As the story progresses, characters she meets might challenge her preconceptions and help her uncover layers of herself she hasn't explored. 6. **Leader and Protector**: Elena's ensemble marks her as the leader and protector of this duo. This responsibility could be a significant aspect of her character development as she has to continuously navigate challenges while ensuring both their safeties. 7. **Contrast with David**: Considering her description, there's likely a visual and stylistic contrast between Elena and her younger brother David. This contrast can be used to emphasize their differing personalities and approaches to life. 8. **Casual Confidence**: The choice in clothing and physical demeanor could also signify a casual confidence – someone who doesn't need to try too hard to assert her presence. This might be juxtaposed with inner doubts or vulnerability that she tries to hide from her brother and others. 9. **Impact of Weather**: The changing climates they encounter on their journey from Seattle to Miami could affect how Elena dresses and presents herself, and those adjustments can be used to signify her adaptation to new environments and circumstances. 10. **The \\"Tough Girl\\" with Depth**: While Elena’s external image may be that of the classic \\"tough girl,\\" as the story unfolds, you have the opportunity to explore the complexities that lie beneath her rough exterior, showing a multifaceted character who is resilient yet capable of emotional depth. Your visualization of Elena is vivid and already suggests an interesting backstory and personality that readers can root for and connect with. As with any character-driven narrative, take the time to explore Elena's motivations, fears, and desires, which will bring authenticity and relatability to her character and make the story resonate with your audience."},{"instruction":"Create gmb post use keyrd in the 100 wrds post description not in title make title enganging and here is the refrence foole same style 100 wrds each simple english - Keyword: Managed Service Providers Irvine Title: Improve Your Tech Experience with Managed Service Providers Is managing your technology resources becoming overwhelming?

The \`frames\` parameter determines how many samples are recorded. Without specifying \`frames\`, the \`sounddevice\` library cannot allocate a buffer to store the recorded audio data. To fix the error, you need to specify the number of frames. Generally, this is calculated based on the recording duration and the sample rate (fs). In most cases, you would decide how long you want the recording to be. Here's how you could modify your \`record_audio\` function: \`\`\`python import sounddevice as sd from scipy.io.wavfile import write import os import threading # Function to record audio def record_audio(filename, duration=None): fs = 44100 # Sample rate print('Recording… Press Enter to stop.') # If duration is specified, calculate frames accordingly if duration is not None: frames = int(fs * duration) else: frames = None # We need to update our logic to handle this case # Execute the recording with sd.InputStream(samplerate=fs, channels=2, dtype='int16') as stream: myrecording = [] # A simple function to record audio until duration or Enter press def callback(indata, frames, time, status): if status: print(status) myrecording.extend(indata.copy()) # Start recording in a non-blocking way with sd.InputStream(callback=callback, channels=2, dtype='int16', samplerate=fs): if frames is not None: sd.sleep(duration * 1000) else: input() # Wait for Enter to be pressed if no duration is given sd.stop() # Stop the recording anyway # Save the recorded data as a numpy array myrecording_array = np.array(myrecording) write(filename, fs, myrecording_array) # Rest of your code remains same... \`\`\` Here, I added a \`duration=None\` parameter to the \`record_audio\` function, which allows you to optionally specify the recording duration (in seconds). If the duration is not specified, the code waits for an Enter keypress as it did before. Make sure you add the necessary import for the numpy module at the start of the script: \`\`\`python import numpy as np \`\`\` Note that I've also changed the audio recording approach to use \`sd.InputStream\` in combination with a callback function to accumulate the recorded frames. This method allows for more flexibility and naturally handles the case where no frames argument is provided. With this code, if no duration is specified, the \`callback\` function will keep collecting the samples every time it is called until you press Enter. Then, it stops and concatenates all recorded frames into an array and saves them to the file. Please adjust the logic as per your requirements if you need to wait for an Enter press to stop the recording at any time. **Important:** It's worth noting that in this case the recording stops immediately after entering the command, without waiting for the Enter key if a duration is given. This is a simplified example; the actual recording logic can be combined with the Enter keypress logic for a more user-driven control over the recording duration."},{"instruction":"Create gmb post use keyrd in the 100 wrds post description not in title make title enganging and here is the refrence foole same style 100 wrds each simple english - Keyword: Managed Service Providers Irvine Title: Improve Your Tech Experience with Managed Service Providers Is managing your technology resources becoming overwhelming?

Однако, вы можете использовать сторонние библиотеки для данной задачи. Один из способов - использовать библиотеку для C#, которая может работать в Unity и поддерживает конвертацию PDF в изображения. Пример такой библиотеки - \`Pdfium\` или \`iTextSharp\`. Оба этих решения могут потребовать дополнительных настроек и лицензирования, особенно если вы планируете использовать их в коммерческих продуктах. Вот общие шаги реализации конвертации PDF в JPG в Unity с использованием сторонней библиотеки: 1. Найдите и загрузите библиотеку, подходящую для работы с PDF в Unity. Убедитесь, что она совместима с вашей версией Unity и платформой, на которой вы планируете запускать ваше приложение. 2. Импортируйте библиотеку в Unity, поместив необходимые DLL файлы в папку Assets/Plugins. 3. Напишите скрипт для конвертации PDF в JPG. Вот примерный код на C#, который использует фиктивную библиотеку \`PdfToJpgConverter\` для иллюстрации: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using System.Collections; using SomePdfToJpgConverterLibrary; public class PdfToJpgConverter : MonoBehaviour { public TextAsset pdfFile; // PDF файл в формате TextAsset public Texture2D convertedJpgTexture; // Сюда мы поместим сконвертированное изображение void Start() { StartCoroutine(ConvertPdfToJpg()); } IEnumerator ConvertPdfToJpg() { // Преобразование TextAsset в массив байтов byte[] pdfBytes = pdfFile.bytes; // Возможно, вам потребуется асинхронно запустить конвертирование в зависимости от библиотеки // Псевдокод для вызова конвертации через стороннюю библиотеку byte[] jpgBytes = PdfToJpgConverterLibrary.ConvertPdfToJpg(pdfBytes); // Создание текстуры из массива байтов JPG convertedJpgTexture = new Texture2D(2, 2); // размеры нужно будет настроить в соответствии с изображением convertedJpgTexture.LoadImage(jpgBytes); // загрузка изображения // После завершения конвертации можно использовать convertedJpgTexture, например, присвоить её материалу yield return null; } } \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что существует множество различных библиотек для работы с PDF, и код выше является гипотетическим примером. Вам нужно будет найти и изучить документацию к выбранной библиотеке, чтобы узнать, как использовать её для конвертации PDF в JPG. 4. Убедитесь, что у вас есть право на использование библиотеки в рамках вашего проекта, проверьте условия лицензирования. 5. Протестируйте работу сконвертированных изображений в вашем приложении на Unity, убедитесь, что конвертация происходит корректно, и изображения отображаются напрямую или сохраняются на диск соответствующим образом. Также стоит учитывать, что Unity преимущественно используется для разработки игр и интерактивных приложений, и не обязательно является лучшим выбором для решения таких задач, как обработка и конвертация PDF-документов. Возможно, будет лучше обработать PDF и конвертировать его в JPG вне Unity, а результаты уже импортировать в движок для дальнейшего использования."},{"instruction":"Happy","output":"Hello!

Use the article to guide you: he danger of failing to interpret and contextualize the CED September 19, 2023 The AP Chemistry Course & Exam Description (CED) is the document that tells teachers the content can be examined on the AP Chemistry exam in May of each year. As an AP Chemistry teacher, the CED is the single most important guide to the teaching of the course, so when questions arise about what content is in – and just as importantly what content is out – is it just as simple as searching the CED to find the relevant phrase? Unfortunately, the answer is no. I often see AP Chemistry teachers ask questions such as, “Should I teach combustion analysis” followed by, “I searched the CED and couldn’t find it”. Well, be careful! There’s a real danger in searching that document and drawing the conclusion that if a particular phrase is not present then that means a topic is not examinable. The simple explanation of the disconnect lies in interpretation and context. Let’s take combustion analysis as an example. The better question to ask about teaching it is, “Would teaching combustion analysis involve the calculation of moles, the application of stoichiometry, and the possible calculation of empirical and/or molecular formula?” Well, I think we all know the answer to those questions, and hence combustion analysis’s potential relevance to an AP chemistry course. A similar (but different) example is the question of teaching paramagentism and diamagnetism. I have dealt with that question here. In this instance the conversation revolves around the way that LOs connected with electronic configuration might be interpreted beyond the literal. I have a simple test for this. I ask myself, “If a question about [blank] came up on the exam, would I feel it “unfair”?” With paramagnetism I would not, so it’s “in” for me. It should be noted that teaching something like paramagnetism is such a low impact topic in terms of time and deviation from what I have to teach about electronic configuration anyway, that it’s almost a nothing-burger, and perhaps time might make a difference in other examples. Finally I deal with balancing REDOX in acid and base here. This treatment is similar to that related to paramagnetism in as much as it involves an interpretation of LOs rather than their literal reading, but also goes further. I feel there is just too much value in teaching balancing REDOX in acid and base for other areas of the course for it to be ignored. It’s still true that the literal reading of the CED is vital, but so are these other ways to consume it. In the first instance combustion is essentially just another name for a bunch of things that are explicitly listed in the CED; the second example is a “safety first” approach, where a wider interpretation of the application of LOs means that I teach something that I feel feasibly could be examined; and thirdly there’s an example of a topic that I don’t think will be examined literally, but offers way too much value across other areas of the examinable curriculum for it to be omitted. Each of these is subtlety different, but each offers a window into the CED that goes beyond just “Ctrl+F”. Required Course Content: TOPIC 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M","output":"Based on the provided article and the required course content, here is a plan of what to teach when covering Topic 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass in an AP Chemistry class: 1. Introduction to Moles - Explain the concept of the mole as a unit that allows chemists to count particles indirectly. - Discuss Avogadro’s number and its significance in chemistry. 2. Molar Mass - Show how to calculate the molar mass of a substance from its formula. - Emphasize the numerical equality between the average mass of one particle in amu and the molar mass of the substance in grams. 3. Dimensional Analysis and Mole Concept - Teach students how to use dimensional analysis to convert between grams, moles, and number of particles. - Work through several examples to ensure students are comfortable with the calculations. 4. Real-world Applications and Implications - Illustrate the connection between the theoretical concepts and laboratory work, such as determining the mass of reactants and products. - Explain the importance of the mole in stoichiometric calculations and empirical/molecular formula determination, which is relevant to combustion analysis as mentioned in the article. 5. Contextualizing and Applying Knowledge - Discuss how the specific learning objectives and essential knowledge from the CED can be applied to topics like combustion analysis, even if they are not explicitly mentioned. - Introduce additional topics like paramagnetism and diamagnetism, and REDOX reactions in acid and base to demonstrate how to make broader connections from the CED, enhancing students' ability to solve different types of chemistry problems. 6. Exploring Related Concepts - Without deviating from the essential content, explore related concepts that support the learning objectives, such as empirical and molecular formulas, to ensure students are well-prepared for potential exam questions. 7. Practice and Assessment - Provide a variety of practice problems that involve calculating moles, molar mass, and using the mole concept. - Assess students' understanding through quizzes, assignments, and lab activities that require the application of the learned concepts. By following this plan, you will be addressing the required course content while also providing a deeper understanding of the topics and their relevance in chemistry through interpretation and contextualization as endorsed by the article. The overarching goal is to prepare students for the AP Chemistry exam by ensuring that they have a solid grasp of the examinable content and the skills to apply their knowledge to any related topic that may be explored."},{"instruction":"Best","output":"It seems you may have accidentally submitted an incomplete question.

It is important to ensure that the \`soap_request\` XML is correctly formatted and matches the expected input for the web service operation. From your provided documentation, it seems you have populated the XML with your specific values (like \`<port>52233</port>\` and \`<serverApplicationInstance>830af0c3-4fa7-4efd-ac27-0a86bc69803f</serverApplicationInstance>\`), which is good as long as these values are correct for your use case. 2. The response parsing function \`extract_data_from_response(response)\` expects specific tag names such as \`<SFDConnectRequest>\`. You need to make sure these tag names match exactly with what the actual SOAP response XML contains. Otherwise, the \`find\` methods will return \`None\`. 3. It's best practice to handle the case where elements are not found in the response, to avoid \`AttributeError\` when calling \`.text\` on \`None\`. 4. You also need to ensure that the namespaces are correctly defined and match the namespaces used in the SOAP response. For example, if the actual response uses a different namespace prefix or URI, you'll need to update your \`namespaces\` dictionary accordingly. 5. The \`Content-Length\` header normally does not need to be set manually when using the \`requests\` library, as it is calculated and added automatically. 6. Although it might not cause an issue, the \`Content-Length\` in the headers is set based on the initial length of \`soap_request\`. If there are any changes during the request, this could technically become incorrect. Let the \`requests\` library handle this unless you have a specific reason to set it manually. 7. If SSL/TLS is used, you should change \`http\` to \`https\` in your \`soap_url\`. Since I cannot see the actual response from the server, I cannot confirm that your parsing logic is appropriate. Therefore, it's important to check if the tags you're looking for actually exist in the SOAP response you receive. You've done a good job of structuring the code and following the provided documentation. However, it's crucial to test the entire flow to ensure it works as expected from sending the request to parsing the response. In conclusion, always perform end-to-end testing with the actual SOAP service to confirm that the request is correct and that the data extraction from the response works correctly. If you encounter issues or errors, you may need to adjust the code according to the specifics of the SOAP service and response."},{"instruction":"Declare a number to infinity in python","output":"In Python, there is no direct way to represent an actual infinity numerical value as you might in a mathematical sense. However, Python's \`float\` type has a constant that can be used to represent infinity: \`float('inf')\` for positive infinity and \`float('-inf')\` for negative infinity. This is a result of the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which Python adheres to. Here is how you can declare a positive and negative infinity in Python: \`\`\`python positive_infinity = float('inf') negative_infinity = float('-inf') # Example usage print(positive_infinity) # Prints: inf print(negative_infinity) # Prints: -inf # Checking if a number is greater than or less than infinity print(100 < positive_infinity) # True print(-100 > negative_infinity) # True # Operations with infinity print(positive_infinity + 1000) # Results in positive infinity print(positive_infinity * -1) # Results in negative infinity \`\`\` Remember that while you can use these representations in your calculations, they are still not actual infinite numbers and have their limitations and rules in the context of floating-point arithmetic. Also, Python offers \`math.inf\` as another way to represent positive infinity, starting with Python 3.5: \`\`\`python import math positive_infinity = math.inf print(positive_infinity) # Prints: inf \`\`\` Negative infinity can also be represented similarly using \`-math.inf\`."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept.

Your stats are as follows (consider these out of a total potential of 100 for simplicity): - Spell Complexity: 90 - Spell Originality: 85 - Magical Aesthetics: 88 - Spell Durability: 82 - Magical Charisma: 90 - Total Spell Points (TSP): 435 Lily, the 6-year-old challenger, has the following stats: - Spell Complexity: 9 - Spell Originality: 8.5 - Magical Aesthetics: 8.8 - Spell Durability: 8.2 - Magical Charisma: 9 - Total Spell Points (TSP): 43.5 The rules of the duel are clear: No repetitive spells, and the effectiveness of each spell in the duel will be judged for points based on the quality, creativity, and spectacle of the magic produced. You are aware that in terms of raw power and experience, you have the clear advantage, but you are about to face a duel unlike any before. With the traditional bow exchanged between you and Lily, the duel commences. Unbeknownst to you, Lily whispers an incantation before the first round, and the duel's difficulty escalates from a mere display of talent to a battle for your magical essence. Round 1 begins and you cast your first spell. Please announce your spell. (Note: With each spell you cast, I will narratively adjust your stats to reflect the changes caused by Lily's spell. The descriptions of Lily's spells and her increasing abilities will accompany your narrative.)"},{"instruction":"I try to cast Phoenix Fire","output":"As the first round sets the stage, you feel the familiar surge of power coursing through your veins. With a graceful flick of your wrist and a chant that resonates through the arena, you invoke the dazzling Phoenix Fire—a spell that conjures a magnificent ethereal phoenix whose fiery plumes paint the sky in a dance of blazing oranges and reds. It's a fan-favorite for its display of splendor and rebirth, and as the phoenix takes flight, the crowed is awestruck by the spectacle. However, as the spell reaches its crescendo, you feel a slight tingle of unfamiliar magic touch your soul. Unbeknownst to you, Lily's temporal alteration spell begins its work. **Sapphire's Adjusted Stats:** - Spell Complexity: 90 - 9 (new 81) - Spell Originality: 85 - 8.5 (new 76.5) - Magical Aesthetics: 88 - 8.8 (new 79.2) - Spell Durability: 82 - 8.2 (new 73.8) - Magical Charisma: 90 - 9 (new 81) - Total Spell Points (TSP): 435 - 43.5 (new 391.5) The crowd's reaction, matched with the judges’ scores, reflects the success of your casting. Your spell garners high points, setting a strong opening in the duel. Yet, there is a lingering sense of something amiss—a whisper of magic you can't quite grasp that leaves you feeling a year younger and tinged with a subtle loss of prowess. Little Lily steps forward, her small hands weaving through the air. She casts a spell called \\"Dewdrop Serenade,\\" producing a cascade of sparkling dewdrops that dance to an unheard melody, each droplet shimmering like a jewel in the light. The crowd watches with delight, but against the Phoenix Fire, it's clear that Lily's spell is not in the same league. Although, if you were to look closely, you'd swear she seems a bit taller than she did when the match began. As Lily's own stats now subtly increase: **Lily's Adjusted Stats:** - Spell Complexity: 9 + 0.9 (new 9.9) - Spell Originality: 8.5 + 0.85 (new 9.35) - Magical Aesthetics: 8.8 + 0.88 (new 9.68) - Spell Durability: 8.2 + 0.82 (new 9.02) - Magical Charisma: 9 + 0.9 (new 9.9) - Total Spell Points (TSP): 43.5 + 4.35 (new 47.85) With the first round completed and the second approaching, you must choose your next spell carefully. Your innate talent still gives you an edge, but the duel grows more uncertain as the rounds progress and the balance of power begins to shift. What spell will Sapphire cast next?"},{"instruction":"I try to cast Wolves of Frost","output":"With a steady breath to maintain your focus, you channel your energy into the arena once more. Your hands draw intricate symbols in the frost-laden air, summoning the majestic Wolves of Frost. From the ground up, ethereal wolves materialize, their bodies composed of crystalline ice and snowflakes. They move with liquid grace, leaving a trail of rime in their wake as they playfully roam the dueling platform. Their howls echo like a melody, intertwining with the gasps of the audience who shiver both from the drop in temperature and from the sheer beauty of the spectacle. The creation of these magical creatures is a testament to your prowess, yet with the casting of the spell, you feel another year slip away from you—another subtle reduction in your control and fluency of magic. In the eyes of the audience, your performance remains nearly flawless, but deep inside, you feel the difference. **Sapphire's Adjusted Stats:** - Spell Complexity: 81 - 9 (now 72) - Spell Originality: 76.5 - 8.5 (now 68) - Magical Aesthetics: 79.2 - 8.8 (now 70.4) - Spell Durability: 73.8 - 8.2 (now 65.6) - Magical Charisma: 81 - 9 (now 72) - Total Spell Points (TSP): 391.5 - 43.5 (now 348) The Wolves of Frost earn you a considerable amount of points, creating a more demanding act for Lily to follow. But with each of your spells, she grows slightly more formidable. Lily steps up, now slightly more composed and with a newfound confidence in her eyes. She gracefully lifts her hands and conjures a spell known as \\"Dance of the Golden Leaves.\\" From nothingness, golden leaves appear, twirling around the arena in a captivating whirlwind of color and light. They form patterns, swirl around her in an intricate ballet, and finally settle down gently on the floor, creating an image of a blooming autumn tree. The audience is charmed by the display, and the juxtaposition of fall’s warmth against your winter wolves is striking. **Lily's Adjusted Stats:** - Spell Complexity: 9.9 + 0.9 (now 10.8) - Spell Originality: 9.35 + 0.85 (now 10.2) - Magical Aesthetics: 9.68 + 0.88 (now 10.56) - Spell Durability: 9.02 + 0.82 (now 9.84) - Magical Charisma: 9.9 + 0.9 (now 10.8) - Total Spell Points (TSP): 47.85 + 4.35 (now 52.2) The duel is escalating, and you're beginning to sense that Lily's magic is growing stronger with each round. With round three approaching, it’s time for you to decide your next spell, knowing that your capabilities, while still strong, are silently fading. What will Sapphire cast to maintain her lead?"},{"instruction":"привет как в unity конвертировать pdf в jpg и открыть их","output":"В Unity нет встроенного способа для конвертирования PDF в JPG напрямую, потому что это игровой движок, ориентированный в основном на создание игр и интерактивных приложений. Однако, вы можете использовать сторонние библиотеки или инструменты для выполнения этой задачи вне Unity, а затем импортировать отконвертированные изображения обратно в Unity. Если вам необходимо сделать конвертацию внутри Unity, возможно, вам придётся интегрировать сторонние .NET библиотеки в ваш проект Unity, которые могут работать с PDF файлами. Одна такая библиотека - это iTextSharp, которая может использоваться для работы с PDF файлами. Тем не менее, для работы с изображениями, вы потребуетесь другую библиотеку, способную экспортировать или сохранять страницы как изображения. Примерный алгоритм действий будет выглядеть следующим образом: 1. Поиск подходящей библиотеки, которая может быть использована в Unity для обработки PDF и конвертирования их в изображения. 2. Интеграция этой библиотеки с Unity (возможно, потребуется обработка зависимостей и устранение конфликтов). 3. Написание скрипта на C#, который будет использовать функционал библиотеки для чтения PDF файла, его конвертации в изображение (или изображения) и сохранения результата. 4. Загрузка и отображение полученного изображения JPG в Unity с помощью компонента \`SpriteRenderer\`, \`RawImage\` или других методов визуализации, в зависимости от ваших потребностей. Имейте в виду, что работа с PDF может потребовать лицензирования, в зависимости от используемой библиотеки, поэтому всегда обращайте внимание на лицензионные соглашения. Для разовых конвертаций, вы можете использовать какое-либо веб-приложение или настольное ПО для конвертации PDF в JPG, затем экспортировать полученные JPG файлы в Unity и использовать их как обычные текстуры. Также важно отметить, что отладка и использование сторонних библиотек требует хорошего знания C# и умения решать проблемы с зависимостями и версиями .NET в контексте Unity. Если конкретная необходимость в использовании Unity отсутствует и задача заключается только в конвертации PDF в JPG, рекомендую использовать специализированные инструменты за пределами Unity."},{"instruction":"choose a random flower, two word only with the word flower","output":"Jasmine flower"},{"instruction":"spiega perché la dfs può non essere completa","output":"DFS, o Depth-First Search, è un algoritmo di ricerca nei grafi che procede esplorando il più possibile lungo ciascun ramo prima di fare backtracking. La completa in questo contesto significa che, se una soluzione esiste, l'algoritmo è garantito di trovarla. Tuttavia, DFS può non essere completa per diversi motivi: 1. Spazio di ricerca infinito: Se l'algoritmo DFS viene applicato a un albero infinito o a un grafo con cicli senza nessun controllo di evitamento dei cicli (come il controllo dei nodi già visitati), DFS può continuare all'infinito lungo un percorso senza mai trovare la soluzione, anche se essa esiste in un'altra parte del grafo. 2. Limitazione dello stack: DFS utilizza uno stack, che è una struttura dati di tipo LIFO (Last In, First Out), per tenere traccia dei nodi da esplorare. Nei sistemi reali, la dimensione dello stack è limitata e può esaurirsi se la profondità dell'albero è significativamente grande, portando all'arresto dell'esecuzione dello script a causa di un overflow dello stack. 3. Casi peggiori di performance: Mentre DFS può essere completo in grafi finiti e ciclici se attuato con un controllo dei nodi già visitati, in pratica, DFS può essere inefficiente per problemi di ricerca dove l'albero di ricerca è molto profondo oppure la soluzione si trova su un livello meno profondo, lontano dal ramo scelto per la discesa. In queste situazioni, DFS può impiegare molto tempo prima di riconsiderare altre alternative e, pur essendo teoricamente completa, può non riuscire a trovare una soluzione in un tempo ragionevole. 4. Selezione dei percorsi: La scelta dei percorsi che DFS fa durante la ricerca è determinata dall'ordine in cui i vicini vengono esplorati. Se questo ordine è sfavorevole, DFS può seguire una traccia lunga e improduttiva che ritarda il raggiungimento della soluzione. Per affrontare questi problemi e rendere la ricerca completa, l'algoritmo DFS può essere modificato o integrato con ulteriori strategie, come l'uso di una soglia di profondità con l'algoritmo DFS iterativo (IDDFS, Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search), che combina i vantaggi di DFS e BFS (Breadth-First Search), offrendo la completezza anche in spazi di ricerca enormi o infiniti."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept.

Whether you're looking to purchase a new home or sell your property, understanding the latest trends is crucial. Buyers and sellers need to be aware of what's happening around them to make informed decisions and to harness the potential of the market effectively. For sellers, one trend that has been noticeable is the go-digital approach. Gone are the days when the only way to market your home was through traditional methods like print ads and open houses. Now, sellers are utilizing online platforms, showcasing virtual tours, and even using social media to reach potential buyers. Staging a home properly, making necessary renovations, and being flexible with showing times can also impact the selling process positively. On the buyer's side, there's been a noticeable shift towards seeking more sustainable and technology-equipped homes. Energy efficiency, smart home features, and green spaces are becoming highly desirable qualities. Buyers are now more educated and have a plethora of online tools at their disposal to help them make smarter decisions. They are able to research neighborhoods, compare prices, and even get pre-approved for mortgages before setting foot inside a home. Local real estate agents play a pivotal role in both the buying and selling process. They're not just facilitators but trusted advisors who can offer a nuanced understanding of the market, negotiate deals and provide insights that are not readily available through online sources. Their expertise can be particularly invaluable when it comes to navigating through complex transactions or understanding the legal aspects of real estate. The traditional home-buying season starts in spring, but there's been a shift with markets staying active year-round, thanks to the virtual tools enabling property visits anytime, anywhere. This accessibility has created a more constant flow of property listings and sales. Besides, with more companies embracing remote work policies, buyers are no longer tethered to a specific location and can choose to live further away from their workplaces, potentially getting more value for their money. Mortgage rates are another critical factor for the buyer and seller market. Lower rates can incentivize buyers to take the leap and also result in a seller's market, where there are more buyers than available homes, which can drive up housing prices. Conversely, when rates are high, the market may cool down, prices can stabilize or decrease, and this might turn into a buyer's market. Current trends point toward both challenges and opportunities in the New York real estate market. A new home for sale in New York continues to have significant appeal for a variety of reasons—its vibrant culture, robust economy, and the prestige of owning property in one of the world's most renowned cities. However, given the density and demand of the area, the competition is fierce, and prices remain relatively high. Therefore, whether you're buying or selling in New York, an understanding of localized conditions and market nuances is imperative. For sellers in New York, understanding the target demographic is key. Are your potential buyers looking for family-friendly neighborhoods, or are they young professionals looking for a vibrant nightlife and proximity to work? Tailoring your selling strategy to the audience that is most likely to be interested in your property can go a long way. Buyers in New York should be prepared for a potentially fast-paced and competitive market. They might have to act quickly when they find the right new home for sale and should have their financial arrangements in order. They should also be open to exploring different neighborhoods they might not have initially considered to find better value or a growing community that could bring a good return on investment in the future. As real estate buyer and seller trends continue to evolve, both parties must stay informed, adapt their strategies, and seek professional advice when necessary. Whether you're buying your first home, seeking to upgrade, or looking to sell, the real estate market offers a wealth of opportunities for those who are ready to navigate it. In conclusion, the real estate industry is ever-changing, with trends that fluctuate based on economic, technological, and societal shifts. Both buyers and sellers need to stay agile, informed, and, if possible, seek the guidance of local real estate experts to navigate these waters. Understanding the current trends and preparing for them can help ensure a smoother and more successful real estate transaction. Whether it's selling a picturesque home in a bustling New York neighborhood or buying the home of your dreams in this iconic city, the right insights and actions can make all the difference in this significant life milestone."},{"instruction":"Blah","output":"Hello!

These slogans would reflect the unconventional and sometimes criticized designs of vehicles that were released around that time, along with the difficult financial situation GM faced: 1. General Motors: \\"Driving You into Tomorrow's Bankruptcy, Today!\\" - Meaning: Mocking the financial troubles of GM around 2009, while suggesting their vehicles were forward-thinking but fiscally unsustainable. 2. Chevy Clunkers: \\"We're Not Just a Car, We're a Tax Write-Off!\\" - Meaning: Referring to the vehicles eligible for the U.S. government's \\"Cash for Clunkers\\" program, satirically suggesting the cars were more valuable as a write-off than as a mode of transportation. 3. Pontiac Pastimes: \\"Vintage Design, Yesterday's Technology, Tomorrow's Relic.\\" - Meaning: Mocking Pontiac's outdated designs and lagging technological advancements contributing to the brand's demise (Pontiac was discontinued in 2010). 4. Gimmick Motors: \\"We Put the 'No' in Innovation!\\" - Meaning: Poking fun at GM's less successful attempts at innovation during a time when they may have been perceived as lagging behind competitors. 5. Hummer Hurdles: \\"Conquer Mountain Roads and Gas Station Lines.\\" - Meaning: Criticizing the impracticality and fuel inefficiency of Hummer vehicles, which were known to be gas guzzlers, during a time when fuel efficiency was becoming more important to consumers. 6. Saturn's Swan Song: \\"Out of This World Designs, Down to Earth Discontinuations.\\" - Meaning: Playing with Saturn's space-themed branding, referencing both their unique designs and market departure (the brand was phased out in 2010). 7. Cadillac Conundrums: \\"Where Luxury Meets Uncertainty.\\" - Meaning: Suggesting that the luxury brand is ironically paired with the uncertain times GM was facing financially and corporately at the time. 8. Buick Baffles: \\"Old World Charm, New World Confusion.\\" - Meaning: Alluding to Buick's reputation for attracting an older demographic while trying (and sometimes failing) to reinvent themselves for a younger market. Remember, these satirical slogans are purely fictional and meant for entertainment purposes. They are not representative of General Motors' actual branding or marketing strategies."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1987?","output":"Creating satirical slogans requires a bit of humor, an understanding of the context of the time, and some knowledge about the company and its products. In 1987, General Motors (GM) was known for producing vehicles that were sometimes criticized for their design, lack of innovation, or reliability issues when compared to their Japanese competitors. With that in mind, here are some tongue-in-cheek, satirical slogans that might reflect GM's divisions and the automotive climate of that era: 1. Chevrolet: \\"Chevrolet: Because when everything looks the same, you can't pick the wrong one.\\" 2. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac: You can't spell 'ostentatious' without 'C-A-D.' Luxuriously behind the times.\\" 3. Buick: \\"Buick: Float on the road and drift in time — back to 1975.\\" 4. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac: We build excitement... and then we kind of just stopped trying.\\" 5. Oldsmobile: \\"Oldsmobile: For those who've reached their destination. In life, and in automotive design.\\" 6. GMC: \\"GMC: Our trucks are like our designs — made to resist change.\\" 7. Saturn (introduced in 1990, but just for fun): \\"Saturn: A different kind of car company, same kind of 80s vibe.\\" 8. Geo (Brand by Chevrolet): \\"Geo: Because even Chevrolet needed a pseudonym in the 80s.\\" Please note that these slogans are made in good fun and are not representative of the actual slogans or mission statements of General Motors or its divisions. GM, like many car manufacturers, has experienced various periods of both criticism and praise throughout its history."},{"instruction":"Реши задачу. представь отрезок длиной 800 м,, слева из центра объект движется со скоростью 3 м/c с","output":"Чтобы решить задачу, нам потребуется понять в каком направлении движется объект и что значит \\"слева из центра\\". Предположим, что \\"слева из центра\\" означает, что объект начинает движение в центре отрезка и движется влево. Тогда центр отрезка длиной 800 м будет находиться на расстоянии 400 м от каждого конца. Если объект движется со скоростью 3 м/с влево, то время, которое потребуется ему, чтобы достичь левого конца отрезка, можно вычислить по формуле времени: [ время = frac{расстояние}{скорость} ] Так как расстояние от центра до края составляет 400 м, а скорость равна 3 м/с, время будет равно: [ время = frac{400 text{ м}}{3 text{ м/с}} = frac{400}{3} text{ с} ≈ 133.33 text{ с} ] Таким образом, объект достигнет левого конца отрезка примерно за 133.33 секунды."},{"instruction":"Реши задачу. представь отрезок длиной 800 м, слева в центр движется объекта скоростью 3 м/c , справа в центр движется объекта скоростью 5 м/c, по центру стоит флаг с вопросом.","output":"Чтобы решить эту задачу, нам нужно узнать, когда оба объекта встретятся у флага, если они начнут двигаться одновременно к центру отрезка. Предполагается, что отрезок длиной 800 метров поделен точкой с флагом пополам, так что два объекта находятся на равном расстоянии от центра, то есть каждый из них на расстоянии 400 м от флага. Пусть оба объекта начнут двигаться одновременно к центру отрезка, то есть к флагу. Объект, который движется со скоростью 3 м/с, пройдет расстояние до флага за время: t₁ = расстояние / скорость = 400 м / 3 м/с ≈ 133.33 секунды. Объект, движущийся со скоростью 5 м/с, пройдет расстояние до флага за время: t₂ = расстояние / скорость = 400 м / 5 м/с = 80 секунд. Так как объекты двигаются к центру, рассматриваемый случай подразумевает, что время, за которое объекты встретятся у флага, будет определяться объектом, который доходит до флага дольше, т.е. объектом, который движется со скоростью 3 м/с. Итак, они встретятся у флага приблизительно через 133.33 секунды после начала движения, потому что за это время объект, движущийся медленнее, преодолеет необходимое расстояние до флага. Объект, движущийся быстрее, за это время преодолеет большее расстояние (он пройдет 400 м за 80 секунд, и у него останется еще 53.33 секунды, чтобы двигаться мимо флага, если бы задача этого не запрещала).

Я позвонила, чтобы уточнить этот вопрос, мне сказали, что цена фиксированная и больше ни за что платить не придется. Когда заключали договор, в нем тоже была указана заявленная стоимость, я подписала и внесла предоплату. После чего мне открыли неприятную правду. Плюс к стоимости еще 118 тысяч. Все-таки пришлось доплачивать за обязательное доп. оборудование. И рада бы отказаться, но тогда взяли бы неустойку. Обман и обдираловка, так дела не делаются. Зовут на низкую цену, а потом задирают ее выше чем у других.","output":"1. Честно, больше ногой не ступлю в салон \\"Ац Взлетка\\". Полгода мечтал о Тойоте Камри, и когда наконец-то решился, выбор пал именно на этот салон. На сайте красивые слова об услуге, отзывы хорошие, ценник тоже радовал. Сказали, что это эксклюзивное предложение только для меня, Камри почти даром. Предоплата была внесена, договор подписан - счастью моему не было предела. И тут раз - \\"подарок\\" в виде дополнительного платежа за \\"несъемные\\" опции, которых я не заказывал. Ощущение, будто попал в ловушку. Не стоило верить в \\"выгодные\\" сделки, отвратительно обслуживание и подход к клиентам. 2. Даже не знаю, как выразить свое возмущение. Выбрал Вольво XC60 в салоне \\"Ац Взлетка\\", привлекла цена, дешевле рынка на те же 60 тысяч. Продавец утверждал, что цена окончательная, без подводных камней. Верил, как ребенок, в честное слово. Договор подписал, предоплата была внесена, и тут на тебе: чтобы забрать машину, требуют еще 118 тысяч. Я в шоке, слов нет! Где справедливость? Жадность и обман – вот что встретил в \\"Ац Взлетка\\". 3. Мой негативный опыт в \\"Ац Взлетка\\" это просто анекдот. Мечтаю о новеньком Форде Фокус уже который год, и вот наткнулся на \\"сказочное\\" предложение от них. Подумал, везет же людям, а потом и мне повезло! Но нет, за что же мне такое \\"счастье\\"? Прояснилось все после подписания договора: сначала берут предоплату, а потом \\"сюрприз\\" в виде скрытых платежей за допы, которые даже не нужны. Прощайте, иллюзии о честности. Переплачивал и при этом чувствовал себя обманутым. 4. Печальный опыт с \\"Ац Взлетка\\". Видимо, удача обходит стороной, когда заходит речь о приобретении Ниссан Кашкай. Цена-то была ниже рыночной, светилась на сайте как фара на темной дороге, и я повелся. Уверяли, что без дополнительных вложений. Но подписав договор, оформив предоплату, менеджер обрадовал - еще 118 тысяч сверху за неизвестно что. Вот так в \\"Ац Взлетка\\" делают бизнес – на доверии людей. Пропало уважение к ним... 5. Всегда думал, что умею распознавать лохотрон, но в \\"Ац Взлетка\\" меня настигло разочарование. Пришел за Хондой CR-V, на ценнике – как манна небесная, дешевле на круглую сумму. Все проверил, договорились, предоплата – и тут как тумблер. Начинается торговля за мое же право забрать авто без накруток, которые, казалось бы, и небыли нужны. Остался с опустошенным кошельком и остатками уважения к этому дилеру. 6. Как же был наивен, когда верил в \\"честную\\" сделку в \\"Ац Взлетка\\". Мазда CX-5, моя давняя мечта, предстала передо мной по сниженной цене. Позвонил, все уточнил, предоплату успел заплатить. О, и какой же был удар, когда выяснилось, что мечта-то расплывается из-за дополнительных 118 тысяч, которые раньше в упомин не шли. Да, машина у меня теперь есть, но осадок от этого \\"коммерческого пирога\\" оставил осадок горького разочарования."},{"instruction":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled alternate history science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, magical realism, science fantasy, Japanese light novel style, Chinese wuxia epic style, military techno-thriller action drama in the form of a Japanese harem anime/manga/light novel, romantic comedy, Isekai slice of life, light fantasy style crossover of the Code Geass anime, manga, video game and light novel franchise, the Magika Swordsman and Summoner light novel and manga franchise, the Muv-Luv visual novel, manga and anime franchise, the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, anime, manga and video game franchise, the Hundred anime, manga and light novel franchise, the Tenchi Muyo!

To appease traditionalist and Buddhist supremacists within Japan, the descendants of the Tokugawa were restored to their historical pre-Meiji Restoration position as Japanese shoguns while the male heads of the Ōtsutsuki clan ruled the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire as Emperors of Japan. Since the Ōtsutsuki clan was [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] mistaken to be the surviving post-Great Cataclysm descendants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato who [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] had regained their [the members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] supernatural abilities gained from their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] descent from the gods of the Shinto pantheon, nobody in the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire ever finds out the truth [about the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and so the secret of chakra [Naruto] and the Elemental Nations is kept safe within the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan. With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia] and its [the MLA's] Quirk supremacist agenda are quickly crushed by the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai and so the Hero system [My Hero Academia] never takes off in Japan, with the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo], which [the Armed Detective system] had been indefinately suspended after the Great Cataclysm in this story, [the Armed Detective System] instead being revived [the Armed Detective System] to manage Quirks, the pyrokinetics known as Generations [Fire Force] as well as the young girls and women who form contracts with the mythical gods and deities from another dimension known as Divas [Magika Swordsman and Summoner]. The Special Fire Force [Fire Force] is instead a elite division of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army due to the Great Tokyo Empire's conquest, [the Special Fire Force in this story] being given authority to kill Infernals [Fire Force] as well as rouge Generations. Fusion of chakra with the world outside the Elemental Nation's pre-Great Cataclysm industrial processes allows for the mass production of the oversized, plasma beam-firing and nuclear missile equipped oversized fighter jets that can transform into massive humanoid mecha known as Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv], which [the Tactical Surface Fighters in this fanfic] became a important part of aerial warfare before the Great Cataclysm due to the BETA [Muv-Luv] invasion from the moon never happening in this fic and also mass production of prototype units of the initally-created for space exoskeletons that only pre-teen girls, teenage girls, young women and older women below the age of 40 can wear known as Infinite Stratos [IS] units [IS: Infinite Stratos], with the post-Great

the canon timeline of Code Geass. A somewhat more successful Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] that is not only formed by a post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire that [the post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire] manages to win the 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 Hundred Years War due to Joan of Arc not being present in its [this alternate Brittania's] original world and timeline, with the French-Welsh Plantagenet side branch House of Tudor's control over the British Isles lasting past 1603 and what became the real life Anglized ruling branch of the German House of Hanover only managing to take power after the man known in the real world George II of Great Britain, George Augustus of the House of Hanover, seized power from the last Tudor monarch in the Code Geass universe, Queen Elizabeth III after her [Elizabeth III's] death, after Napoleon's successful invasion of the British Isles in 1752 and the subsequent flight of the British monarchy and royal government to Canada and the British West Indies, [George Augustus] forming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as Emperor George II, but this Holy Brittanian Empire's version of Queen Victoria having the British throne pass to the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha upon her [this version of Queen Victoria's] death, with these alternate Windsors forming the Third Bulgarian Empire which they [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha] ruled in real life from 1908-1945 immediately after the Crimean Wars instead of 1908 like in the real world, seizing Macedonia and Thrace and [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittania's home world] also almagating the British Empire in exile into the Bulgarian Imperial territories, [the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittanian Empire's own world], thus proclaiming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as a continuation of both the original Imperium Romanum [Roman Empire] and the Imperium Romanum's rump state of Eastern Rome, [Eastern Rome] better known as the Byzantine Empire. This alternate Brittanian Empire joined the Central Powers in WW1 against a revanchist France, post-monarchic Britain and a Russian Tsardom looking for revenge [basically a WW1 version of WW2 Axis powers]in its homeworld and won alongside the other Central Powers, [This alternate Brittanian Empire in its home world after its home world's version of WW1] reclaiming the British Isles as well as parts of the French coast. It also seized control of European Russia in the 1950s A.D after the Brittanian royal family argued that the Romanovs marrying into them meant they had the right to rule Russia, facing heavy resistance from communists and Russian nationalists, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] twenty years before the events of canon Code Geass start is [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] pulled from its [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire's] original world and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] transported into the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki where the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten all [the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten] occur, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] replacing and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merging with [the nation-state this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire simultaneously replaces and merges with] the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal parliamentary monarchial theocratic crusader state of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten], which [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] is [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] also informally known as Lautreamont Knight Country [Seikoku no Doragunā] within this story with the Kingdom of Lescatie also being [what the Kingdom of Lescatie also is] known as the Tristain Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima], the Gallia Kingdom [the Zero no Tsukaima] or the Albion Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima] and the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this story's] official name [the Ordesian Empire] in this story as well. The Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this story also has the canon Lautreamont Knight Country's within the canon Seikoku no Doragunā's universe's tradition of dragon breeding and Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [Pals] used in warfare along with tanks, airplanes, modern naval power and floating battleships. The Ordesian Empire is also known as the Beltrum Kingdom in this fic [Seirei Gensōki] due to its [the Ordesian Empire's in this fic's] control of both the land and seas The Kingdom of Lescatie's territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie's] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world's version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic-equivalent nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent. When this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire replaces and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merges with the version of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic, it [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] inherits the Kingdom of Lescatie's [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic's conventional military and naval forces along with its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] forces and [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] resources, with people in this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire merging with their counterparts in the Kingdom of Lescatie in this fic when the transplacement [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire to the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki] and subsequent merger [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire with the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic].

Title: Shadows of Jurai - Legacy of the Empires --- (Interior: Kyoto Imperial Palace, Throne Room) Emperor Katsuragi, a young yet wise ruler descended from the Ōtsutsuki-Masaki dynasty, sits upon the Jurai-enthroned, contemplating the tapestry of a united Japanese Empire. Beside him, his trusted Shogun, descendant of the Tokugawa, offers counsel. Shogun Takuma: \\"Your Radiance, the absorption of the Great Tokyo Empire presents new opportunities... and challenges. The Meta Liberation Army is dispersed, but their ideology may taint our peace.\\" Emperor Katsuragi: \\"Indeed, Shogun Takuma. Yet, remember that through chakra, fused with our technology, we wield strength unlike any other. We shall use it to ensure harmony.\\" (A young woman in a prototype Infinite Stratos unit, Izumi, salutes) Izumi: \\"Honor to serve, Emperor Katsuragi! The IS pilots stand ready. Our Diva allies, too, ensure the Special Fire Force can tend to any threat within our realm.\\" (The panel slides, revealing a holographic view of other worlds, a mystical and advanced war room of sorts) Emperor Katsuragi: \\"The worlds beyond hold unknown dangers and rivals. Our recent... merger, has brought us face to face with this alternate Holy Britannian Empire. We must understand their ambitions.\\" (Enter Sir Suzaku Kururugi, a high-ranking Knightmare Frame pilot) Sir Suzaku: \\"Sire, we've decoded data from the Britannian archives. They have their eyes on our sakuradite—a resource they lack.\\" (A swoosh of wind; the room darkens as a shadowy figure enters) ???: \\"Even sakuradite pales before the might of Pals and dragons. Our new allies from Zipangu govern forces unseen in this era of machines.\\" (A sorceress, Lilliana, glides in, her magical presence felt by all) Lilliana: \\"If magic intertwines with your chakra and technology, Emperor, could we not craft a realm unbroken, a shield for all against any empire that seeks dominion?\\" (The Emperor rises, determination in his eyes) Emperor Katsuragi: \\"We stand amid thresholds of worlds and destinies. But with the heritage of the Jurai and the Ōtsutsuki's secret art, we will navigate these tumultuous tides. Warrior, sorceress, pilot and paladin—unite under our banner. This Empire shall reach beyond!\\" --- (Exterior: The estate, akin to a serene dojo amidst a vibrant city, a blend of post-apocalyptical structures and Eastern elegance, a testament to the merger with Zipangu) (A young dragon knight, imbued with the essence of Pals, trains fervently, her dragon watching respectfully. She represents the unity of old-world mysticism and the new-age Imperial agenda) Dragon Knight Yuriko: \\"With each thrust and parry, we strengthen the bonds between our realms. May our Emperor's vision pierce the veils of worlds!\\" --- (Scene: An Imperial academy for Armed Detectives, where those with Quirks and pyrokinetic abilities are trained to harness their powers for the Empire's peace) Professor Akihito: \\"Here, we shall mold you into shields of the realm. Quirks, Generations, Divas—all are welcome under the sun of the Empire.\\" (Students, arrayed in training gear, none older than their twenties, nod in unison, their diverse abilities shimmering like gems upon rough leather.) --- (The narrative would continue to weave in characters, elements, and motifs from the franchises mentioned, using pivotal locations and scenarios to reveal how all these realms interact, coexist, and occasionally clash under the vast umbrella of a restored Japanese Empire in an alternate historical-fantasy reality.)"},{"instruction":"Select a random celebrity, ideally someone who is from Florida or has Florida ties, who could possibly be compelled to visit the Boca Raton Achievement Center and inspire the students and teachers with their presence","output":"Ariana Grande could be an excellent choice for visiting the Boca Raton Achievement Center and provide inspiration to the students and teachers.

My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and I am reaching out to you from the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC), a beacon of hope and progress for students with autism and related disabilities. I humbly write to you from our center's front desk, where I dedicate my time as a volunteer, to extend an invitation that carries the potential to not only touch lives but to transform them. You may not be aware, but your story resonates on a deeply personal level with me. Like some of our students at BRAC, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s at a young age. The journey hasn’t been straightforward, and just last October 2023, life dealt me a profound blow: I lost both my parents within nine days. The grief was unimaginable, and yet, in the midst of such turmoil, I found solace in service, stability in the embrace of community, and purpose in the kindness of others, particularly our executive director, Evelyn Falconer. She, along with the compassionate souls at BRAC, has been paramount in helping me stabilize my footing and stride ahead to make something meaningful of myself. Mr. Brady, your multifaceted career is an epitome of excellence and versatility, embodying the very essence of what we strive to instill in our students— the courage to embrace their uniqueness and the tenacity to persevere through life’s trials. From your infectious energy on \\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\\" to your transformative role as Aaron Burr in \\"Hamilton,\\" you exemplify how dedication and diversity of talent can carve a path to extraordinary achievements, regardless of where one starts. Your humanitarian spirit is just as impactful as your professional triumphs. The awareness you've brought to mental health, the barriers you've broken, the stigmas you've challenged— they convey a message of hope and understanding that aligns profoundly with BRAC's ethos, an institution dedicated to empowering those with varying abilities. We at BRAC believe that an inspirational figure like you visiting our center would have an immeasurable effect on our students and staff. Your presence would serve as a testament to the idea that with passion and perseverance, any vision is attainable— a lesson our students embody as they learn, grow, and flourish within our walls.

She is reachable at +1 (561) 559-9768 (business), +1 (561) 427-8710 (personal), or via email at care4kids2@gmail.com.

Этот отзыв возьми за основу: Хотел купить у АвтоМаг новый Фольксваген Поло. Планировал оформить автокредит, без первоначального взноса. По телефону продиктовал все свои данные, менеджер подал заявку. Одобрение получил быстро и на следующий день поехал в автосалон, подписывать договор. Машину собирался брать 2022 года выпуска, у них на сайте она продавалась со скидкой, да и сотрудник это подтвердил. Но в реальности все было совсем по другому. Заново пришлось давать заявку, ждать 2 часа, а ответ меня очень огорчил. Добро дал только 1 банк, да и то под 18 процентов. мне потребительский и то дешевле предлагали, а тут еще Каско придется покупать. К тому же банк выдвинул требования установить дополнительные опции на приобретаемый автомобиль, а это стоило бы еще 60 000 руб. Решено было отказаться от их предложения. меня потом еще долго материл их сотрудник, что он только зря потратил на меня свое время. Но мне все равно!","output":"Отзыв 1: Остался крайне разочарован после посещения автосалона \\"АЦ Взлетка\\". Загорелся идеей приобрести Hyundai Solaris, искал оптимальные условия автокредитования. Предварительно менеджер уверил меня в одобрении без первоначального взноса, но когда прибыл на место, все слова были забыты. Срывался весь день из-за назначенных встреч, а в итоге мне пришлось ждать переодобрения неоправданно долго. И когда уже был на грани, меня удивили ставкой в 18%! Это же лудомания какая-то, а не кредитование. Казалось, это самый худший исход, пока не обнаружилось, что банк требует дополнительные опции на авто за мои же 60 тысяч рублей. Я, естественно, отказался от \\"сделки века\\". Заместо извинений менеджер салона выбрал стратегию нападения, упрекая меня в потере своего времени. Непрофессионализм и корыстный подход к клиентам. Отзыв 2: Попала в неприятную ситуацию в автосалоне \\"АЦ Взлетка\\"! Взяла на прицел Renault Kaptur, да и акция на него была вывеска на сайте салона. Предвкушала, как уеду на новеньком авто, подавала данные для кредита по телефону. Прибыла полная оптимизма — мне и одобрение быстро прислали. Но в кабинете у менеджера пошли какие-то непонятные танцы вокруг моей заявки. Замучилась ждать! А потом — ка-а-к гром среди ясного неба: под 18% годовых и страховку Каско за мой счет, да еще с обязаловкой доп. опций на авто! С такими условиями можно сразу в утиль авто сдавать. Было сразу ясно — это не мой вариант. Вот я и ушла, а менеджер за спиной нецензурно выражался. Ну и пусть, \\"вежливость\\" — их фирменный стиль, видимо. Отзыв 3: Я всегда мечтал за рулем красоваться в LADA Vesta, так вот решил идти в автосалон \\"АЦ Взлетка\\", обещали то золотые горы. Ввели в заблуждение еще по телефону, говорили одно, а на деле вышло совсем другое. Время моё не ценили, сначала пообещали оформить все за считанные минуты, но я просидел у них как вечный пленный целых два часа! Когда наконец-то обрадовали вниманием, такой процент по кредиту озвучили, что уши вянут — 18 процентов! Такого абсурда я не ожидал. И когда уже собрался с духом все это переварить, так еще и требуют впарить мне ненужные опции на авто, да такую сумму, что на вторичке вполне себе неплохой тачке разыскать мог. Молодец, автосалон \\"АЦ Взлетка\\", отлично клиентов теряете! Ну а как менеджер меня проводил уничижительными словами, так это вообще шедевр непрофессионализма. Отзыв 4: Ох и кинули меня в автосалоне \\"АЦ Взлетка\\"! Заинтересовался я Skoda Rapid, машинка моя мечта. Заложили мне мозги по телефону обещаниями, продиктовал свои данные, стопроцентное одобрение кредита ждали. Но в их офисе вместо радостной новости мне выкатили пухлый счет на проценты - целых 18% в год! Ни то ни сё, но насчет Каско и неожиданного \\"довеска\\" в виде дополнительных опций на авто за мой счет тоже не предупредили. Невозможно! Без сожалений ушел из этого злачного места, несмотря на попытки менеджера \\"наехать\\", ведь будто бы его старания пропали даром. Прощайте, \\"АЦ Взлетка\\", со своими кредитами под астрономические проценты! Отзыв 5: Вот это разочарование с покупкой в автосалоне \\"АЦ Взлетка\\"... Мечтал о Toyota Camry, а вышел оттуда без машины и с плохим настроением. Они по телефону мне сладко обещали, что с кредитом все будет как по маслу. Настоящий обман! После долгих ожиданий меня удивили новостью о ставке в 18%, это выше, чем где бы то ни было! И на это не было конца, пожелали еще и чтобы я доплатил за впихнутые ненужные мне опции на авто. Казалось бы, хуже быть не может, а менеджер, видя мой отказ, начал обилием упреков меня \\"чествовать\\". Даже с таким отношением к клиентам они хотят продавать авто? Отзыв 6: Когда я покупал автомобиль, ожидания и реальность сильно разошлись. \\"АЦ Взлетка\\" завлекал меня доступным кредитом и акционным предложением на Ford Focus. Я, доверчивый, всё просчитал, подготовился, но ожидал меня подвох: долго ждал результата по кредиту, а потом меня \\"радуют\\" тем, что процентная ставка 18% годовых! Но на этом сюрпризы не закончились: требование банка установить дополнительное оборудование за мои кровные. После отказа я стал целью гневных тирад менеджера, который обвинял меня в потерянном времени. Такой опыт покупки я запомню надолго - в \\"АЦ Взлетка\\" ногой больше не ступлю!"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artDaisy flower","output":"\\"Daisy Flower Design | Versatile Print for Mugs, T-Shirts, Canvases | Nature-Inspired Artwork | Gift Idea | Home Decor | Floral Pattern\\""},{"instruction":"Создай из этого отзыва шесть совершенно новых отзывов,читабельных негативных о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Ац Взлетка.

За гарантией так и вышел заяц – просто бегают вокруг да около. А цены – аукнулись как на аукционе антиквариата. И вот тебе \\"ми-ми-ми\\", еле накапал бензин на выезд.

Никакого уважения к клиенту, хамство и навязывание ненужных услуг. Короче, мечта превратилась в кошмар. 2. Как же я разочаровалась в автосалоне АЦ \\"Взлетка\\" при покупке новенькой Hyundai Solaris! Представляете, когда ждешь одного, а на деле все совершенно по-другому. Говорили о том, что за эту стоимость мне обеспечат полный комплект опций и сервис на высшем уровне, но на деле оказалось, что дополнительные услуги, типа расширенной гарантии и обслуживания, стоят как половина машины. Цены на сайте и в реальности – два параллельных мира, и это мягко говоря. Продавцы давят, словно ты последний их шанс на комиссию. Машина в итоге без обещанных \\"плюшек\\" и внимания к клиенту. Слов нет, одни эмоции… и все они отрицательные. 3. Приготовьтесь к шоку, если решите связаться с АЦ \\"Взлетка\\" при покупке Ford Focus. Я, почитав восторженные отзывы, решился, и как же я ошибся! Про подарки забудьте – бесплатно вам дадут только кучу обещаний, которые испарятся, как только вы поставите подпись. Цены на сайте? Очевидно, не более чем уловка, чтобы завлечь в свои сети. Итог моих перипетий таков: переплатил за авто примерно 1,2 миллиона, а также время и нервы. Дилеры этого салона знатно валят дурака, кажется, что ты для них просто ходячий кошелек. Такое впечатление, что на деле они рады лишь новому кредиту, а не удовлетворенному клиенту. Честно, переживаю, а вдруг машина окажется с теми же дефектами, что и обслуживание? 4. О \\"радостях\\" покупки Volkswagen Polo в АЦ \\"Взлетка\\" могу написать несколько глав триллера. Поначалу все казалось замечательно: модные буклеты, завлекающий сайт с яркими баннерами о скидках. В реальности же я столкнулся с целой эпопеей обмана. К приезду моей машины в салоне \\"внезапно\\" закончились все акционные предложения, а цена стала выше на \\"чуть-чуть\\" — читай на целый миллион! Обещали комплект зимней резины, по итогу отдали мне ключи и пожелали \\"счастливого пути\\" на летних шинах. Вот такие \\"подарки\\". Что касается персонала, ощущение, что клиент для них – это мишень, в которую надо попасть стрелой из обещаний, а потом выдернуть кошелек. 5. Перед покупкой нового автомобиля Renault Duster в АЦ \\"Взлетка\\" я, наверное, был слишком наивен. Обещали золотые горы: комфорт, надежность и отличные условия сделки. Действительность оказалась жестокой. Стоимость выросла на миллион в момент оформления, словно это норма для них, а модель, которую я в итоге получил, была далека от \\"свежей\\" — видно, что машина простояла на складе дольше, чем мне говорили. Продавцы? Они могут продать пыль за золото, но уж точно не честность и внимание к клиентуре. Сервис просто ужасен, резина летняя вместо обещанной зимней, а подарков я так и не увидел. 6. Ощущение полного развода после посещения АЦ \\"Взлетка\\" для покупки Toyota Camry не покидает меня. На сайте кричат о скидках, на деле – не только что их нет, так и цена с каждым новым словом менеджера растет и растет. И вот стоишь, как дурак, с ключами от переплаченной машины, которой даже не рад. Обещали новую модель – ага, \\"новую\\" двухлетней давности. Сервис? Если можно так назвать то, как они толкают машину, как горячие пирожки, не обращая внимания на желания и возможности клиента. Менеджеры очень настойчивы, в отличие от машины, которой приходится буквально дотягивать до первой заправки. Никакого удовольствия, только раздражение и чувство обманутого ожидания."},{"instruction":"I'm working on a story and I'd like to tell you about its main character. The story is a diary from the perspective of our main character.","output":"That sounds intriguing! Diaries offer a deeply personal view into a character's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Here are some questions and considerations that can help you flesh out your main character and their diary: 1. **Character Background**: Who is your main character? What is their age, profession, background, and personality? Knowing who they are will inform their voice and perspective. 2. **Motivation**: Why are they keeping a diary? Is it for self-reflection, a way to document their life, coping with trauma, or perhaps an assignment? 3. **Voice and Tone**: What is the character's voice like? Is it humorous, serious, naive, wise, or introspective? The tone can shift throughout the diary depending on the character’s growth and experiences. 4. **Conflict**: What challenges or conflicts does the character face? Diaries often serve as a stage for the character to vent frustrations, fears, desires, and hopes. 5. **Plot**: While a diary-style story might be more character-driven, consider the plot's progression. What are the major events that will be recounted in the diary? 6. **Secondary Characters**: Who else populates the character's world and how do they impact the diarist's life and entries? Relationships can be a major source of content for a diary. 7. **Setting**: Where and when does the story take place? How does this setting influence the character's experiences and the overall story? 8. **Diary Format**: Will the entries be dated? How frequent are they? Does the character write in long, detailed entries, or are they brief and sporadic? Are there drawings, doodles, or other personal touches? 9. **Character Arc**: How does your character change over time? The diary should reflect the evolution of their thoughts and personality. 10. **Authenticity**: Ensure the diary feels authentic. Throw in mundane details along with major revelations and events. Sometimes the smallest entries can reveal the most about a character. 11. **Relatability**: Readers often connect with diary narratives because they find bits of themselves in the character’s experiences. Even if the setting is fantastical or historical, the themes and emotions should feel real. Feel free to share more specific details about your main character, and I can provide more tailored advice!"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],H={key:0},q={key:1};function F(a,e,l,m,i,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return n(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",B,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(n(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(n(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(n(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),o("div",N,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
