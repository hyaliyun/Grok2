Since this SQL question involves a bit of complexity related to calculating time differences and handling duplicates, we can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) along with the LEAD() window function to find the time difference between consecutive non-duplicate actions for each user. Here's an example of how you might write the SQL query for this task: \`\`\`sql WITH RankedActions AS ( SELECT user_id, session_id, Action, timestamp, ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( PARTITION BY user_id, Action ORDER BY timestamp ASC ) AS ActionRank FROM Event ), DistinctUserActions AS ( SELECT user_id, session_id, Action, timestamp, LEAD(timestamp) OVER ( PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY timestamp ASC ) AS next_timestamp FROM RankedActions WHERE ActionRank = 1 ), TimeDifferences AS ( SELECT user_id, Action, TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, timestamp, next_timestamp) AS time_diff FROM DistinctUserActions WHERE next_timestamp IS NOT NULL ) SELECT AVG(time_diff) AS average_time_diff FROM TimeDifferences; \`\`\` This query does the following: 1. \`RankedActions\`: Orders user actions chronologically and ranks duplicate actions (same user and same action) using \`ROW_NUMBER()\`. This will help in filtering out duplicates by taking only the first occurrence of each action. 2. \`DistinctUserActions\`: Filters out the duplicate actions by choosing only those where \`ActionRank = 1\`. It also uses \`LEAD()\` to get the timestamp of the next distinct action in sequence. 3. \`TimeDifferences\`: Calculates the time difference in seconds between each pair of consecutive distinct actions using \`TIMESTAMPDIFF()\` for each user. 4. The final \`SELECT\`: Averages these time differences to get the average time taken between steps/actions. Please note that the function \`TIMESTAMPDIFF()\` is MySQL-specific for calculating the difference between two timestamps. If you are using a different SQL database system, the function for calculating the time difference might be different (e.g., \`DATEDIFF()\` in SQL Server, or simply subtracting the timestamps if the database supports direct arithmetic on time types). Furthermore, \`Event\` table does not seem to have a unique \`event_id\` or guaranteed ordering - the table's syntax you provided suggests it lacks primary or unique identifiers or properly sorted timestamps (timestamp's hour should be two digits format: \`2021-11-29 00:02:01\` instead of \`2021-11-29:00:02:01\`).

Here's the definition and some properties of \`tanh(x)\`: The hyperbolic tangent function, \`tanh(x)\`, is defined as: \`tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))\` Now, if you want to find \`tanh(x/2)\`, you just substitute \`x/2\` for \`x\` in the equation: \`tanh(x/2) = (e^(x/2) - e^(-x/2)) / (e^(x/2) + e^(-x/2))\` This is already a simplified expression of \`tanh(x/2)\` using the definition of the hyperbolic tangent function. However, you can also use the following identity that relates \`tanh(x/2)\` to \`tanh(x)\`: \`tanh(x/2) = (1 - cosh(x)) / sinh(x)\` Where \`cosh(x)\` and \`sinh(x)\` are the hyperbolic cosine and sine functions, respectively.

Conche ( Marcel ) , Le fondement de la morale , 1990","output":"Ce passage de Marcel Conche, extrait de son œuvre \\"Le fondement de la morale\\", aborde le thème du dialogue et du respect d'autrui sous l'angle de la reconnaissance de l'autre en tant qu'être capable de vérité et donc libre. Il met en contraste deux manières d'interagir avec autrui : 1. **Communication unidirectionnelle** : Là où l'autre est assimilé à un chien ou un esclave, il est réduit à n’être que le destinataire d'ordres, sans être invité à comprendre ou à questionner ces ordres. Dans un tel rapport, il n'est pas considéré comme un être capable de contribuer à une quelconque vérité, mais plutôt comme un sujet passif et sans voix. 2. **Dialogue équitable** : Conche évoque ensuite une interaction basée sur l'échange mutuel, où chaque participant est considéré comme un interlocuteur valable, capable de poser des questions, de fournir des réponses et de partager des vérités. Il met à l'avant le principe d'égalité dans la communication : chaque personne est vue comme pouvant apporter quelque chose de juste et de vrai, indépendamment de son statut social ou de son origine. Conche illustre ce deuxième concept en faisant référence à Platon qui, dans le dialogue \\"Ménon\\", utilise un esclave comme interlocuteur de Socrate pour démontrer que la capacité de dialoguer et de partager la vérité est indépendante du statut de l'individu. Cette scène philosophique souligne l'idée que tous les hommes, ayant la capacité de participer à un dialogue, sont égaux en droit, c'est-à-dire que chacun possède intrinsèquement le pouvoir de contribuer à la circulation de la vérité. Cette réflexion sur le dialogue et le respect d'autrui suggère que la reconnaissance de la capacité de l'autre à être source de vérité est fondamentale pour des interactions humaines basées sur le respect et la dignité. C'est un plaidoyer pour la communication respectueuse et ouverte qui prise la contribution de chaque individu à un discours collectif, au lieu de hiérarchiser les rapports humains de manière à réprimer l'expression et la liberté individuelle."},{"instruction":"Quel est l'idée générale de ce texte ?","output":"L'idée générale de ce texte de Marcel Conche est que le respect dans le dialogue et la reconnaissance de l'égalité fondamentale entre les individus sont essentiels pour une communication éthique et morale. Conche soutient que chaque personne, indépendamment de son statut, doit être considérée comme capable de contribuer à la vérité et de participer à un échange constructif. Il met en lumière l'importance de s'adresser aux autres en les écoutant et en les traitant comme des interlocuteurs valables, plutôt que comme des objets ou des outils pour exécuter des ordres sans possibilité de dialogue. Ce concept repose sur l'idée que tous les hommes ont en eux la capacité de rationalité et de compréhension, et donc, le droit de participer à un dialogue en tant qu'égaux."},{"instruction":"Explique cette expression dans le texte : un dialogue, une discussion ne peuvent avoir lieu qu'entre égaux","output":"L'expression \\"un dialogue, une discussion ne peuvent avoir lieu qu'entre égaux\\" signifie que pour qu'une véritable communication interactive et mutuellement respectueuse ait lieu, chaque participant doit être perçu et traité comme ayant une valeur égale et une capacité de contribution équivalente à la conversation. Cela implique la reconnaissance de chaque individu comme étant capable de comprendre, de poser des questions, de répondre et d'apporter des idées significatives et valides, indépendamment de leur statut social ou de leur pouvoir. Dans le contexte du texte, être \\"égaux\\" n’est pas nécessairement une question d'égalité socio-économique ou politique, mais plutôt d'égalité dans la capacité à échanger des idées, à intervenir dans la discussion, et à être considérés comme ayant la possibilité d'atteindre la vérité. C'est le fondement même d'un dialogue philosophique ou démocratique, où chaque personne est valorisée en tant qu'acteur rationnel et libre qui mérite écoute et considération. Marcel Conche souligne ce principe d'égalité de dialogue pour contrer des formes de communication où l'une des parties exerce un pouvoir autoritaire et la voix de l'autre partie est niée ou minimisée. Selon cette perspective, le respect d'autrui dans la conversation est un fondement nécessaire pour l'échange d'idées et l'amélioration commune de la compréhension."},{"instruction":"Donne moi l'intérêt philosophique de ce texte c'est à dire le problème posé par l'auteur et la solution donnée","output":"**Intérêt philosophique du texte :** **Problème posé :** Le texte soulève un problème philosophique fondamental sur la nature de la communication humaine et la reconnaissance mutuelle de l'égale dignité des individus. Le problème concerne la façon dont nous devons aborder et traiter les autres dans le cadre de nos interactions : soit comme des sujets méritant du respect, de l'écoute et dotés de la capacité de raisonner et de participer à la quête de vérité, soit comme de simples récepteurs d'ordres, sans droits à la parole ni à la compréhension. Le problème est aussi celui de la valeur intrinsèque de chaque individu qui, dans une communication inégale, peut être ignorée ou niée, conduisant ainsi à des relations de domination plutôt qu'à un dialogue authentique. Cela interroge les conditions sous lesquelles un véritable échange peut avoir lieu et les présupposés nécessaires au respect d'autrui dans un contexte dialogique. **Solution donnée :** La solution proposée par Marcel Conche consiste à adopter un cadre de dialogue où chaque personne est reconnue et traitée comme un égal en capacité intellectuelle et morale, quel que soit son statut dans la société. Selon Conche, la communication doit se fonder sur le principe que chaque individu est capable de vérité, donc libre, et mérite le respect qui accompagne ce statut. La reconnaissance mutuelle et le respect entre les interlocuteurs sont essentiels pour que le dialogue puisse s'épanouir dans un espace où la vérité peut circuler librement et où chaque voix a la possibilité d'être entendue et considérée. En s'appuyant sur l'idée platonicienne représentée dans le \\"Ménon\\", qui montre que même un esclave peut être un interlocuteur valide dans un dialogue philosophique, Conche affirme que la capacité de participer au dialogue n'est pas limitée à une certaine classe sociale ou intellectuelle, mais est une caractéristique universelle de l'humanité. Ainsi, la solution philosophique offerte se centre sur l'égalité fondamentale et la réciprocité dans la communication humaine comme conditions essentielles d'une société morale et juste."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee and Flower | Elegant Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Timeless Botanical Art | Versatile Home Decor &amp; Fashion Print.

The side length of the green triangle is 11. Find the side lengths of the red and blue triangles.","output":"It seems there might be a misunderstanding because I can't visualize the described equilateral triangle. To provide a detailed solution, I would need more information about the arrangement of the smaller triangles or a description of how the large triangle has been subdivided. However, I can provide you with a general approach for a common pattern in subdivided equilateral triangles. If an equilateral triangle is subdivided into smaller equilateral triangles, the pattern typically follows that each side is divided into segments of equal lengths. Then each of these segments becomes a side of a smaller equilateral triangle. Let's say the big triangle has been divided such that each of its sides has been split into 'n' smaller segments of equal length; this splits the triangle into n^2 smaller equilateral triangles. For a specific triangle within this pattern, the relationship between the side length of the large triangle (L), the number of segments per side of the large triangle (n), and the side length of the smaller triangle (l) is as follows: l = L / n Given that the side length of the green triangle is 11 and it's part of the larger pattern, the side lengths of the red and blue triangles would depend on how many times their sides are the side length of the green triangle. Let's say the red triangle has a side that is 'm' times the length of the green triangle, and the blue has 'p' times the length of the green. Then: - Side length of red triangle = m * 11 - Side length of blue triangle = p * 11 Without the visual or additional information on how the larger triangle is divided and where the red and blue triangles are in relation to the green triangle, we can't determine the exact values of 'm' and 'p' or the side lengths of the red and blue triangles. Please provide the arrangement or additional details so I can offer a precise solution."},{"instruction":"Cindy subtracted 9 from her favorite number and then divided the result by 3, giving an answer of 43.

We can set up the following equation: (x - 9) / 3 = 43 Now, let's solve for her favorite number: First, multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the division: 3 * ((x - 9) / 3) = 43 * 3 x - 9 = 129 Next, add 9 to both sides of the equation to solve for x: x - 9 + 9 = 129 + 9 x = 138 So, Cindy's favorite number is 138."},{"instruction":"Security Operating Procedure","output":"A Security Operating Procedure (SOP) is a document that outlines the protocols and measures an organization must follow to protect its resources, information, personnel, and assets from various threats.

Four years ago, Gabe was twice as old as Dani. In 10 years, Reid will be twice as old as Dani. How many years old is Reid now?","output":"Let's denote Reid's current age as ( R ), Gabe's current age as ( G ), and Dani's current age as ( D ). According to the problem, we have the following relationships: 1. ( R = 2G ) (Reid is twice as old as Gabe now.) 2. ( G - 4 = 2(D - 4) ) (Four years ago, Gabe was twice as old as Dani.) 3. ( R + 10 = 2(D + 10) ) (In 10 years, Reid will be twice as old as Dani.) Now, let's use these equations to solve for ( R ), ( G ), and ( D ). We can simplify equation 2: ( G - 4 = 2D - 8 ) ( G = 2D - 4 ) Substitute ( G ) from equation 1 into the new form of equation 2: ( R/2 = 2D - 4 ) Since ( R = 2G ), this can be rewritten as: ( 2G/2 = 2D - 4 ) ( G = 2D - 4 ) Now let's take the third equation and similarly simplify it: ( R + 10 = 2(D + 10) ) ( R + 10 = 2D + 20 ) ( R = 2D + 10 ) Now, we know ( R = 2G ), and from ( G = 2D - 4 ): ( R = 2(2D - 4) ) ( R = 4D - 8 ) Now we have two expressions for Reid's age, ( R ), in terms of Dani's age, ( D ): ( R = 2D + 10 ) ( R = 4D - 8 ) Let's set them equal to each other: ( 2D + 10 = 4D - 8 ) And solve for ( D ): ( 10 + 8 = 4D - 2D ) ( 18 = 2D ) ( D = 9 ) years old Now we know Dani is 9 years old. We can substitute back into the equation for Gabe's age: ( G = 2D - 4 ) ( G = 2(9) - 4 ) ( G = 18 - 4 ) ( G = 14 ) years old Finally, we solve for Reid's age using ( R = 2G ): ( R = 2(14) ) ( R = 28 ) years old So, Reid is currently 28 years old."},{"instruction":"Mikroorganisme yang terdapat pada air kolam merupakan komponen...dari lingkunganA.tambahanB.biotikC.utamaD.pendukungE.abiotik","output":"Mikroorganisme yang terdapat pada air kolam merupakan komponen biotik dari lingkungan.

Проблема в том, что при остановке gif и перезапуске (то есть смена background), gif продолжает работать на фоне и из-за этого повторный запуск начинается не с самого начала gif, а с какого-то другого момента.","output":"Как правило, когда WEB-разработчики хотят сделать возможность воспроизведения и остановки GIF-изображения, они используют два разных изображения: статическое изображение (PNG, JPEG и т. д.) и собственно GIF. Таким образом, когда пользователь нажимает на кнопку, статическое изображение заменяется GIF-изображением, которое начинает проигрываться со старта, и наоборот. Однако важно заметить, что браузеры кэшируют изображения, и это влияет на поведение GIF-файлов. Переключение исходного изображения на GIF и обратно не всегда приводит к перезагрузке GIF-файла, особенно если он был закэширован. Из-за этого могут возникать ошибки, подобные той, что вы описали. В вашем коде, при остановке GIF, вы просто меняете фон на PNG-версию, но при переключении обратно браузер может продолжать воспроизведение GIF с того момента, на котором он завершил воспроизведение, а не сначала. Это особенность поведения GIF в браузере; для того чтобы воспроизвести более надежно, необходимо принудительно перегрузить изображение. Один из способов это сделать — изменить URL GIF-изображения, добавив к нему параметр времени. Вот пример функции, которая это делает: \`\`\`javascript function toggleGifPlayback() { isGifPlaying = !isGifPlaying; if (isGifPlaying) { // Добавляем параметр времени к URL, чтобы избежать кэширования const gifUrl = '/assets/images/my-avatar.gif?' + new Date().getTime(); gifBox.style.cssText = \\"background: url('\\" + gifUrl + \\"') no-repeat center center;\\" + gifBoxStyle; playPauseIcon.setAttribute('name', 'pause-circle-outline'); playPauseBox.style.opacity = '0'; } else { gifBox.style.cssText = \\"background: url('/assets/images/my-avatar-gif.png') no-repeat center center;\\" + gifBoxStyle; playPauseIcon.setAttribute('name', 'play-circle-outline'); playPauseBox.style.opacity = '1'; } } \`\`\` Добавление \`new Date().getTime()\` к URL GIF-изображения генерирует уникальный адрес каждый раз, заставляя браузер загружать изображение заново, а не использовать закэшированную версию. Это должно помочь проигрывать GIF с начала каждый раз, когда он запускается."},{"instruction":"молодец!","output":"Спасибо!

Инлайновые стили переопределяют селекторы из внешних стилевых файлов, если только они не помечены как \`!important\`. Если вы хотите, чтобы стили \`:hover\` срабатывали как задумано, вам нужно либо не устанавливать \`opacity\` напрямую через JavaScript, либо сбрасывать его, когда вы хотите, чтобы CSS снова взял контроль. Чтобы решить эту проблему, вам нужно установить \`opacity\` непосредственно внутри \`toggleGifPlayback\` так, чтобы при наведении CSS снова стал приоритетным. Сделать это можно, устанавливая \`opacity\` в null или пустую строку, что удалит инлайновый стиль и позволит работать вашим CSS-правилам: \`\`\`javascript function toggleGifPlayback() { isGifPlaying = !isGifPlaying; if (isGifPlaying) { gifBox.style.backgroundImage = \\"url('/assets/images/my-avatar.gif?\\" + new Date().getTime() + \\"')\\"; playPauseIcon.setAttribute('name', 'pause-circle-outline'); playPauseBox.style.opacity = '0'; } else { gifBox.style.backgroundImage = \\"url('/assets/images/my-avatar-gif.png')\\"; playPauseIcon.setAttribute('name', 'play-circle-outline'); // Сбрасываем значение opacity, чтобы CSS селектор :hover снова работал playPauseBox.style.opacity = ''; } } \`\`\` Теперь, после того как вы нажмёте на кнопку, чтобы остановить воспроизведение GIF, инлайновый стиль \`opacity\` будет сброшен, и ваш CSS с \`:hover\` сможет снова его контролировать."},{"instruction":"Как раздать интернет компьютера телефону через usb","output":"Чтобы раздать интернет с компьютера на телефон через USB, вам потребуется использовать функцию, иногда называемую \\"USB tethering\\". Этот процесс может немного различаться в зависимости от операционной системы вашего компьютера и версии Android или iOS на вашем телефоне. Ниже приведены общие шаги для Android и Windows: # Для Android: 1. **Подключите ваш Android-телефон к компьютеру с помощью USB-кабеля.** 2. **Разблокируйте телефон** и перейдите в \`Настройки\`. 3. Найдите раздел **сетевых подключений**. Это может быть \`Подключения\` -> \`Мобильная сеть\` -> \`Точка доступа и модем\`, или что-то похожее, в зависимости от версии Android и оболочки от производителя. 4. Активируйте опцию **USB-модем** (USB tethering). После этого ваш телефон установит сетевое соединение с компьютером, и интернет компьютера начнёт распределяться на телефон. # Для iPhone (iOS): 1. **Подключите ваш iPhone к компьютеру с помощью кабеля Lightning (или 30-pin, если у вас старая модель).** 2. Откройте \`Настройки\` -> \`Сотовая связь\`. 3. **Нажмите на \\"Модемный режим\\" (Personal Hotspot)** и включите его скользящим переключателем. 4. Если вы включили модемный режим впервые, компьютер может потребовать установки драйверов (или iTunes, если у вас Windows). 5. После того как драйвера будут установлены, интернет с вашего компьютера должен начать распределяться на ваш iPhone через кабель. Будьте внимательны, так как при использовании USB tethering может быть использован ваш мобильный трафик, если у вашего компьютера нет своего интернета, и это может быть платно в зависимости от вашего тарифного плана. Также вам стоит проверить, не заблокирован ли USB tethering вашим мобильным оператором или политикой безопасности устройства. Обратите внимание, что процесс может отличаться в зависимости от вашей конкретной конфигурации и версий ОС. Если указанные выше инструкции не помогли, рекомендуется обратиться к документации вашего устройства или поиску в интернете инструкций, соответствующих вашей операционной системе и модели телефона."},{"instruction":"Какие правила в брандмауере windows 10 должны быть включены в исходящем трафике для корректной работы мобильного хот-спота?","output":"Когда вы используете мобильный хот-спот на своём компьютере под управлением Windows 10, большая часть необходимых настроек брандмауэра обычно устанавливается автоматически. Однако, если вы столкнулись с проблемами, вам может потребоваться проверить следующие правила брандмауэра: 1. **Правила для общего доступа к Интернету:** Эти правила обычно необходимы для работы мобильного хот-спота и должны быть включены автоматически, когда вы настраиваете хот-спот. Они могут включать правила для различных служб и протоколов, таких как DHCP (Динамическая конфигурация хост-протокола) и DNS (Система доменных имён). 2. **Правила для приложений:** Приложениям, которыми вы хотите пользоваться через хот-спот, могут потребоваться определенные исходящие правила. Например, если вы хотите пользоваться браузерами, такими как Chrome или Firefox, убедитесь, что для них включены соответствующие правила в брандмауэре. 3. **Правила для Windows Update:** Если вы хотите обновить Windows через хот-спот, вам нужно убедиться, что исходящие правила для Windows Update включены. Чтобы просмотреть и настроить правила брандмауэра в Windows 10, выполните следующие шаги: 1. Откройте Панель управления (можно использовать поиск в Windows и ввести \\"Панель управления\\"). 2. Перейдите в \\"Система и безопасность\\" > \\"Брандмауэр Windows Defender\\". 3. В левом меню выберите \\"Дополнительные параметры\\". 4. В открывшемся окне \\"Дополнительные настройки брандмауэра Windows Defender\\" выберите \\"Правила для исходящего трафика\\". 5. Проверьте правила, связанные с сетевыми службами и приложениями, которыми вы планируете пользоваться через мобильный хот-спот. Если правило отключено, вы можете дважды щёлкнуть по нему и изменить его свойства, чтобы разрешить исходящий трафик для соответствующих служб или приложений. Примите во внимание, что ослабление настроек брандмауэра может увеличить уязвимость вашей системы, поэтому изменяйте настройки брандмауэра осознанно и только если вы понимаете, для чего это делаете. Если вы не уверены, какие правила необходимо изменить, лучше всего обратиться за помощью к специалисту по IT-безопасности."},{"instruction":"Как называется служба хот-спота в диспетчере задач?

Однако, это не значит, что служба не используется системой Windows для управления построения мобильной точки доступа. Правила брандмауэра для мобильного хот-спота в Windows основываются на функциональных возможностях \\"поделиться\\" интернет-подключением, и это обычно встроено в сетевые сервисы операционной системы, а не в сторонние сервисы, которые можно увидеть в Диспетчере задач. Если вы хотите добавить правило в брандмауэр Windows для разрешения интернет-трафика через мобильный хот-спот, вы можете сделать это через \\"Дополнительные настройки\\" брандмауэра, как было описано ранее. Однако, добавление или изменение таких правил на уровне служб обычно не требуется, так как система автоматически настраивает необходимые разрешения при активации функции мобильного хот-спота. Если вы все же хотите попытаться добавить такое правило, вы должны сделать это через групповую политику или консоль управления брандмауэра (например, через \`wf.msc\`), разрешив трафик для служб, связанных с сетевыми функциями Windows (например, для DHCP, DNS), а также для всех сетевых профилей, используемых вашим хот-спотом (частная, публичная, доменная).

While the essence of the sentence wouldn't change significantly over the decades in question, the context in which it's used might shift according to the cultural, economic, and social changes of each era. Slang and idiomatic expressions could be used to make the sentence sound more era-appropriate, but complete accuracy in terms of colloquialisms and speech patterns would require extensive linguistic research specific to each time period and cultural context.

Response time (응답 시간): 응답 시간은 사용자가 요청을 시작한 순간부터 시스템이 그 요청에 대해 완전히 응답할 때까지의 시간을 의미합니다. 다시 말해, 시스템이 특정 작업을 수행하고 결과를 제공하는 데 걸리는 시간을 말합니다. 이는 엔드유저의 경험와 직결되는 중요한 지표인데, 응답 시간이 길어질수록 사용자의 불만족도가 증가할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 웹 페이지가 로드되기까지 걸리는 시간이나, 데이터베이스 쿼리에 대한 응답 시간을 생각해 볼 수 있습니다. 2. Throughput (처리량): 처리량은 단위 시간당 시스템이 완료할 수 있는 작업의 양을 나타냅니다. 이는 특정 기간 동안 시스템이 얼마나 많은 데이터를 처리하거나 얼마나 많은 트랜잭션을 실행할 수 있는지를 의미합니다. 처리량은 시스템의 전반적인 성능을 나타내는 지표로, 고성능이 요구되는 환경에서 매우 중요합니다. 예를 들어, 네트워크의 경우 초당 전송하는 데이터의 양인 비트레이트(bitrate)로 측정할 수 있고, 웹서버의 경우 초당 처리할 수 있는 요청의 수로 표현할 수 있습니다. 두 지표는 종종 서로 상충할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 시스템이 처리량을 최대화하기 위해 많은 요청을 한꺼번에 처리하려 할 때 개별 요청의 응답 시간이 길어질 수 있습니다. 실제 시스템 설계와 운영에서는 이 두 지표 사이에서 적절한 균형을 찾아야 하며, 시스템의 목표와 요구 사항에 따라 어떤 지표를 더 중시할지 결정해야 합니다."},{"instruction":"please correct the grammar: Based on our contract payment terms, time for payment will be 20% downpayment, and progress billing for 50% contract price on prior to undocking, and 30% contract price after sea trial.

Under her leadership, the UK was one of the Western nations that exhibited strong moral and political support for Solidarity, the first independent trade union in the communist bloc, which represented a burgeoning resistance to Soviet influence and authoritarian control in Poland. Here are a few ways through which Thatcher's influence and actions may have contributed to the success of the Solidarity movement: 1. Political Support: Thatcher was known for her staunch anti-communist stance and was one of the key Western leaders supporting democratic reforms in Eastern Europe. She repeatedly expressed solidarity with the aims of the Polish trade union and dissident movement and used diplomatic channels to advocate for human rights and political freedoms in Poland. 2. Economic Pressure: The UK, along with other Western nations, applied economic pressure on the Soviet bloc by making clear that improved trade relations were contingent upon respect for human rights and democratic freedoms in Eastern Europe. Such pressures, while not solely attributable to Thatcher, were part of a broader international strategy to encourage political liberalization. 3. Providing a Platform for Dissidents: Thatcher's government allowed dissidents and representatives of the Solidarity movement to visit the UK and use it as a platform to raise awareness for their cause, increasing international attention and support. 4. Encouraging Perestroika and Glasnost: Thatcher developed a working relationship with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and supported his policies of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness), which eventually led to a loosening of the Soviet grip on Eastern Europe. Her endorsement of Gorbachev helped create an environment where movements like Solidarity could gain strength. 5. Moral Encouragement: Thatcher's reputation for being a resolute and principled leader, standing firm against Soviet communism, provided moral encouragement to anti-communist movements across the Eastern bloc. Her meetings with key figures like Lech Wałęsa, the leader of Solidarity, helped lend international credibility to the movement. While Thatcher's role was mainly indirect, it is part of a larger web of international influences and pressures that contributed to the success of Solidarity, which played a crucial role in undermining communist authority in Poland and eventually precipitated the fall of the Iron Curtain and the democratization of Eastern Europe. It is important to note, however, that the primary driving force behind Solidarity's success was the Polish people's staunch determination to achieve greater political freedoms and workers' rights."},{"instruction":"what did margaret thatcher exactly do that helped the solidarity movement","output":"Margaret Thatcher's contribution to the success of the Solidarity movement in Poland, while not direct, can be understood through a range of supportive actions on the international political stage: 1. **Diplomatic Backing and Visibility**: Thatcher offered diplomatic support to the Solidarity movement, meeting with its leader Lech Wałęsa and providing him with a platform to voice his struggles for Polish independence and reform on the international stage. Giving political dissidents such as Wałęsa visibility and credibility was crucial in building global pressure against the communist government of Poland. 2. **Financial Aid and Assistance**: Under Thatcher, the UK contributed to a broader Western effort to provide financial support both to the Polish state under conditions of reform and directly to the Solidarity movement and associated dissident activities. This took various forms, including covert assistance facilitated by Western intelligence services, designed to help Solidarity sustain itself through the repressive periods of martial law and state crackdowns that began in 1981. 3. **International Pressure and Sanctions**: Thatcher's government was among those in the West that imposed sanctions on Poland's communist regime following the imposition of martial law. While Thatcher believed in engagement, the UK joined other countries in using economic measures to pressure the Polish government to negotiate with the Solidarity movement and move towards liberal reform. 4. **Political Support for Reforms**: Thatcher was one of the influential voices in the West urging the communist government in Poland to pursue dialogue and political reform, acknowledging that the Solidarity movement represented the will of a large section of the Polish population. This support often translated into conditional promises for economic aid and political incentives if Poland moved toward a more open and democratic society. 5. **Moral Support**: It is also worth noting that simply by advocating for principles of democracy, self-determination, and free market economics, Thatcher and her contemporaries provided moral support to dissident movements in the Eastern Bloc, including Solidarity. Her unyielding stand against communism was a source of encouragement to those fighting for freedom and reform behind the Iron Curtain. Ultimately, Thatcher's contributions to the success of the Solidarity movement in Poland were in the context of an international effort to support the lifting of the Iron Curtain and the spread of democracy in Eastern Europe. Her actions complemented those of other Western leaders, such as U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II, and contributed to a global environment increasingly favorable to the aims of Solidarity and other dissident movements."},{"instruction":"What did ronald reagan specifically do that helped the solidarity movement","output":"Ronald Reagan, as the President of the United States from 1981 to 1989, played a considerable role in supporting the Solidarity movement in Poland through various political and economic strategies. His administration's efforts were rooted in a broader Cold War context aiming to weaken Soviet influence and bolster democratic movements in Eastern Europe. Here are specific actions taken by Reagan and his administration that aided Solidarity: # Public Condemnation of the Communist Regime Reagan was vocal in criticizing the imposition of martial law in Poland in December 1981, which the communist government used to suppress the Solidarity movement. Through speeches and public addresses, Reagan brought international attention to the situation in Poland and legitimized the Solidarity cause. # Economic Sanctions Reagan imposed economic sanctions on the Polish government and the Soviet Union to pressure them to lift martial law and restore human rights in Poland. These sanctions included suspending most-favored-nation trade status, prohibiting high-technology exports to the Soviet Union (intended to hinder their pipeline projects in Europe), and blocking Polish requests for credit from international monetary institutions. # Covert Aid With Reagan's authorization, the CIA undertook a significant covert operation to support Solidarity. This aid included communicating equipment such as printing machines, fax machines, and radios that Solidarity used to disseminate information and coordinating with other intelligence services to ensure that the aid reached its intended recipients without being intercepted by Polish authorities or the KGB. # Labor Support The Reagan administration, along with American labor unions such as the AFL-CIO, provided material assistance and encouragement to Solidarity. They established funds and campaigns aimed at raising awareness for the Polish workers' plight and providing critical support for the continuation of their activities despite the crackdown. # Human Rights Advocacy The Reagan White House continually placed human rights at the forefront of its policy priorities in dealing with Eastern European countries. By framing support for Solidarity within a broader human rights context, it helped keep the struggle of the Polish people on the global agenda. # Rallying International Support Reagan urged Western allies to sustain a united front in backing Solidarity and applying pressure on the Polish regime. This international alliance was crucial in establishing a consensus against the Soviet-backed suppression of the movement. # Moral Support and Solidarity Reagan demonstrated moral support for the Solidarity movement, symbolically aligning the movement’s pursuit of freedom with American values. By expressing solidarity with the Polish people, Reagan helped to galvanize a sense of global unity behind the cause of freedom and reform in Eastern Europe. Reagan's actions must be understood as complementary to a confluence of factors, including the role played by Pope John Paul II (himself a Pole), the internal decline of the Soviet Union, and the persistent bravery of the Polish people. Ultimately, the multifaceted support from the Reagan administration played a significant part in the eventual reemergence of Solidarity as a legal political force in 1989, leading to the first semi-free elections in Poland and setting the stage for the end of communist rule in Eastern Europe."},{"instruction":"Após ler o texto, que é uma repor- tagem, um funcionário do jornal decidiu enviá-lo por e-mail a um colega, mas, além do texto completo, ele resolveu tam- bém anexar uma imagem com a capa do jornal.

Dentro das opções fornecidas, a única que exige o uso do acento indicativo de crase, seguindo a norma padrão da língua portuguesa, é: d) a suas duas assessoras de imprensa Neste caso, a crase é necessária porque há a fusão entre a preposição \\"a\\" (que indica a quem a declaração foi dada) e o artigo definido feminino plural \\"as\\" (que acompanha o substantivo \\"assessoras\\").

No caso da frase original, \\"'É importante informá-lo dos seus direitos'\\", temos o pronome oblíquo \\"lo\\" sendo utilizado como complemento direto, e a preposição \\"dos\\" está corretamente empregada indicando a matéria da informação (os direitos). Se substituirmos o pronome \\"lo\\" pelo \\"lhe\\", que é um pronome oblíquo de terceira pessoa do singular que funciona como complemento indireto, devemos garantir que a preposição apropriada seja mantida para preservar o mesmo sentido na frase.

Uma das regras mais básicas é que, numa enumeração, a vírgula é usada para separar elementos da mesma função gramatical ou partes de uma frase, exceto antes da conjunção \\"e\\" que geralmente liga o último elemento da enumeração. Entretanto, há exceções quando há conjunções repetidas ou numeração de sujeitos diferentes, podendo-se usar vírgula para clareza ou ênfase. Considerando a frase \\"tendo como base a ética, a qualidade dos produtos e a boa prestação de serviços ao consumidor\\", o uso típico da vírgula seguiria a regra de enumeração sem a inclusão da vírgula antes da conjunção \\"e\\". A alternativa que melhor reflete essa decisão, considerando as regras de emprego da vírgula de acordo com a norma-padrão e assumindo que não há nenhuma razão especial para uma vírgula antes de \\"e\\", como a separação de sujeitos diferentes ou elementos em oposição, seria: c) interpretação de que a ênfase criada pela vírgula antes do e era desnecessária.

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how the resale value or what is considered the residual value after depreciation hold up well for gas powered mopeds but doesn't for electric mopeds even from established brands like BMW and Segway. Whereas the prospective buyer of a moped can be expected to have a useable transport vehicle even after twenty years of ownership if he keeps it in good condition, the fickle and fleeting nature of electric mopeds, due to the technological advancement of battery technology renders the residual value of early pioneers who own these vehicles with the prospect of a much diminished value after a comparable period of time compared with their gas motor counterparts.","output":"The residual value of gas-powered mopeds remains robust over time while that of electric mopeds tends to wane significantly, an economic reality that serves as a beacon for those inclined toward financially sustainable vehicle ownership. Established brands like BMW and Segway, despite their pedigree and market recognition, are not immunized against this depreciation dilemma in their electric moped offerings. To understand the depreciation of gas versus electric mopeds, we must first dissect the underlying values that prop up the resale capabilities of gas-powered versions. Traditional mopeds, with combustion engines, boast a simplicity of design and endurance born from a century of engineering evolution. The engines, typically made with robust metal components and designed for ease of repair, are workhorses known to withstand the test of time. Their enduring performance is a testament to their resilience, asserting that, with proper upkeep, a twenty-year-old moped can still whir and buzz through city streets as a reliable mode of transport. It's not uncommon to find these mopeds, having spanned multiple decades and miles, still fetching a decent price on the secondary market, their duration as a functioning vehicle not yet exhausted. Conversely, electric mopeds represent the vanguard of vehicular technology, driven by an ambition to craft more sustainable and eco-friendly transport options. The linchpin of these electric variants is the battery, an ever-evolving technology that promises greater efficiency and power with each generation. However, therein lies the paradoxical shortcoming that undermines the residual value of electric mopeds. The rapid advancement of battery technology, while a boon for innovation and environmental stewardship, renders early models quickly obsolete. The battery cells, susceptible to degradation over time and charge cycles, precipitate a truncated lifespan when compared to their gasoline-fueled contemporaries. Another pivotal factor that drives down the resale value of electric mopeds is the cost associated with replacing batteries. Once an electric moped's battery begins to falter, the vehicle's range and power decrease, invariably requiring a costly replacement to restore its original functionality. Such an investment in a used electric moped can dissuade potential buyers, especially when newer models with advanced battery technology and enhanced features are available. Moreover, the resale market for electric mopeds is further handicapped by consumer perception. Skepticism pervades among used vehicle shoppers, who are wary of the potential hidden costs and unknown longevity of electric moped batteries. This apprehension is virtually absent in the gas moped market, where a well-maintained engine inspires confidence in further serviceability and value retention. In the theatre of transportation, gas mopeds command an enduring stage presence, while their electric cousins, despite their revolutionary pedigree, assume the role of fleeting spectacles. Market dynamics indicate that electric moped owners, those early pioneers on the road to a more electrified future, face the inevitability of a depreciated asset. As battery technology surges forward in leaps and bounds, early electric mopeds find themselves relegated to the shadows of obsolescence, their value diminishing in the glow of newer, more capable machines. In conclusion, the economic lifespan of a moped is not merely a function of its physical machinery but an integration of market perception and technological progression. Gas-powered mopeds, relics of steadfast engineering and simplicity, continue to wearable the laurels of sustained residual value. On the other hand, electric mopeds suffer the plight of their innovative cores, where the agility of technological advancement comes at the cost of residual worth, leaving their owners gazing upon a horizon where value fades into the quicksilver rush of progress. The disparity in depreciation patterns between these two vehicular paths illuminates the dichotomy of durable tradition and the transient nature of pioneering electric mobility."},{"instruction":"explain and document the interior dimensions of the maximum cargo area of the hyundai santa fe suv in terms of the area behind the front seats with the back seats removed or laying flat down. use the measurements of height, width and length in inches. use the latest model year of the suv.","output":"As an expert, I acknowledge your request for detailed information regarding the interior cargo dimensions of the latest Hyundai Santa Fe SUV model. To provide the most accurate and updated details, it is essential to base the analysis on the latest available model at the time of the knowledge cut-off, which is the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe. Hyundai's official documentation for this model provides specific measurements for cargo space, particularly when the rear seats are laid flat, creating an expansive area for transportation of larger items or increased luggage capacity. The 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe offers substantial cargo room behind the front seats when the rear seats are folded down. According to Hyundai, the cargo area dimensions are as follows: - **Length:** When the back seats are folded flat, the maximum cargo length from the back of the front seats to the rear liftgate is approximately 74.8 inches. This is a significant distance, ensuring room for a variety of large items. - **Width:** The maximum interior width of the cargo area is around 59.1 inches. However, this is the total width of the cargo space and does not account for the wheel wells, which can intrude into the space, reducing the usable width in some sections. - **Height:** The height from the cargo floor to the roof of the cargo area measures nearly 31.9 inches. This vertical space allows for the transportation of tall items and facilitates easy stacking of cargo. When calculating the overall cargo volume with the rear seats folded, the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe boasts up to 72.1 cubic feet of space. However, this volume measurement does not break down into specific length, width, and height but is a general indicator of the total cargo capacity. To provide a more vivid representation of the cargo space available, consider that the vertical and horizontal dimensions can comfortably accommodate larger household items, such as flat-screen TVs, bicycles, or a generous amount of camping equipment. The cargo area is not only expansive but also intelligently designed to maximize usability, featuring a flat floor that facilitates the loading and unloading of heavy objects. While the figures shared are based on manufacturer specifications, it is crucial for potential buyers to visually inspect and, if possible, use a tape measure to confirm these dimensions of the actual vehicle, as there may be slight variances in production or changes that occur post-manufacturer specification announcements. In conclusion, the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe's cargo area, when formatted for maximum storage with the rear seats down, offers a substantial volume and generous interior dimensions. This flexibility and capacity make the vehicle highly versatile, serving well for those requiring significant cargo space for transportation or leisure activities."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story about comedian Matt Rife doing a stand-up special about him talking about the time he went to bathe in a pond in the buff, and while relaxing he farted, and some fish went belly-up dead from how bad it smelt","output":"Title: \\"Matt Rife's Pond Plunge: A Stinky Stand-Up Special\\" Once upon a moonlit evening, at a comedy club filled to the brim with eager laughter-seekers, Matt Rife swaggered on stage with a mischievous glint in his eye. He was about to regale the audience with a tale so outlandish, so pungently powerful, that it would go down in comedy history. The crowd hummed with anticipation, their chuckles warming up the room like a pre-heated giggle oven. \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, what I'm about to share with you is a true story of nature, nudity, and a nose-assault so potent, it could be classified as a weapon of mass destruction. This is the epic saga of 'The Day I Gassed the Fish.'\\" An excited hush swept over the crowd as Matt plunged into his story... \\"So there I was, one with nature, stripping down to my birthday suit ready to take a dip in the most serene pond you could picture, like something out of a fancy screensaver,\\" Matt began. \\"Imagine the scene, folks: the sun setting, birds chirping, and me, about to bond with Mother Earth in the most primal way possible.\\" With theatrical gestures, he continued, \\"Ah, the water was like silk, like, if silk was wet. And chilly. And made you worry about what's brushing against your leg. But there I was, floating, meditating, contemplating the universe and my place within it.\\" He then leaned in, lowering his voice for dramatic effect. \\"And that's when it happened. The bubbles of doom rose from the depths of my being. It was sudden, it was quiet, but the repercussions, my friends, were apocalyptic.\\" The crowd erupted in a symphony of laughter as Matt mimicked the infamous underwater fart, cheeks puffing out and all. He then paused, panned his gaze across the room and deadpanned, \\"The stench. Oh, the stench...it was like nothing you could imagine. It was as if every bad decision I've ever made had fermented and decided to make a surprise cameo.\\" He proceeded to paint an intoxicating picture, \\"The fish didn't stand a chance. They were going about their business, engaging in fishy activities, and BAM! Instant belly-up! The aqua-life was not ready for this secret weapon my derriere had deployed.\\" Matt strutted about the stage, acting out the scene, \\"Here I am in the pond, suddenly the Grim Reaper of the deep, wondering if I should go into hiding or call the EPA to report myself for an environmental disaster.\\" Imitating a fish with his hands clasped together and flipping in the air, he continued, \\"And there they were, floating to the surface like tiny scaly casualties of my intestinal wrath. If PETA got wind of this, I'd be the first comedian with an aquatic hit list.\\" The room was echoing with hilarity, people holding their sides as tears streamed down their faces in jovial agony. Matt's comedic timing was impeccable as he recounted his sprint from the pond, naked as the day he was born, chased by the ghostly stink of his own creation. \\"And you know,\\" Matt added with a smirk, \\"I learned a valuable lesson that day. Always swim downwind. And maybe stick to showers.\\" With a mock-serious nod, he concluded, \\"I stand before you, not just as a humble comedian but as a man who took on Mother Nature and left a mark so profound that, to this day, fish whisper my name with a shudder...or they would if fish could talk and had working noses.\\" The audience was in stitches, gasping for air in between howls of laughter. Matt Rife, the man, the myth, the accidental fish assassin, took a bow as the crowd gave him a thunderous standing ovation. This stinky stand-up special would not soon be forgotten, etched into comic lore as the night Matt Rife turned a tranquil pond into the world's worst jacuzzi."},{"instruction":"Напиши код на питоне по псевдокоду: Алгоритм на псевдокоде Адаптивный код Хаффмана Обозначим w – окно mas – массив вероятностей символов и кодовых слов DO (i=1,…n) w[i]:=a[i] OD (заполняем окно символами алфавита) DO (not EOF) (пока не конец входного файла) DO (i=1,…,n) mas[i].p:=0 OD DO (i=1,…,n) mas[w[i]].p:= mas[w[i]].p +1 OD (частоты встречи символов в окне) DO (i=1,…,n) mas[w[i]].p:= mas[w[i]].p/n OD (вероятности символов в окне) Сортировка(mas) DO (i=1,…,n) (определяем количество IF (mas[i].p=0) OD ненулевых вероятностей) OD Huffman(i,P) (строим код Хаффмана) C:=Read( ) (читаем следующий символ из файла) Write(mas[C].code) (код символа – в выходной файл) DO (i=1,…,n-1) w[i]:= w[i+1] OD w[n]:=C (включаем в окно текущий символ) OD","output":"# Реализация адаптивного кода Хаффмана на Python class Node: def __init__(self, symbol, freq): self.symbol = symbol self.freq = freq self.left = None self.right = None def build_huffman_tree(mas): nodes = [Node(symbol, freq) for symbol, freq in mas.items()] while len(nodes) > 1: nodes.sort(key=lambda x: x.freq) left = nodes.pop(0) right = nodes.pop(0) new_node = Node(None, left.freq + right.freq) new_node.left = left new_node.right = right nodes.append(new_node) return nodes[0] def assign_codes(root, code): if root.symbol is not None: mas[root.symbol].code = code return assign_codes(root.left, code + \\"0\\") assign_codes(root.right, code + \\"1\\") n = 256 mas = {i: {'p': 0, 'code': ''} for i in range(n)} w = [0]*n # Заполняем окно символами алфавита for i in range(n): w[i] = i # Чтение входного файла input_file = open(\\"input.txt\\", \\"r\\") output_file = open(\\"output.txt\\", \\"w\\") while True: for i in range(n): mas[i]['p'] = 0 for i in range(n): mas[w[i]]['p'] += 1 for i in range(n): mas[w[i]]['p'] /= n sorted_mas = sorted(mas.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['p']) for i in range(n): if mas[i]['p'] == 0: break huffman_root = build_huffman_tree({i: freq for i, (freq, _) in enumerate(sorted_mas)}) assign_codes(huffman_root, \\"\\") c = input_file.read(1) if not c: break output_file.write(mas[ord(c)]['code']) for i in range(n-1): w[i] = w[i+1] w[n-1] = ord(c) input_file.close() output_file.close()"},{"instruction":"Что такое code в следующем коде: code = [\\"alpha\\", \\"beta\\", \\"gamma\\", \\"delta\\", \\"epsilon\\"] s_in = \\"hello\\" s_out = \\"\\" S = \\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\\" l = len(s_in) for i in range(l): T = S.index(s_in[i]) s_out += code[T] stmp = S[T] S = S[:T] + S[T+1:] print(s_out)","output":"В данном коде переменная \`code\` представляет собой список строк, содержащих различные кодовые слова.

A single spotlight catches his confident smile as he waves to the crowd, the roar of their cheers setting the tone for a night of bellyache laughs—an evening where, as Matt puts it, he'll reveal his \\"most naked truth.\\" He starts off strong, losing no time in warming up the crowd with sharp wit and stories from Hollywood’s glittering, treacherous slopes. But as he weaves through his set, he primes the audience for what he calls \\"the tale of the unholy dip.\\" Cue the flashback. It’s a breezy Sunday morning, Matt tells the audience, and he's feeling adventurous, craving solace away from the urban cacophony. Hungering for nature's embrace, he finds his way to a secluded pond he’d heard about from an enigmatic Uber driver who swore by its rejuvenating properties. “There I am, waltzing into the woods like I’m freakin’ Snow White,” Matt recounts, “except instead of singing birds, it’s the buzzing of confused mosquitoes.” The audience giggles and squirms, hanging on to every description. Matt sets the scene with a vivid panorama: the pond is an idyllic mirror reflecting the green whispers of foreboding trees, the water still and seemingly untouched. After making sure he's alone—emphasizing his surveillance of the vicinity with night-goggle hands gesturing around his eyes—he decides to bare it all. “Clothes are just society's handcuffs, and I was about to pull a Houdini,” he grins, and with that, he takes the metaphorical plunge, detailing the shock of the cool water against his city-tempered skin. Now reclining in the water with comedic pomp, he mimes a serene artiste, savoring the secluded haven. The audience is transported, enraptured by this intimate encounter with Mother Nature. A squirmy delight ripples through the crowd as they await the inevitable punchline. And then, with a mischievous twinkle, Matt lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “Folks, what I did next would make even Poseidon plug his nose.” A faint plop sound effect echoes through the theater speakers, perfectly timed. Matt contorts his face, miming the introspective regret one has after letting rip the fateful fart that would become the stuff of legend. The theater erupts, as people clutch their sides, teetering in their seats. \\"As I bask in my natural essence,\\" Matt chuckles, \\"I notice the water getting...calmer. Eerily calm. Like, 'someone-should-check-the-fish’ calm.\\" He talks of the creeping dread, the slow realization that what he assumed to be tiny ripples from his own aquatic disturbance was actually the fish, surrendering to the funk. “It’s like the seas parted, but instead of Moses, it was my colon!” The crowd is howling now, tears streaming down faces as Matt paints the absurd picture of fish floating belly up, a testament to his lethal flatulence. \\"Can you imagine the real estate value plummeting? You can't sell a pond where fish die of second-hand digestion!\\" Matt mimes giving CPR to a fish, lips puckered, punctuating his valiant, fictitious effort to resuscitate aquatic life with puffed cheeks and faux heroism. He spins the story, claiming he’s been on the lam ever since, a fugitive blamed for an ecological disaster rivaling an oil spill. “I’m not saying I’m banned from SeaWorld,” he quips in mock-seriousness, while pantomiming holding a blowhole shut, “but let's just say Shamu doesn't want to swim with me anymore.” With his tale winding down, Matt takes a solemn bow. “In the end, kids, the moral of the story is: 'Beans, beans, they're good for your heart, but in the pond, they'll make fish depart.'\\" As the waves of laughter subside, the beams of the spotlight scatter to reveal Matt Rife, standing victorious amidst a sea of applause. Matt’s tale of the pond-turned-tomb leaves an indelible mark—a comedian's epic fable that will be whispered with giggles long after the curtain falls."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To create this analogy, we'd imagine the main characteristics and technologies of data centers from these eras and translate them into features that could be represented through truck design. Here's a stylized vision: **2010 Data Center Truck:** - **Model:** This truck might resemble a sturdy and reliable model from the late 2000s, not the latest in terms of design, but known for its solid performance. - **Engine:** It would likely have a traditional diesel engine, representing the standard power systems of data centers before the wide adoption of energy-efficient and green technologies. - **Exterior:** The truck might have a bulky design, echoing the physical footprint of earlier data centers with large, space-consuming servers and cooling equipment. - **Paint and Decals:** The paint could reflect the corporate branding of major tech companies of the era with decals symbolizing server racks and popular data center technologies like virtualization. - **Cooling System:** An oversized cooling system would be prominent, showcasing the importance of temperature control in the data centers of that time. - **Interior (Driver's Cabin):** Inside, there might be a lot of switches and indicators, mirroring the manual management and monitoring methods before the advent of advanced data center infrastructure management (DCIM) tools. **2014 Data Center Truck:** - **Model:** This would look more modern, with hints of aerodynamic design improvements, representing the incremental advancements in technology and efficiency made over the four years. - **Engine:** The truck might be a hybrid, combining traditional diesel with some form of electric power, symbolizing the beginning shift towards more sustainable power solutions in data centers, like better UPS systems or even on-site renewable energy sources. - **Exterior:** It could have a sleeker design, with more integration of components, suggesting the consolidation of servers and the use of blade servers, which pack more computing power into less space. - **Paint and Decals:** The branding would include references to cloud technologies and big data, which gained prominence around this time, with icons representing virtualization and the cloud. - **Cooling System:** The cooling setup would look more sophisticated, indicating improvements in hot/cold aisle containment and other efficient cooling strategies in data centers. - **Interior (Driver's Cabin):** Expect fewer manual controls and more screens, with advanced telemetry and GPS systems, parallel to the introduction of more robust DCIM systems, automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT) in data center management. It's important to note that significant changes in data center technologies can take place over four years, but many core components evolve gradually. In the truck analogy, while changes would be noticeable, there wouldn't be a drastic transformation in the basic structure or function of the vehicle."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Computers from that era were composed of larger, bulkier components and typically had simpler and less densely packed internals. Here's what the fly might encounter on its journey: 1. **Motherboard**: This large circuit board would be the main area the fly might hover over. Unlike today's motherboards, it would have had fewer integrated components and a more spacious layout. 2. **Processor (CPU)**: The CPU would be much simpler than today's microprocessors, with far fewer transistors. This would be socketed on the motherboard and might have a heatsink, but often no fan, as processors then didn't generate as much heat as modern ones do. 3. **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: The fly would see the RAM sticks, which would be fewer in number and have much lower capacity (megabytes, not gigabytes). The RAM chips themselves would be much larger physically than today's compact modules. 4. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: This component would look somewhat familiar, albeit larger and with fewer safety features compared to modern standards. Its cables would power the various components inside the case. 5. **Expansion Cards**: The fly might weave between various expansion cards like a video card, sound card, and network card. These would be larger and insert into the motherboard via slots like ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) or later on, PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect). 6. **Storage**: Depending on the era, the fly could encounter a floppy disk drive, a hard disk drive, or even a tape drive. These devices would be quite large. The hard drives would have relatively small capacities (typically measured in megabytes) and would be much bulkier than today's drives. 7. **Optical Drives**: It’s possible the computer would have a CD-ROM drive, as they started to become common in the late 1980s, although they were not standard on all machines. 8. **Cabling**: There would be a lot of bulky parallel and serial cables connecting different components, like the keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals. 9. **Cooling**: Cooling would be minimal, with maybe only the power supply having a fan. The fly wouldn't find as many fans or sophisticated cooling solutions as are present in modern PCs. 10. **Ports**: On the back of the computer case, the fly might exit through a variety of large connectors for peripherals, including serial ports, parallel ports, and perhaps a VGA or composite monitor output. The layout and components would vary based on the computer's make and model, but overall, everything would be less miniaturized and less integrated than in today's systems. The fly would likely find it much easier to navigate through the spacious innards of a 1989 computer than the densely packed and miniaturized interior of a 2020s computer."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In English, \\"retard\\" first appeared in the 15th century and was used as a verb in the sense of holding back, delaying, or slowing down something in its process or development. Over time, the noun form evolved to describe someone or something that was slowed or delayed in development, particularly in the context of mental development. However, it is important to note that the term \\"retard\\" as a noun has become considered offensive and insensitive when used to refer to individuals with intellectual disabilities. Society has moved towards more respectful language, such as \\"intellectual disability\\" or \\"developmental disability,\\" when referring to such conditions.

The name \\"Ohio\\" is derived from the Seneca word \\"ohi:yo’,\\" which means \\"good river,\\" \\"great river,\\" or \\"large creek.\\" This name was used in reference to the Ohio River, which flows through or along the borders of several U.S. states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois. When European settlers and explorers came into contact with this region, they adopted the name from the indigenous people for both the river and the territory around it. Eventually, when the state was formed, it also took the name \\"Ohio.\\" The state of Ohio was admitted to the United States as the 17th state in 1803. The etymology of the name reflects the importance of the river to the indigenous peoples and later to the settlers of the region. The Ohio River was a major transportation and trade route, playing a critical role in the westward expansion of the United States."},{"instruction":"What is the etymology of \\"Chicago\\"?","output":"The etymology of \\"Chicago\\" derives from a word in the language of the Native American Miami-Illinois people. The original word is \\"Shikaakwa\\" (written as \\"Chicaugou\\" in its early recorded forms by French explorers and settlers), which translates to \\"wild onion\\" or \\"wild garlic.\\" These plants were abundant in the region, and the name likely referred to the smell of these wild onions or the area where they grew along the shores of Lake Michigan. Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, often regarded as the first non-Native American permanent settler in the area of present-day Chicago, is credited with establishing a trading post in the region during the late 18th century. By the early 19th century, the name \\"Chicago\\" had become the generally accepted designation for the growing settlement. The fortification and settlement that later turned into the city of Chicago officially adopted the name, and Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837. Over time, the area transitioned from a small trading post into one of the largest and most significant cities in the United States."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Q: \\"Where can I find the best Chinese restaurant?\\" - D1: \\"The best Italian restaurant is near the river bank.\\" - D2: \\"Enjoy the best Chinese cuisine in our award-winning restaurant.\\" - D3: \\"Finding a good restaurant can be challenging.\\" 我们首先使用一个预先训练的模型对这些句子进行嵌入，为了简化说明，假设每个句子都嵌入为一个二维空间的向量： - Q_vec: (0.8, 0.6) - D1_vec: (0.1, -0.2) - D2_vec: (0.9, 0.65) - D3_vec: (-0.3, -0.1) 然后，我们计算查询向量与每个文档向量的余弦相似度： 余弦相似度计算公式如下： ![余弦相似度公式](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2c7bad6ab175e31d1f5e6e68592ff703bc600355) 其中，A 和 B 是两个向量，分别用来表示查询和文档。A·B 是两个向量的点积，||A|| 和 ||B|| 是两个向量的欧几里得范数（长度）。 我们对于 Q 与各个 D 进行计算： - Cosine(Q, D1) = (0.8 * 0.1 + 0.6 * -0.2) / (sqrt(0.8^2 + 0.6^2) * sqrt(0.1^2 + (-0.2)^2)) ≈ -0.03 - Cosine(Q, D2) = (0.8 * 0.9 + 0.6 * 0.65) / (sqrt(0.8^2 + 0.6^2) * sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.65^2)) ≈ 0.983 - Cosine(Q, D3) = (0.8 * -0.3 + 0.6 * -0.1) / (sqrt(0.8^2 + 0.6^2) * sqrt((-0.3)^2 + (-0.1)^2)) ≈ -0.762 基于这些计算结果，我们可以看到 Q 与 D2 的余弦相似度最高，接近 1，这表明 D2 与查询句子 Q 在语义上最相似。因此，如果我们要从这些文档中选出最匹配查询 Q 的文档，我们会选择 D2。 在实际应用中，这些计算将在更高维度的空间中进行，并可能涉及大量文档，但基本原理是相似的：我们寻找与查询向量余弦相似度最高的文档向量。"},{"instruction":"请对以下问题语句进行细致的分类：问题 上周一小B小车净毛利前三的城市的营销资损金额和营销资损率系几？ 上个月小拉月累计配对订单量TOP10的城市的月累计总补贴金额和月累计用户订单补贴率分别是？ 上周二企业的配对订单量Top 10城市的配对GTV，及配对GTV% 上个月小B的9米6的月累计单均订单毛利额最少的3个城市的月累计订单毛利率和yoy 上个月配对订单量Top 10的城市的独立需求配对率，及独立需求配对率的MOM 昨天货运小车单量前三的城市的响应率和配对率分别是多少 上个月货运小车配对订单量Top 10的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY 昨天小拉订单量最差的5个城市的单量、GTv、独立需求配对率、补贴 上个月小拉配对订单量Top 10的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY 上个月货运跨城配对订单量Top 10的城市的配对GTV，及配对GTV% 昨天小拉独立需求订单量前三的城市的预付响应率和预付配对率分别是多少 上个月小拉月累计配对订单量TOP10的城市的月累计总补贴金额和月累计用户订单补贴率分别是？ 上周四零担配对订单量最少的城市的客单价和Wow 上个月小B的9米6的月累计单均订单毛利额最少的3个城市的月累计订单毛利率和yoy 上个月零担配对订单量最多的城市的客单价和MOM 2月份货运跨城日均独立需求配对率Top 10的城市的配对订单量，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY 上个月小车独立需求配对率最高的城市的配对订单量，及独立需求配对率，以及这两个指标的MOM。 上个月小车配对订单量Top 5的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY 昨天小车客诉率最高的大区的订单量，及订单量的WOW。 4月份配对GTV最多的城市的客诉率和客诉率YOY。 昨天小车配对订单量破峰的城市的GTV是多少 昨天大车配对订单量破峰的城市的GTV，和GTV占比 昨天小车配对订单量破峰的城市，并给出这些城市的预付取消率 昨天货运小车净新增车贴数的周同比 上周五小拉的净毛利率的周同比是多少 上周日后市场单量的wow 这周一汽销客单价和GTV的周同比分别系？ 去年11月企业和小B月日均下单里程中位数的月环比 最近七天每天小B小车的独立需求配对率（快车）、独立需求配对率（快车）WOW、客单价、客单价 WOW 第二季度小B每个月的月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致电率、月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致电率MOM、月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致电率YOY 昨天哪个大区的预付执行订单量最高？ 上周小车配对订单量最高是哪天？ 第一季度里，小B小车下单用户数最高那天的下单用户数是多少？ 上周五小B微面哪个城市的独立需求订单量最差？ 这周三小B哪个车型的新司机数最多？ 最近6个月，货运小车华南哪个月的月日均到付响应率最高？ 昨天跑腿深圳的配对GTV占华南配对GTV的比例 这周二小B中货的佛山、北京的订单量占所在大区的比例分别是多少 上周五货运跨城各个大区的资损GTV、资损GTV占比、毛利、毛利占比 上个月小B货车汇总各个大区的月累计独立需求订单GTV、月累计独立需求订单GTV占比 最近3天小B三轮车各个城市的预付执行单、预付执行单占比、独立需求单、独立需求单占比","output":"为了清晰地对上述问题句子进行分类，我们可以基于提出问题的内容、数据范围、指标和目标维度对它们进行组织。以下是这些问题句子的一个细致分类： 时间范围： 1. 昨天 2. 上周（特定日子如周一、周二等） 3. 上个月 4. 本季度/上季度 5. 特定月份（如2月份、4月份等） 6. 最近七天/最近3天 7. 去年特定月份 指标类型： 1. 订单量与订单特质（如配对订单量、独立需求订单量等） 2. 经济指标（如净毛利、补贴金额、客诉率、GTV、毛利率等） 3. 绩效指标（如响应率、配对率、取消率等） 4. 市场排名指标（如Top 10城市、最差的城市/大区等） 5. 成长比率（如月环比MOM、年同比YOY、周同比WOW等） 数据维度： 1. 地域（城市、大区） 2. 特定车型（如小车、大车、小拉、小B等） 3. 订单类型（如货运小车、跨城配对订单等） 根据以上的分类框架，我们可以对问题句子进行分组。例如： -

Here's how they can be applied and why they are useful in this context: 1. Semantic Analysis: LLMs can assist threat hunters by analyzing and understanding the context of text within logs, communications, and even malware code comments, looking for indications of compromise, malicious intent, or security incidents. 2. Anomaly Detection: By training on datasets of normal system logs and communication, LLMs can learn what typical patterns look like. When new data comes in that deviates from these patterns, the model can flag it for further investigation. 3. Phishing Detection: LLMs can help in detecting phishing attempts by analyzing the language used in emails or social media communications, spotting signals that are commonly associated with phishing, such as urgent requests for information, semantic anomalies, or familiar-but-off branding. 4. Threat Intelligence: LLMs can digest vast amounts of threat intelligence from various sources and produce concise reports or summaries that would take human analysts much more time to compile. This synthesis of knowledge helps threat hunters stay informed about the latest threats and techniques. 5. Predictive Analysis: Based on historical data, LLMs can make informed predictions about potential future threats or the evolution of current incidents. This helps organizations proactively adjust their defenses before new or more sophisticated attacks occur. 6. Incident Response: During an incident, LLMs might assist in automating some parts of the response or providing initial recommendations for mitigation based on the natural language descriptions of the incidents, speeding up the time it takes for human analysts to act. 7. Malware Analysis: For a more technical application, LLMs can also be useful in categorizing and understanding malware. By analyzing the strings or even the code within a malware sample, LLMs can help in predicting its functionality, potential impact, or family lineage. 8. Automated Hunting Queries: LLMs could generate hypothesis-driven queries for SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools. Based on the context, the model might suggest various logs to inspect or particular events to correlate, thus aiding in the discovery of covert threats. When using LLMs in threat hunting, it is crucial for analysts to remember that the model's outputs should not be accepted blindly. Human expertise is necessary to contextualize and validate the findings due to the potential of false positives and the sometimes unpredictable behavior of LLMs. Integrating machine learning models as part of a broader security strategy, and using them to augment the capabilities of human analysts, can significantly enhance an organization's ability to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats."},{"instruction":"Cyber Threat Hunting vs Threat Hunting","output":"The terms \\"Cyber Threat Hunting\\" and \\"Threat Hunting\\" are often used interchangeably and essentially refer to the same proactive security process. However, if we were to differentiate between the two in a broader context, here's how they can be interpreted: **Threat Hunting:** In a broad sense, threat hunting could include looking for various kinds of threats, not limited to cyber. For instance, threat hunting could theoretically apply to physical security operations where security teams proactively look for potential threats to physical assets, individuals, or infrastructure. It can encompass a wider range of activities aimed at preemptively identifying potential threats that may compromise safety or security. **Cyber Threat Hunting:** The term \\"Cyber Threat Hunting\\" clearly defines the scope within the cyber domain. It is the process of proactively and iteratively searching through networks, endpoints, and datasets to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. This term is specifically about identifying hidden cyber threats that might be lurking undetected within an organization's IT infrastructure. In the context of IT and cybersecurity, when people refer to \\"threat hunting,\\" they are typically talking about \\"cyber threat hunting.\\" The process involves skilled security analysts using a combination of manual and automated techniques, including the use of advanced analytical tools and threat intelligence, to find malicious activity that has managed to bypass traditional security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software. Regardless of the terminology, the overarching goal of threat hunting in cybersecurity is to find and mitigate threats before they can cause significant damage to an organization’s digital assets, thus reducing the organization’s risk and enhancing its security posture."},{"instruction":"Could you explain more about LLM in Cyber Threat Hunting?","output":"Certainly! Let's delve deeper into Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3 in the context of Cyber Threat Hunting. **Cyber Threat Hunting** involves searching through networks, systems, and data for signs of malicious activities that have evaded traditional security defenses. This proactive security process is generally carried out by skilled analysts who utilize a range of techniques and tools to uncover hidden threats. LLMs come into play in the following ways within Cyber Threat Hunting: 1. **Data Enrichment and Analysis**: Cyber threat hunting involves sifting through vast amounts of data, such as logs, network traffic, and endpoint data to identify anomalies. LLMs can be trained to help categorize and filter this data, enriching it by adding context and highlighting potential areas of concern. For example, an LLM can read through DNS query logs and flag unusual domain names that might indicate command and control (C2) activity. 2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Cyber Threat Hunting can sometimes involve the analysis of unstructured text found in logs, emails, or the web. LLMs are adept at processing natural language and can help by extracting relevant information, summarizing contents, and recognizing suspicious patterns in the language used, such as in phishing attempts. 3. **Threat Intelligence Gathering**: LLMs can aggregate and synthesize threat intelligence from various sources by consuming articles, reports, threat feeds, and other textual information. This synthesis can help in identifying new attack signatures or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that could be used by adversaries. 4. **Generating Hypotheses**: A crucial aspect of threat hunting is forming hypotheses about potential threats. LLMs can assist in generating these hypotheses by using historic incident data and current threat intelligence to suggest likely attack vectors or systems that may be at risk. 5. **Automation of Queries**: LLMs can learn from patterns and analyst behaviors to suggest custom queries that can be used in SIEM tools or other data analysis platforms. These suggestions can help in uncovering otherwise hard-to-detect activities by directing analysts towards the most promising data points. 6. **Behavioral Anomalies Identification**: By learning what normal user and device behavior looks like, LLMs can help identify anomalies that might indicate malicious activity. This includes things like unusual login times, abnormal data transmission volumes, or patterns of access to sensitive resources. 7. **Malware Analysis**: When analyzing malware samples, LLMs can assist in quickly identifying the purpose, potential impact, or family of a malware sample by processing the associated strings, comments, or metadata. 8. **Automating Incident Reports**: After an incident is detected, LLMs can help draft initial incident reports, which can then be refined by human analysts. This speeds up documentation and ensures that key details are included from the outset. 9. **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**: By understanding typical behaviors, an LLM can contribute to UEBA systems that flag outliers and anomalies which could indicate a threat, such as lateral movement within the network. While LLMs offer various advantages in cyber threat hunting and have the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the process, it is essential to use them as an augmentative tool rather than a replacement for human analysts. This is because LLMs can sometimes generate false positives, misinterpret complex data, or lack the contextual awareness that human experts possess. Thus, integrating these models into a cybersecurity workflow should be done thoughtfully, with considerations for oversight and validation of the outputs provided by the LLM."},{"instruction":"请以下每条问题语句进行聚类：问题 上周一小B小车净毛利前三的城市的营销资损金额和营销资损率系几？ 上个月小拉月累计配对订单量TOP10的城市的月累计总补贴金额和月累计用户订单补贴率分别是？ 上周二企业的配对订单量Top 10城市的配对GTV，及配对GTV% 上个月小B的9米6的月累计单均订单毛利额最少的3个城市的月累计订单毛利率和yoy 上个月配对订单量Top 10的城市的独立需求配对率，及独立需求配对率的MOM 昨天货运小车单量前三的城市的响应率和配对率分别是多少 上个月货运小车配对订单量Top 10的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY 昨天小拉订单量最差的5个城市的单量、GTv、独立需求配对率、补贴 上个月小拉配对订单量Top 10的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY 上个月货运跨城配对订单量Top 10的城市的配对GTV，及配对GTV% 昨天小拉独立需求订单量前三的城市的预付响应率和预付配对率分别是多少 上个月小拉月累计配对订单量TOP10的城市的月累计总补贴金额和月累计用户订单补贴率分别是？ 上周四零担配对订单量最少的城市的客单价和Wow 上个月小B的9米6的月累计单均订单毛利额最少的3个城市的月累计订单毛利率和yoy 上个月零担配对订单量最多的城市的客单价和MOM 2月份货运跨城日均独立需求配对率Top 10的城市的配对订单量，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY 上个月小车独立需求配对率最高的城市的配对订单量，及独立需求配对率，以及这两个指标的MOM。 上个月小车配对订单量Top 5的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY 昨天小车客诉率最高的大区的订单量，及订单量的WOW。 4月份配对GTV最多的城市的客诉率和客诉率YOY。 昨天小车配对订单量破峰的城市的GTV是多少 昨天大车配对订单量破峰的城市的GTV，和GTV占比 昨天小车配对订单量破峰的城市，并给出这些城市的预付取消率 昨天货运小车净新增车贴数的周同比 上周五小拉的净毛利率的周同比是多少 上周日后市场单量的wow 这周一汽销客单价和GTV的周同比分别系？ 去年11月企业和小B月日均下单里程中位数的月环比 最近七天每天小B小车的独立需求配对率（快车）、独立需求配对率（快车）WOW、客单价、客单价 WOW 第二季度小B每个月的月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致电率、月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致电率MOM、月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致电率YOY 昨天哪个大区的预付执行订单量最高？ 上周小车配对订单量最高是哪天？ 第一季度里，小B小车下单用户数最高那天的下单用户数是多少？ 上周五小B微面哪个城市的独立需求订单量最差？ 这周三小B哪个车型的新司机数最多？ 最近6个月，货运小车华南哪个月的月日均到付响应率最高？ 昨天跑腿深圳的配对GTV占华南配对GTV的比例 这周二小B中货的佛山、北京的订单量占所在大区的比例分别是多少 上周五货运跨城各个大区的资损GTV、资损GTV占比、毛利、毛利占比 上个月小B货车汇总各个大区的月累计独立需求订单GTV、月累计独立需求订单GTV占比 最近3天小B三轮车各个城市的预付执行单、预付执行单占比、独立需求单、独立需求单占比","output":"为了更好地理解和回答这些问题，我们可以尝试根据问题的主题和相似的业务指标将它们进行聚类。以下是可能的聚类方式： **1. 城市层面数据对比** - 上周一小B小车净毛利前三的城市的营销资损金额和营销资损率系几？ - 上个月小拉月累计配对订单量TOP10的城市的月累计总补贴金额和月累计用户订单补贴率分别是？ - 上周二企业的配对订单量Top 10城市的配对GTV，及配对GTV% - 上个月小B的9米6的月累计单均订单毛利额最少的3个城市的月累计订单毛利率和yoy - 昨天货运小车单量前三的城市的响应率和配对率分别是多少 - 上个月货运小车配对订单量Top 10的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY - 昨天小拉订单量最差的5个城市的单量、GTv、独立需求配对率、补贴 - 上个月小拉配对订单量Top 10的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY - 上个月货运跨城配对订单量Top 10的城市的配对GTV，及配对GTV% - 昨天小拉独立需求订单量前三的城市的预付响应率和预付配对率分别是多少 - 上个月小拉月累计配对订单量TOP10的城市的月累计总补贴金额和月累计用户订单补贴率分别是？ **2. 时间段数据对比** - 上周四零担配对订单量最少的城市的客单价和Wow - 上个月零担配对订单量最多的城市的客单价和MOM - 2月份货运跨城日均独立需求配对率Top 10的城市的配对订单量，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY - 上个月小车独立需求配对率最高的城市的配对订单量，及独立需求配对率，以及这两个指标的MOM。 - 上个月小车配对订单量Top 5的城市的日均独立需求配对率，及日均独立需求配对率的YOY - 昨天小车客诉率最高的大区的订单量，及订单量的WOW。 - 4月份配对GTV最多的城市的客诉率和客诉率YOY。 **3. 特殊事件或峰值数据分析** - 昨天小车配对订单量破峰的城市的GTV是多少 - 昨天大车配对订单量破峰的城市的GTV，和GTV占比 - 昨天小车配对订单量破峰的城市，并给出这些城市的预付取消率 **4. 同比或环比数据分析** - 昨天货运小车净新增车贴数的周同比 - 上周五小拉的净毛利率的周同比是多少 - 上周日后市场单量的wow - 这周一汽销客单价和GTV的周同比分别系？ - 去年11月企业和小B月日均下单里程中位数的月环比 **5. 特定时间段的细分数据分析** - 最近七天每天小B小车的独立需求配对率（快车）、独立需求配对率（快车）WOW、客单价、客单价 WOW - 第二季度小B每个月的月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致电率、月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致电率MOM、月累计响应一分钟内隐私号致单率YOY **6. 高峰或低迷时间点** - 昨天哪个大区的预付执行订单量最高？ - 上周小车配对订单量最高是哪天？ - 第一季度里，小B小车下单用户数最高那天的下单用户数是多少？ - 上周五小B微面哪个城市的独立需求订单量最差？ - 这周三小B哪个车型的新司机数最多？ - 最近6个月，货运小车华南哪个月的月日均到付响应率最高？ **7. 特定区域、车型或业务线的分析** - 昨天跑腿深圳的配对GTV占华南配对GTV的比例 - 这周二小B中货的佛山、北京的订单量占所在大区的比例分别是多少 - 上周五货运跨城各个大区的资损GTV、资损GTV占比、毛利、毛利占比 - 上个月小B货车汇总各个大区的月累计独立需求订单GTV、月累计独立需求订单GTV占比 - 最近3天小B三轮车各个城市的预付执行单、预付执行单占比、独立需求单、独立需求单占比 这只是一种聚类方式，实际上可以根据不同的分析目标选择不同的聚类标准。"},{"instruction":"Закодируй в lz77 строку abracad","output":"Encoded using LZ77: (0,0,a)(0,0,b)(2,3,r)(4,3,c)(1,2,d)"},{"instruction":"Закодируй в lz77 строку abracad с размером словаря 16 бит и буфером 7 бит","output":"Для кодирования строки \\"abracad\\" с размером словаря 16 бит и буфером 7 бит сначала разделим строку на словарь и буфер: Словарь: \\"abracad\\" Буфер: \\"\\" Теперь приступим к кодированию с учетом размеров словаря и буфера: 1.

However, I will try to provide a comparison based on their functions and performance in their respective categories. The Samsung Galaxy S, an Android smartphone, was released in 2010 and was among the most advanced smartphones of its time. However, by modern standards, it is considered outdated, with limited processing power, RAM, storage, and an outdated version of the Android operating system that no longer receives updates. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, on the other hand, is a smartwatch launched in 2022. It is designed to be a companion device to smartphones, with a focus on fitness tracking, notifications, and other quick interactions. It runs on Wear OS powered by Samsung, features advanced health-tracking sensors, and has a more powerful processor, more RAM, and better overall performance than the Galaxy S smartphone. In terms of pure performance, the Galaxy Watch 5 is vastly superior to the original Galaxy S smartphone due to being over a decade newer, with modern hardware and software. It's designed to operate smoothly with contemporary apps and services, whereas the Galaxy S would struggle or be incompatible with most modern applications. However, it's also worth noting that the Galaxy Watch 5's functionality is different from that of a smartphone. While it may perform better within the scope of its design (as a smartwatch), it cannot do everything a smartphone can, such as taking photos or running full-fledged smartphone apps. In summary, the Galaxy Watch 5 is much more advanced and performs better than the Galaxy S1 in the context of smartwatch capabilities. But being entirely different kinds of devices, they're not directly comparable in terms of overall functionality."},{"instruction":"In 700-750 words (approx 2 pages), write a reflection on these questions: What is the role of the one night stand in these four narratives (Young Adult, Medicine For Melancholy, Trainwreck, Mary Goes Round) What are the repercussions? How do these casual sex encounters differ from The Kissing Booth and Edge of Seventeen? How are the sober hookups in Single Drunk Female scripted/visualized differently than hookups in other films we've watched this semester? Is storytelling a part of the college hook up culture that you’ve experienced? If so, are these stories entertaining? Are there repercussions in these stories similar to those in the above films? Do you feel that the observations made in The Pleasures of Drunken One Night Stand research article (i.e. \\"...part of the pleasure of one-night stands is not sexual experiences per se, but that they offer good material for storytelling\\") are observations that could apply to the campus culture at Notre Dame? Watch Young Adult (94 min) Watch Medicine For Melancholy (88 min) Watch Single Drunk Female (S1 Ep. 4 and Ep. 5) (21 min ea, ABC.com or Hulu) Read Pleasures of Drunken One Night Stand (Article in Canvas Files)","output":"The one night stand, a pivotal motif in contemporary narratives, serves various roles ranging from a plot catalyst to a character-defining moment, as seen in \\"Young Adult,\\" \\"Medicine For Melancholy,\\" \\"Trainwreck,\\" and \\"Mary Goes Round.\\" These instances of casual intimacy differ substantially in their repercussions and narrative significance when compared to more romantically inclined films like \\"The Kissing Booth\\" and \\"Edge of Seventeen.\\" In \\"Young Adult,\\" the protagonist Mavis engages in a one night stand with her ex-boyfriend, which exposes her inability to move past her high school glory days. Here, the encounter is less about fleeting pleasure and more a window into Mavis's deep-seated emotional stagnation. This act sets off a series of awkward and painful interactions, emphasizing her estrangement from adult responsibility. \\"Medicine For Melancholy\\" uses the one night stand not as an end but rather as an initiation into an exploration of race, gentrification, and identity. The casual encounter between Micah and Joanne transforms into a 24-hour conversation and impromptu relationship, juxtaposing personal connection against the backdrop of a changing San Francisco. On a different note, \\"Trainwreck\\" remixes the traditional rom-com narrative by presenting Amy as a woman who embraces her sexuality without apology. While her one night stands initially appear to be without consequence, they actually afford Amy a false sense of control, which eventually unravels, pushing her towards personal growth and a more profound understanding of intimacy. \\"Mary Goes Round\\" portrays the lead character's one night stand as a symptom of her spiraling alcoholism and avoidance of deeper personal issues. It leads to professional and personal repercussions, spotlighting the delicate interplay between self-destructive behaviors and the search for connection. Comparatively, \\"The Kissing Booth\\" and \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" offer a more sanitized perspective on intimacy, where sexual encounters are either framed within the context of budding romance or as pivotal learning experiences on the brink of adulthood. The consequences are less harsh and are often tied to sentimental education rather than causing real devastation in the characters' lives. Turning to \\"Single Drunk Female,\\" sober hookups are depicted with a different level of consciousness and deliberateness than those seen in other narratives. Here, sobriety adds a layer of vulnerability and significance to sexual encounters, stripping away the escapist element often provided by alcohol. This honest representation challenges characters to confront their decisions and the emotional weight they carry, without the hazy veil of inebriation. In terms of college culture, storytelling about hookups can indeed be prevalent, where recounting tales of one night stands often becomes part of social bonding or even social currency. These stories can be entertaining for some, yet they also bear the risk of trivializing real emotional turmoil or objectifying those involved—a repercussion echoed in the films. The article \\"The Pleasures of Drunken One Night Stand\\" suggests that narratives stemming from such encounters are valued for their entertainment rather than the experiences themselves, a sentiment that could very well resonate within the campus culture at Notre Dame. In all these examples, the one night stand is used to peel back layers of character, provoke self-reflection, and serve as a narrative device to advance the plot. They differ widely, from the embrace of momentary pleasure in \\"Trainwreck\\" to the reminder of personal failures in \\"Young Adult\\" and \\"Mary Goes Round.\\" These casual sexual encounters both embody and lay bare the complexities of human relationships, challenging characters to navigate the chasm between intimacy and loneliness. In conclusion, the casual sex encounter in modern narratives offers a rich texture for character development and thematic exploration. While the depiction of sober hookups in \\"Single Drunk Female\\" starkly contrasts with other representations, each story acknowledges the reverberating consequences of one night stands, ranging from personal insight to outright disaster. On college campuses, the act of storytelling about hookups, albeit problematic, persists as a cultural phenomenon, with shared narratives providing entertainment that may sometimes come at the expense of meaningful connections."},{"instruction":"Directions: Please write a paragraph reflecting on your class engagement so far this semester. I would like you to begin by commenting on your strengths, contributions to the learning of your classmates, and areas of growth in your participation. Second, set at least two goals for strengthening your class participation in the remainder of the semester. You may wish to use \\"Stop/Start/Continue\\" as a way to organize your goals, but you don't have to.","output":"Reflecting on my class engagement this semester, I can affirm that one of my core strengths has been my consistent preparation for our discussions. By thoroughly reading the assigned materials and viewing the films with a critical eye, I've been able to contribute insightful comments that add depth to our conversations. I am particularly proud of how I've facilitated connections between the subject matter and broader thematic issues, which I believe has been valuable for my classmates' learning as it often brings new perspectives to the fore. One of the areas where I see room for improvement is in my ability to actively listen and build upon the contributions of others. Occasionally, I might become too focused on sharing my own ideas rather than fully engaging with the points being made by my peers. To further strengthen my participation as we progress, I commit to two main goals: Firstly, I aim to 'Start' engaging more with my peers' contributions by asking follow-up questions that prompt deeper analysis and discussion. This will not only help to validate their insights but will also enable a more dynamic and interconnected classroom dialogue. Secondly, I am determined to 'Continue' my rigorous preparation for classes; however, I will 'Stop' dominating conversations to leave more space for quieter voices to emerge. I believe that by striking a better balance between speaking and listening, I can foster a more inclusive environment and gain new insights from the collective intelligence of the class. These steps will not only improve my own learning experience but should hopefully contribute to a more enriched discussion atmosphere for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"I have a script for a salesperson to use when they need to lower the price they are offering to a customer, when they say they cant afford it.

Below are 10 variations of the wording you provided, each with a slightly different nuance or focus: 1. I understand that this investment might not align with your current situation, and that's perfectly fine. However, consider if we adjusted the cost to (LOWER LEVELS)... By choosing to support us today, you're not just giving; you're actively participating in fostering a generous spirit that I believe will return to you manifold. 2. It seems that my proposal may not be the right fit at this moment, which is completely acceptable. But let's imagine we revisited the price and brought it down to (LOWER LEVELS)... By contributing today, you're making a commitment to spread kindness in the world, a virtue that often circles back to the giver in rewarding ways. 3. I'm getting the impression that what I've offered might be a bit out of reach, and that's all right. Should we consider a price adjustment to (LOWER LEVELS)...? In doing so, your support becomes a powerful act of generosity, one that, I trust, will yield positive outcomes for you as well. 4. Based on what you're saying, it sounds like my request might not be feasible, and that's completely understandable. However, what if we looked at a different level, say (LOWER LEVELS)...? This level of support would be a tangible demonstration of your generosity, potentially creating a cycle of goodwill that benefits you in return. 5. It appears that the commitment I've presented doesn't quite fit your current financial picture, which is okay. If we could make the numbers work by reducing the cost to (LOWER LEVELS)..., your support would stand as a testament to your extraordinary generosity, a quality I'm convinced has its rewards. 6. I respect that my initial proposition may not be workable at this juncture, and there's no pressure. However, if we tailor the price to (LOWER LEVELS)..., the support you give today is more than just financial; it's an act of heartfelt generosity that I believe will be reciprocated in the world around you. 7. It seems we might not be on the same page financially, and I respect that. Let's consider an alternative: what if we move forward with a figure like (LOWER LEVELS)...? In choosing to back us at this level, you're embodying generosity, which I genuinely feel will come back to you positively. 8. After hearing your concerns, it's clear that my initial ask might not be suitable for your budget right now, and I'm okay with that. If we could compromise on a reduced amount, say (LOWER LEVELS)..., I want to emphasize that your contribution is a form of generous action that often leads to positive circulations of goodwill. 9. Taking in what you've said, it's evident that the investment I'm proposing might be a bit of a stretch. No worries. Maybe we could agree on (LOWER LEVELS)... By offering your backing at this level, you're endorsing a higher level of generosity, which I believe has a positive boomerang effect. 10. I can see that the figures I've suggested may not be attainable for you at the present time, and that's perfectly fine. If you'd entertain the idea of us reducing it to (LOWER LEVELS)... though, your patronage today then becomes a pledge to advance generosity—a value that I have faith will return to you with positive benefits."},{"instruction":"dalam membuat rencana karya / disain karya seni rupa terapan toga dimensi sebagai tahap dapat dilakukan dengan kegiatan ...A.membuat karya contohB.menetapkan ukuranC.ekplorasi / mencari contoh karyaD.mencari bahan dan alatE.menggambar","output":"Dalam membuat rencana karya atau desain karya seni rupa terapan tiga dimensi, ada beberapa tahapan yang dapat dilakukan untuk mencapai hasil akhir yang diinginkan.

Di antara pilihan yang disebutkan, pilihan yang paling cocok dan pantas untuk membuat wajan adalah: B. besi, tanah liat, dan aluminium Berikut adalah penjelasan untuk setiap bahan: - Besi: Bahan ini adalah pilihan yang sangat baik untuk wajan karena besi cor atau besi tahan karat dapat meratakan panas dengan baik dan tahan terhadap penggunaan intensif. Selain itu, besi juga dapat menahan suhu panas yang tinggi tanpa mengalami kerusakan. - Tanah liat: Meskipun tidak umum digunakan untuk membuat wajan modern, tanah liat telah digunakan secara tradisional dalam peralatan memasak di beberapa budaya. Tanah liat dapat memasak dengan sangat baik dengan menggunakan panas yang rendah namun membutuhkan perawatan ekstra untuk menghindari retak atau pecah. - Aluminium: Bahan ini ringan, menghantarkan panas dengan baik, dan sering digunakan dalam pembuatan peralatan masak karena sifatnya yang anti-karat dan kemudahannya untuk dibentuk. Bahan-bahan yang tidak pantas seperti melamine dan plastik lainnya tidak tahan terhadap panas tinggi dan dapat meleleh atau menyebabkan pelepasan bahan kimia yang berbahaya ketika digunakan untuk memasak.

Para garantir a renovação política e evitar a perpetuação de elites políticas, é fundamental adotar algumas medidas, tais como: 1. Incentivar a participação de novas lideranças: é importante promover a participação de novas lideranças na política, incentivando a participação de jovens e de grupos minoritários que historicamente foram excluídos do cenário político. 2. Promover a transparência: a transparência nos processos eleitorais e na atuação dos políticos é essencial para evitar a perpetuação de elites políticas. A divulgação de informações sobre doações de campanha, gastos públicos e tomadas de decisão é fundamental para a fiscalização e accountability dos representantes. 3. Implementar mecanismos de controle e fiscalização: a criação de órgãos de controle e fiscalização eficazes, como tribunais de contas e agências reguladoras independentes, é fundamental para prevenir práticas corruptas e garantir a renovação política. 4. Estimular a diversificação de representantes: é importante promover a diversificação dos perfis dos representantes políticos, garantindo a representação de diferentes grupos sociais, étnicos, culturais e de gênero. 5. Limitar mandatos: a implementação de limites de mandatos para cargos políticos pode ser uma medida eficaz para evitar a perpetuação de elites políticas. Isso possibilita a alternância de poder e a renovação das lideranças. Em suma, garantir a renovação política e evitar a perpetuação de elites políticas requer um esforço conjunto da sociedade civil, dos partidos políticos, das instituições de controle e dos próprios representantes políticos. A busca por uma maior representatividade e diversidade no sistema político é fundamental para fortalecer a democracia e promover a justiça social."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Sayori, you excited for today’s meeting?” Sayori: “Definitely!

Idée générale du texte. Le texte traite de l’importance du dialogue et du respect envers autrui. L’idée principale est que la manière dont nous choisissons de nous adresser à quelqu’un reflète notre reconnaissance de la capacité de cette personne à comprendre et à échanger la vérité. L’auteur oppose deux façons de s’adresser aux autres : l’une est autoritaire, similaire à la manière dont on donnerait des ordres à un chien ou un esclave, tandis que l’autre est respectueuse et implique un dialogue mutuel. La seconde méthode repose sur l’égalité fondamentale de tous les êtres humains en matière de capacité à participer à la vérité et à un dialogue constructif. 2. Explication de l’expression “Un dialogue… égaux”. L’expression “Un dialogue, une discussion ne peuvent avoir lieu qu’entre égaux” souligne que l’essence même du dialogue est la reconnaissance mutuelle et respectueuse de la capacité de chaque participant à contribuer à la conversation avec de la vérité et du discernement. Cela suppose que chaque interlocuteur est libre de s’exprimer et d’être entendu sans préjudice. Un véritable dialogue n’a pas de place pour la hiérarchie ou les rapports de domination qui limiteraient la liberté d’expression de certains participants. La discussion doit se dérouler dans un environnement où les idées peuvent circuler librement et où chaque personne est valorisée pour sa contribution potentielle. Pour parvenir à cela, les conditions suivantes doivent être remplies : - Égalité de parole : Chacun doit pouvoir s’exprimer librement, sans intimidation ni suppression de la part des autres. - Égalité d’écoute : Chacun doit être disposé à écouter et considérer les points de vue des autres avec autant de sérieux que les siens. - Réceptivité mutuelle : Les participants doivent être ouverts à la possibilité que la vérité puisse émerger de l’échange, même de la part de ceux que l’on pourrait considérer comme moins qualifiés ou informés. - Absence de préjugés : Il est nécessaire de mettre de côté les préjugés pour apprécier les contributions de tous, indépendamment de leur statut ou de leur background. - Reconnaissance de la capacité : Chaque personne est présumée apporter quelque chose de juste et de vrai, basé sur la croyance que tout être humain détient le potentiel de comprendre et d’échanger des vérités. - Liberté de contestation et d’interrogation : Le dialogue repose sur la possibilité de poser des questions et de contester les opinions présentées de manière respectueuse et constructive. La maxime citée implique que le respect et la reconnaissance de la valeur de chaque personne sont des prérequis essentiels pour un dialogue authentique et significatif. 3. Étapes de l’argumentation du texte. L’argumentation du texte se déroule en plusieurs étapes : - Introduction des deux façons de s’adresser à autrui : de façon autoritaire ou en engageant un dialogue égalitaire. - Exposition de la prémisse que le dialogue ne peut se dérouler qu’en reconnaissant l’autre comme un égal, capable de liberté et de vérité. - Argumentation selon laquelle le dialogue implique une écoute mutuelle et la possibilité pour chaque participant de poser des questions et d’accepter qu’il puisse ne pas détenir toutes les réponses. - Conclusion que tous les hommes sont égaux en tant qu’ils sont capables de participer à un dialogue et à la vérité. - Exemple historique avec Platon et l’esclave du Ménon pour illustrer que l’aptitude au dialogue n’est pas restreinte par le statut social. 4. Intérêt philosophique du texte. L’intérêt philosophique du texte réside dans sa mise en lumière de la communication et de l’interaction humaines comme fondements d’une société équitable et respectueuse. Le texte pousse à réfléchir sur les principes de liberté, d’égalité et du respect de la dignité humaine. Il interroge sur la nature de la vérité et sur la manière dont elle peut être atteinte collectivement par le biais du dialogue et de l’échange d’idées. \\"En langage courant svp.\\"","output":"Bien sûr, je vais reformuler les idées en langage simple : 1. Le texte dit en gros que c'est important de parler aux gens de manière respectueuse et ouverte. Quand on parle à quelqu'un comme s'il était notre égal, ça montre qu'on croit qu'il est aussi capable de réfléchir et de comprendre des choses importantes que nous. Il ne faut pas donner des ordres aux gens comme s'ils étaient des chiens ou des esclaves, mais plutôt discuter avec eux gentiment, comme on le ferait avec quelqu'un qu'on respecte. 2. Quand on dit \\"Il faut être égal pour vraiment discuter\\", c'est pour dire que pour avoir une vraie conversation, tout le monde doit être traité de la même manière, et chacun doit pouvoir parler et se faire écouter. Il ne doit pas y avoir de chef qui décide de tout, et tout le monde doit être libre de partager ses idées et ses opinions. Pour que ça marche, il faut que : - Chacun puisse parler autant qu'il le veut. - Tout le monde écoute vraiment ce que les autres disent. - Les gens soient prêts à accepter que tout le monde peut dire quelque chose d'intelligent. - Personne ne juge les autres avant de les avoir écoutés. - Tout le monde reconnaisse que chacun peut apporter quelque chose de bien à la conversation. - Les gens puissent poser des questions et dire quand ils ne sont pas d'accord, mais toujours de manière gentille. 3. Comment le texte construit son idée : - Il commence par expliquer qu'il y a deux manières de parler aux gens : en leur donnant des ordres ou en discutant avec eux comme des égaux. - Il dit que pour vraiment discuter, il faut voir l'autre personne comme un égal, capable de penser et de trouver la vérité. - Il continue en disant qu'il faut écouter ce que les autres ont à dire, poser des questions et être prêt à accepter qu'on n'a pas toujours raison. - Il finit par dire que tous les gens sont égaux parce que tout le monde peut discuter et comprendre des choses. - Il donne l'exemple de Platon qui a montré qu'un esclave était capable de penser par lui-même et d'apprendre, pour montrer que même les gens qu'on pense moins importants peuvent être très intelligents. 4. Pourquoi ce texte est intéressant pour la philosophie : Ce texte nous fait réfléchir à comment on doit traiter les autres et parler avec eux pour créer une société juste et pleine de respect. Il nous pose des questions sur la liberté et l'égalité et nous pousse à penser à la meilleure façon de trouver des vérités ensemble, en partageant nos idées et en discutant."},{"instruction":"Doc1: Philosopher c'est chercher, c'est expliquer qu'il y a des choses à voir et a dire. Or aujourd'hui,on ne cherche guère. On revient à l'une ou à l'autre des traditions, on la défend. Nos convictions se fondent moins sur des valeurs ou des vérités aperçues que sur les vices ou les erreurs de celles dont nous ne voulons pas. Notre pensée est en retraite ou en repli. Dans ce monde où la dénégation et les passions moroses tiennent lieu de certitudes, on ne cherche surtout pas à voir, et c'est la philosophie, parce qu'elle demande à voir, qui passe pour impiété. \\"Quel est l'intérêt philosophique du texte. Reponse: L'intérêt philosophique de ce texte est que l'auteur cherche à ameliorer le point de vue de l'humanité par rapport a la philosophie qui semble etre abandonner. L'approche que l'auteur devrait essayer c'est \\"la sensibilisation des gens\\" a se consacrer a une courant philosophique qui se base sur des problèmes du futur.\\" A partir du texte ci-dessous, repondez a la meme question svp en utilisant la meme forme de la réponse ci-dessous : Texte 9: Dialogue et respect d'autrui. Il y a differentes façons de s'adresser à d'autres hommes, On peut s'adresser à un homme comme on s'adresse à un chien ou à un esclave, Simplement pour lui donner un ordre auquel il doit obéir sans le comprendre, ou qu'il peut comprendre mis n'a pas à discuter : alors on exclut que celui à qui on s'adresse ait droit à la parole parce qu'on exclut que la vérité puisse venir de lui. Mais si l'on s'adresse à lui comme a un interlocuteur, que l'on interroge et que I'on écoute qui répond, interroge, et, de toute façon, écoute, on le considère comme capable de vérité, donc libre et soi-même on se considère comme capable de vérité et libre, dès que l'on peut répondre à toute question, füt-ce en constatant simplement que l'on ne sait pas. Dans toute conversation, dans tout dialogue, chacun considère, en principe, I'autre homme comme également capable de vérité et libre, donc le considère comme un égal. Un dialogue, une discussion ne peuvent avoir lieu qu'entre égaux. Il faut que chaque participant à la discussion se sente ct se trouve avec I'autre ou les autres sur un pied d'égalité. Chacun, en effet, doit être présupposé pouvoir dire quelque chose de juste et de vrai. (...) Tous les hommes, dès lors, sont égaux, en tant qu'ayant cette capacité, ce pouvoir, de mettre en circulation la vérité. Tous les hommes pouvant participer à un dialogue ? Oui, mais tous le peuvent (en droit). Platon, dans le Ménon, choisit comme interlocuteur de Socrate un esclave, voulant montrer que l'interlocuteur peut etre n'importe qui.","output":"L'intérêt philosophique de ce texte est que l'auteur nous encourage à reconsidérer la manière dont nous interagissons avec autrui dans la communication, en soulignant l'importance fondamentale du dialogue et du respect mutuel.

Before the events of the excerpt started, the death of Chiang Kai Shek in 1975 and Mao Zedong in 1976 lead to a power struggle within both the Chinese nationalists, Han supremacist, Han nationalist Chinese Communist Party-ruled People's Republic of China ruling over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Manchuria and Shanxi since 1949, which [the PRC] Mao had [the PRC] ruled as both its [the PRC's] first and founding fascist dictator [Mao] from 1949 until his [Mao's] death and the Han nationalist, Han supremacist Leninist Stalinist Kuomingtang-ruled Nationalist China/Second Republic of China which [Nationalist China] Chiang had ruled as Generalissmo [Chiang] from 1928 and even during the period of its [Nationalist China's] exile in 1949 on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands after [Nationalist China] losing the Chinese Civil War to the CCP and what would become the PRC as Mao's chosen successor Hua Guofeng battled the post 1947, pro Soviet, pro American and pro KMT and pro Nationalist China Cantonese nationalist Clique in mainland China headed by Deng Xiaoping, which lead to East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and even Yunnan breaking away from the PRC along with Manchuria, leaving the PRC in charge of Han China alone. The Cantonese nationalist Clique in mainland China headed by Xiaoping joins forces with the KMT-lead Nationalist China in exile and launches a rebellion in Guangxi and Guangdong, although the Nationalist Chinese government in exile is forced to flee to and set up shop in the Cantonia region due to native indigenous Taiwanese resistance against the KMT rule in Taiwan, restarting the Chinese Civil War between the KMT-dominated Nationalists and the CCP-ruled PRC once more. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-rules Kumul Khanate is [the Kumul Khanate] restored [the Kumul Khanate] as the government of post-PRC East Turkestan due to a mass jihad being declared against both the CCP and the USSR helping the native Turkic Uyghur people of East Turkestan stave off Soviet invasion and occupation. In post CCP Tibet, the theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is restored as the government of the country. Central China, more specifically the area ruled by the Hui Muslim warlord family of the Mas as Xibei San Ma during the modern Chinese warlord era, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War also breaks free from Han China, [the former Xibei San Ma] restoring the Turko-Mongol Han Chinese Imperial House of Li-ruled Great Tang Empire/Tang dynasty to power as an Islamic sultanate in the model of the Arab Islamic monarchies, the Ottoman Empire and the pre Russian Empire Mongol Empire successor states in Central Asia. Facing pressure from the world due to the Vietnam War and not wanting another regional confrontation, the Americans convince the Soviets to drop all support for the KMT-lead Nationalist China in exile and also to jointly return Taiwan and the Pengu Islands to Japan in a repeat of the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. Fearing that pro-democracy protests in the joint US-PRC puppet state of the military dictatorship of the Republic of Korea occupying South Korea and the Soviet satellite state of the Worker's Party of Korea-ruled Democratic People's Republic of Korea occupying North Korea and from there spread to the USSR, thus affecting the stability of the Soviet Union, Soviet leaders also pressure the Americans to return all of the Korean peninsula to Japan with US and Soviet troops withdrawing from both the former DPRK and ROK in exchange for nonaggression treaties and an unofficial acknowledgment of the USA and USSR both starting the Second Sino Japanese War by backing Chiang Kai Shek against Japan during the Second Sino Japanese War. The Soviets also return Sahlakin and the Kurils to Japan. After the return of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, the Korean peninsula, Sahalkin and the Kurils to Japan, the Japanese restore the post-1947, pre-DPRK, pre-ROK People's Republic of Korea founded [the PRK] by Korean independence activist Lyuh Woon-hyung in 1947 before its [the PRK's] subsequent invasion by both the USSR and USA, [the Japanese restoring the PRK] as the government [the PRK] of a united, post-DPRK, post-ROK Korean peninsula with opposition pro-democracy politicians from both the now dissolved DPRK and ROK serving in the restored PRK's government. The Japanese also establish the Republic of Formosa on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, with former Imperial Japanese Army solider turned pro-democracy politician Lee Teng Hui serving as the Republic of Formosa's first president. Japan also restores its [Japan's] pre-WW2 era protectorates of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria and the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions, to the delight of the Manchus/Manchurians and Mongolians with Han Chinese settler colonists placed in these nations [Manchuria and Inner Mongolia] by the CCP during the PRC's rule fleeing to the PRC-ruled Han China. The millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on Militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society continues to grow in strength and [the Yellow Sand Society] increase membership and support and [the Yellow Sand Society] overthrown the PRC in 1980 with the help of compromised elements of the CCP, the PRC's combined land, sea and air combat forces, the People's Liberation Army, the combined protection service for the elite section of the CCP, domestic secret plice agency and border control division of the PRC, the Ministry of State Security, the paramilitary organization of the PRC's government primarily responsible for internal security, riot control, counter-terrorism, disaster response, law enforcement and maritime rights protection, the Chinese People's Armed Police, along with the Triads, who [the Triads] have [the Triads] switched from the KMT and Nationalist China to the Yellow Sand Society due to their [the Triads'] initial formation as a means to restore the Great Ming State to power in China. The CCP is [the CCP] reabsorbed into its [the CCP's] parent political organization, the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han fascist Conservative political organisation adhering to Dr Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people (or welfarism), the Young China Party [YCP], which [the YCP] was [the YCP] named after the infamous Young Turks in the now long dissolved Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Ottoman Empire, [the YCP] having followed the KMT and the ROC into exile on Taiwan in 1949 but [the YCP] returning to Han China after the PRC's overthrow by request of moderates within the PRC, [the CCP's remerger with the YCP] becoming [the CCP as part of the YCP once more] the YCP's ultra-nationalist left-wing [the CCP as part of the YCP once more] again as the YCP becomes the governing political organization [the YCP] of post-PRC Han China ruled by the Yellow Sand Society. The Yellow Sand Society is forced to compromise with the YCP, [the Yellow Sand Society] restoring the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China in the form of a restored Yuan Shikai-founded Empire of China as an Islamic sultanate under Sharia Law with the surviving descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu being reenthroned as the Chinese Imperial family in the place of Yuan Shikai's descendants, who are absorbed into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu. This restored Empire of China ruled by the Zhu instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants and is still officially referred to in English as the People's Republic of China but is referred to as the Empire of China or the Empire of the Great Ming in traditional Chinese. It flies the Beiyang Government's five-color flag with a golden-rayed, red sun version of the Nationalist China white sun emblem in the middle, uses the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China's and the initial Empire of China's twelve symbols national emblem as its national emblem, uses the Wuchang Uprising flag as its Army flag and a version of Nationalist China's iconic Bue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag with a yellow sun, red Inner rays and white outer rays as a tribute to the original Ming trade flag, a blue banner with a yellow sun with red rays. Yuan Shikai's descendants are absorbed into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu via concubine, polygamy and adoption. This restored Empire of China is a provisional authoritarian absolute Imperial unitary monarchy under military dictatorship from 1981-1985, and then a constitutional parliamentary democratic absolute federalist unitary Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections from 1986 onwards, being known as the Empire of China in both traditional Chinese and English onwards as well. The Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China has an informal tributary status with Japan akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China's final incarnation as the WW2 era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China under Sun Yat Sen's protégé and rightful heir, Wang Jingwei. Sun Yat Sen is still honored as the father of the nation and his three principles of the people play a key role in the government of the nation, but its real founders are considered to be Shikai, Jingwei and controversially Mao. Nationalist China manages to push deeper north into China and hold on to the territory, but Cantonese independence activist and pro-democracy rebels infiltrate its ranks and transform it into an independent Cantonese Republic in all but name. Nationalist China then joins SEATO and [Nationalist China] signs a peace Treaty with the Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China, the post-PRC restored Manchukuo in the post-PRC independent Manchuria and Mongolian Autonomous Federation, the post-PRC restored Kingdom of Tibet in post-PRC independent Tibet, the post-PRC restored Kumul Khanate in post-PRC East Turkestan and Japan that officially ends the Chinese Civil War and confirms the status of the post-PRC and Nationalist China successor states in the China region as sovereign independent states. Nationalist China then undergoes a mysterious coup that sees it become a restored Ming satellite state, rump kingdom and tributary kingdom of the Japanese-Han Chinese Zheng dynasty/Royal House of Koxinga-rules Tungning Kingdom with the remnants of the post-1947 Cantonese nationalist Clique in the mainland China region and the KMT being completely politically annihilated by this. The Japanese use this opportunity to quietly annex the restored Korean People's Republic and the Republic of Formosa, with the surviving anti-Japanese elements of the pre-1910 and post-1947 Korean political, military and aristocratic elite being covertly encouraged to move to the Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China along with pro-China reunificationists on Taiwan. The brief resumption of the Chinese Civil War upends the balance of power in Indochina due to the KMT providing support to anti-Maoist and anti-communist forces in the region. The Communist Party of Vietnam-ruled Socialist Republic of Vietnam falls due to KMT, US and CCP remnant secret support of Vietnamese Nationalist Party rebels, but the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled continuation/modernization/Government in exile of the Great Ming State, the Empire of Vietnam returns to power in Vietnam, the Lao People Revolutionary Party-ruled Lao Democratic People's Republic occupying Laos also collapses and the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos returns to power in Laos and the House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia regains power in Cambodia after the CCP and US-backed Khmer Rouge terrrorists in Cambodia collapse, although the restored Empire of Vietnam quickly absorbs the restored Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia into itself [the restored Empire of Vietnam]. Due to both the Americans and Soviets being occupied with the China region the CIA and Anglophile elements of the former KGB never collaborated to launch the Islamic Revolution in Iran and thus the Iranian Imperial House of Pahlavi-ruled Imperial State of Iran remains the government of Iran. When the Soviets retreat from Afghanistan the Iranians move in and quickly absorb Afghanistan into Iran, deliberately pushing the Taliban into Soviet-occupied Central Asia where both the Soviets and KGB waste untold amounts of time and money in endless forever wars against both the Taliban and the jihadists returning from the China region, while the restored Tang dynasty and the Imperial State of Iran renew Islamo-Chinese and Iranian ties. Remnants of the PRC and CCP set up a government in exile in the USA and Remnants of the KMT-ruled Nationalist Chinese government do the same, with similar events occurring for the now long defunct ROK and DPRK, but Soviet and US soldiers and intelligence agents returning home bring back horror stories of the immense atrocities committed by the KMT and CCP against each other [the KMT and CCP] during the resumption of the Chinese Civil War as well as evidence of US and Soviet guilt in starting the Second Sino Japanese War and Soviet espionage against Japan before WW2 primarily through NKVD agent Richard Sorge leading to Pearl Harbor as a result of the provocatory Hull Note to Japan being [the Hull Note] written by Soviet sleeper cell within the US government Harry Dexter White being [the role of Stalin in starting the Second Sino Japanese War] hidden [the role of Stalin in starting the Second Sino Japanese War] by US and Soviet political and military elites is enough to bring down the US Carter administration and keep Ronald Reagan in power until the early 1990s and cause monarchist and Nationalist sentiment to soar in the USSR. When the Berlin Wall falls in 1989, the Soviet Union and by extension, the Warsaw Pact falls with it. Germany regains all the Prussian territories taken from it [Germany] by Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviets after WW2 along with the Sudetenland after the absorption of the now-dissolved Soviet puppet state of the German Democratic Republic occupying East Germany into the pro-Western Federal Republic of Germany in West Germany, and the Soviets, Poles and Czechs have to pay reparations to Germany for post-WW2 war crimes committed by Soviets and Poles against Germans. Due to a loophole in the \\"2+2 Treaty\\", the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated, pre-1919 German Empire is [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] restored [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] as the government [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] of this newly reunited Germany and [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] takes back Alsace Lorraine from France and Eupen Malmady from Belgium in a series of negotiations, fully unifying Germany for the first time since 1919. The repatriations take a toll on the Russian and Polish economies however and Poland, covertly backed by Russia, attempts to attack both Germany and Austria during the start of the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s which fails, due to the Pan Slavist nature of the revanchist Soviet and Polish governments being seen as a form of Slavic Orthodox and Catholic Nazism by the world public, the strength of the restored Imperial German Army and the heroic efforts of Catholic Croatian and Slovenian, Orthodox Macedonian and Montenegrin and Muslim Bosnian resistance fighters fighting against the Serbian supremacist government of post Soviet Yugoslavia, and the most damaging of all: the discovery and subsequent revalations of secret archives in Poland, Russia and Serbia by dissidents that showed that Russia, through the Serbian Black Hand, and the UK through the KKK in the United States had started WW1, Poland had started WW2 as a means of getting revenge on both Russia and Germany, and Josef Stalin had created Isreal as a Soviet colony after the exile of the KMT-ruled Nationalist China to Taiwan as a means of causing chaos in the Middle East and getting a foothold in the Middle East. These revelations kill the joint Soviet-Serbian-Polish war effort and both Poland and Serbia are [Poland and Serbia] occupied [Poland and Serbia] by NATO in the aftermath of the war. Massive monarchist sentiment in Central Europe and the Balkans leads to the restoration of the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling over Austria, Italian South Tyrol, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Hungary, Transylvania, the Romanian and Serbian Banat region, Czechia, Slovakia, the Polish and Ukrainian Galicia region and Carpathian Ruthenia as the government [Austria-Hungary's] of its [Austria-Hungary's] former territories. As per the ruling of the Hague and the UN, the federalist plan of the murdered Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the United States of Greater Austria is [Franz Ferdinand's United States of Greater Austria plan] implemented into both the governance and administration of the restored Austria-Hungary, which [the restored Austria-Hungary] consists of [the Central Europe and Balkan states that make up the restored Austria-Hungary] a restored Hapsburg-ruled pre Nazi Federal State of Austria in Austria, Tyrol and Slovenia, a restored pre-1947 Italian royal family House of Savoy-ruled Independent State of Croatia in Croatia and Greater Bosnia, a restored Kingdom of Hungary in Hungary, Banat and Transylvania, the German House of Luxembourg-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia in the former Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Galicia in Galicia. The restored Austria-Hungary then restores the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the pre-1974 German House of Glücksburg-ruled Kingdom of Greece in Greece minus Thrace, which [Thrace] is [Thrace] given to Bulgaria along with Macedonia after a coup restores the Catholic side branch of the original German royal house of the current British imperial family, the German House of of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the German-Hungarian House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry-ruled Tsardom of Bulgaria to power in post Soviet Bulgaria. The pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy is [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] also [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] restored [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] as the government [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] of Italy with elements taken from fascist Italy under Mussolini and Italy regains Libya as a restored Italian North Africa, and Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Somaliland as a restored Italian Africa, although the Bourbons become the Italian royal family instead of the Savoys, who [the Savoys] are instead the monarchs [the Savoys] of the restored African sub kingdoms [the restored Italian North Africa and the restored Italian East Africa] inside the Kingdom of Italy. This restored Kingdom of Italy is in effect an Austrian satellite state. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restored German Empire] restoring the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper through the reenforcement of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The 1991 coup by hardline elements of the Soviet combined land, air and sea combat forces, the Soviet Armed Forces in the post-Soviet successor state of the oligarch and KGB-controlled Russian Federation is greeted by an combined invasion of Russia and Mongolia by NATO, the Imperial State of Iran, the Mongolian Autonomous Federation and Japan which results in the fall of both the Russian Federation and Japan. Japan restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast while [Japan] restoring the Bogd Khan-ruled Bogd Khanate of Mongolia in Outer Mongolia and the various greater Mongolian territories taken by both the Romanov Czars of Russia and the Soviets over the years and the parts of Inner Mongolia unclaimed by the restored Mengjiang, [Japan] also restoring the Kingdom of Tannu Uriankhai in the Russian Tuva Republic. The restored German Empire restores the Novgorod Republic in Northern Russia and the restored Austria-Hungary restores the German-Danish-Russian Imperial House of Romanov-ruled pre-1917 Russian Empire in European Russia. The Kingdom of Jordan also annexes Isreal, Palestine and Lebanon and the short-lived Arab Royal House of Hashim-ruled Kingdom of Syria is also restored in Syria, [the restored Kingdom of Syria] annexing Jordan to form a Levantine Federation. The Hashemites are also restored to power in Iraq after the mysterious death of Saddam Hussein via a Soviet spy ring in the now-defunct Israeli Mossad. Iran retakes Azerbaijan and Dagestan along with Uzbekistan, Tajikstan and Turkmenistan to form Greater Iran As the 20th century comes to an end, the world is divided into multiple power blocs, NATO, which [NATO] has [NATO] become a modern-day version of the WW1-era Central Powers and the EU, which [the EU] is the Germanic Mittlemache [Middle Europe] WW1 era European community in all but name ruling over Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals in the name of liberal constitutional monarchy, the Arab League consisting of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the restored Kingdom of Syria and the restored Kingdom of Iraq which [the Arab League] dominates the Arab world and the Islamic community, the British Commonwealth which has returned to being the British Empire in all but name, having taken the Southern US away from the USA in the form a restored Democrat Party-ruled Confederacy, the Vietnamese, Indonesian and Malay-dominated ASEAN which effectively controls South East Asia and [ASEAN] has the restored Kingdom of Tibet and a restored House of Kawānanakoa-ruled Kingdom of Hawaii in a post-US occcupation Hawaii as member states and the Association of East Asia, consisting of Japan, the restored Empire of China, the restored Tang Empire, the restored Far Eastern Republic, the restored Mongolian Autonomous Federation, the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia, the restored Kumul Khanate, the Pacific States of America consisting of the US states on the USA's West Coast and the restored Kingdom of Tannu Uriankhai By the start of the 21th century, the world is very different from what it was during the Cold War, with the USA being reduced to a third rate power relying on selling arms to any third-world banana republic with enough money to pay for said arms.

Beyond its walls, a world of clandestine combat and hidden truths thrived, unbeknownst to most who dwelled within. Tonight, however, the cozy domestic existence of the Araragi family converged with the shadowy dealings of the Mugen Tenshin clan as two of their most skilled—Karen and Tsukihi—embarked on a critical mission. With unparalleled stealth, Kasumi and Ayane, known to their family as Karen and Tsukihi respectively, glided into the Araragi household. Their mission to investigate the clandestine Umbrella base in the USA had revealed harrowing truths. It was time to shed their kunoichi guises, at least momentarily. Both carried the weight of knowledge that Victor Donovan, DOATEC's manipulative overlord, collaborated with Umbrella to forge an ultimate fighter, a weapon that could destabilize the fragile balance of power in a shadow-war-ridden world. As they neared their respective bedrooms, the reminder of their other lives as sisters Karen and Tsukihi lingered close. They slipped out of their tactical suits, ready to don the everyday clothes that marked their temporary return to normalcy. Just a few more steps, and they would emerge from their chameleonic transformation to immerse themselves in the upcoming DOA tournament—this time as fighters seeking to unearth more about Donovan's grand design. However, fate had other plans. Koyumi, ever the nocturnal philosopher, craved a midnight snack and much to his surprise, caught sight of a familiar silhouette dancing along the walls of the corridor. He followed the ephemeral shape, his curiosity morphing into concern. Pushing the door ajar, Koyumi's gaze locked onto the scene before him—his sisters, half in the shadow, their lean and honed bodies momentarily exposed as they switched from their lethal attire to the garments of their everyday lives. Karen, with movements characteristic of the martial arts prodigy she was, slipped into a casual tee and shorts, a far cry from the skin-tight suit that whispered of her ninja lineage. Tsukihi, mirroring the calm of her disciplined spirit, folded her kunoichi uniform with a reverence only those truly initiated could appreciate. Too late to hide; Koyumi's presence filled the room—an unwavering beacon in the depths of secrets and lives lived in parallel. The revelation was stark, but the unspoken understanding hung in the air, suffused with the respect befitting martial artists and kin alike. It was a crossroads, where covert lives met the unsuspecting routines of daylight. Koyumi was no stranger to the abstruse world they navigated—he was, after all, a quiet genius with his fair share of encounters with the extraordinary. Koyumi cleared his throat, the subtle sound enough to pause the time-held rhythm of dressing. \\"Karen, Tsukihi...\\" he began, an undercurrent of warmth tempering the surprise in his voice. \\"Is there a reason my sisters returned home in the small hours, dressed like characters from a thriller novel?\\" Karen smiled, her visage a complex tapestry of relief and affection. Tsukihi met his eyes, her expression steeled yet softened around the edges with an emotion that tread between fear and gratitude for the familiarity of their brother. \\"We have things to discuss,\\" Karen said, the gravity of her words belying her seemingly carefree demeanor. The air shifted, the walls of the Araragi home baring witness to secrets ready to spill forth, painting a narrative that would forever alter the fabric of their world. Their tale was to be one of espionage and kinship, sword edged with duty, in the Shadow Veil: A Tacticus Cross Epoch."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

Translate to English","output":"It seems like you have provided a text in Hindi that appears to be a transcript of a motivational or self-help video about Japanese techniques to overcome laziness and increase productivity. Let me translate the essence of the text to English for you: --- \\"No person is inherently lazy; they may either be ill or uninspired. If you, too, want to do much but find your laziness destroying your plans, then you need to know these six Japanese techniques that prevent laziness and help in staying active and hardworking. But before we get into that, it’s important to understand that the people living in Japan have unbeatable discipline, punctuality, and work ethics that you may not find in many other countries. Despite Japan facing devastation from two nuclear bombs and regularly facing natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis, and being rebuilt three to four times, Japan is still one of the superpowers of the world. But how? The secret is hidden in the Japanese culture, i.e., six techniques that the Japanese follow to prevent laziness and stay active, among which the fourth technique is crucial, so don’t skip it. The first technique is 'Seiri, Seiton, Seiso,' a method of creating a clean and productive environment. It is a step-by-step method to make your workspace or environment productive. Using this 3S technique means following three steps: Seiri means sorting and removing unnecessary items from your environment, Seiton means setting things in order and organizing items that you do need, and Seiso means shining or cleaning the space to ensure there’s no dirt left. The second technique is 'Kaizen,' which involves making small, gradual changes to improve and doesn’t require you to have a lot of energy. By practicing Kaizen, you commit to performing a task for just one minute, reducing the burden and breaking the myth of laziness in your mind. The third technique is 'The Rule of Three,' which helps in keeping you focused on your most important tasks and not getting distracted by trivial things. The fourth technique is 'Kai kaku.' This term means radical change; it suggests making changes quickly and focusing on significant improvements rather than small steps. The fifth principle is 'Hara Hachi Bu,' which means eating mindfully. It is important not just what you eat, but also how you eat. You should never fill your stomach more than 80%, as overeating requires more energy for digestion and makes you feel more lethargic. The sixth technique is 'Zen of Mindfulness.' You can implement all these techniques successfully only when you learn to be mindful. This means completely surrendering to the present moment without regrets about the past or worries about the future.

Here's how you can do it in JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript // Define the main string let mainString = 'Accel ID = XXXAccel ID = TEST2'; // Define the regular expression pattern to match 'Accel ID = ' followed by any text until 'Accel ID = ' is found again let pattern = /(Accel ID = ).*(Accel ID = )/; // Replace the matched pattern with just 'XXXAccel ID = ' let resultString = mainString.replace(pattern, '2'); console.log(resultString); // Output should be 'Accel ID = TEST2' \`\`\` In the \`pattern\`, the regular expression \`(Accel ID = ).*(Accel ID = )\` matches: - \`(Accel ID = )\`: matches the literal string 'Accel ID = ' and captures it as group 1 - \`.*\`: matches any character (except for line terminators) between the two 'Accel ID = ' patterns - \`(Accel ID = )\`: matches the second occurrence of the literal string 'Accel ID = ' and captures it as group 2 In the \`replace\` method, \`2\` refers to the second captured group (i.e., the second 'Accel ID = ').

Please note that JavaScript's \`.replace()\` function replaces only the first occurrence by default. If you want to replace all occurrences, you would use a global flag (\`/g\`) in your regular expression.

Before the events of the excerpt started, the death of Chiang Kai Shek in 1975 and Mao Zedong in 1976 lead to a power struggle within both the Chinese nationalists, Han supremacist, Han nationalist Chinese Communist Party-ruled People's Republic of China ruling over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Manchuria and Shanxi since 1949, which [the PRC] Mao had [the PRC] ruled as both its [the PRC's] first and founding fascist dictator [Mao] from 1949 until his [Mao's] death and the Han nationalist, Han supremacist Leninist Stalinist Kuomingtang-ruled Nationalist China/Second Republic of China which [Nationalist China] Chiang had ruled as Generalissmo [Chiang] from 1928 and even during the period of its [Nationalist China's] exile in 1949 on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands after [Nationalist China] losing the Chinese Civil War to the CCP and what would become the PRC as Mao's chosen successor Hua Guofeng battled the post 1947, pro Soviet, pro American and pro KMT and pro Nationalist China Cantonese nationalist Clique in mainland China headed by Deng Xiaoping, which lead to East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and even Yunnan breaking away from the PRC along with Manchuria, leaving the PRC in charge of Han China alone. The Cantonese nationalist Clique in mainland China headed by Xiaoping joins forces with the KMT-lead Nationalist China in exile and launches a rebellion in Guangxi and Guangdong, although the Nationalist Chinese government in exile is forced to flee to and set up shop in the Cantonia region due to native indigenous Taiwanese resistance against the KMT rule in Taiwan, restarting the Chinese Civil War between the KMT-dominated Nationalists and the CCP-ruled PRC once more. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-rules Kumul Khanate is [the Kumul Khanate] restored [the Kumul Khanate] as the government of post-PRC East Turkestan due to a mass jihad being declared against both the CCP and the USSR helping the native Turkic Uyghur people of East Turkestan stave off Soviet invasion and occupation. In post CCP Tibet, the theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is restored as the government of the country. Central China, more specifically the area ruled by the Hui Muslim warlord family of the Mas as Xibei San Ma during the modern Chinese warlord era, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War also breaks free from Han China, [the former Xibei San Ma] restoring the Turko-Mongol Han Chinese Imperial House of Li-ruled Great Tang Empire/Tang dynasty to power as an Islamic sultanate in the model of the Arab Islamic monarchies, the Ottoman Empire and the pre Russian Empire Mongol Empire successor states in Central Asia. Facing pressure from the world due to the Vietnam War and not wanting another regional confrontation, the Americans convince the Soviets to drop all support for the KMT-lead Nationalist China in exile and also to jointly return Taiwan and the Pengu Islands to Japan in a repeat of the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. Fearing that pro-democracy protests in the joint US-PRC puppet state of the military dictatorship of the Republic of Korea occupying South Korea and the Soviet satellite state of the Worker's Party of Korea-ruled Democratic People's Republic of Korea occupying North Korea and from there spread to the USSR, thus affecting the stability of the Soviet Union, Soviet leaders also pressure the Americans to return all of the Korean peninsula to Japan with US and Soviet troops withdrawing from both the former DPRK and ROK in exchange for nonaggression treaties and an unofficial acknowledgment of the USA and USSR both starting the Second Sino Japanese War by backing Chiang Kai Shek against Japan during the Second Sino Japanese War. The Soviets also return Sahlakin and the Kurils to Japan. After the return of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, the Korean peninsula, Sahalkin and the Kurils to Japan, the Japanese restore the post-1947, pre-DPRK, pre-ROK People's Republic of Korea founded [the PRK] by Korean independence activist Lyuh Woon-hyung in 1947 before its [the PRK's] subsequent invasion by both the USSR and USA, [the Japanese restoring the PRK] as the government [the PRK] of a united, post-DPRK, post-ROK Korean peninsula with opposition pro-democracy politicians from both the now dissolved DPRK and ROK serving in the restored PRK's government. The Japanese also establish the Republic of Formosa on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, with former Imperial Japanese Army solider turned pro-democracy politician Lee Teng Hui serving as the Republic of Formosa's first president. Japan also restores its [Japan's] pre-WW2 era protectorates of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria and the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions, to the delight of the Manchus/Manchurians and Mongolians with Han Chinese settler colonists placed in these nations [Manchuria and Inner Mongolia] by the CCP during the PRC's rule fleeing to the PRC-ruled Han China. The millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on Militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society continues to grow in strength and [the Yellow Sand Society] increase membership and support and [the Yellow Sand Society] overthrown the PRC in 1980 with the help of compromised elements of the CCP, the PRC's combined land, sea and air combat forces, the People's Liberation Army, the combined protection service for the elite section of the CCP, domestic secret plice agency and border control division of the PRC, the Ministry of State Security, the paramilitary organization of the PRC's government primarily responsible for internal security, riot control, counter-terrorism, disaster response, law enforcement and maritime rights protection, the Chinese People's Armed Police, along with the Triads, who [the Triads] have [the Triads] switched from the KMT and Nationalist China to the Yellow Sand Society due to their [the Triads'] initial formation as a means to restore the Great Ming State to power in China. The CCP is [the CCP] reabsorbed into its [the CCP's] parent political organization, the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han fascist Conservative political organisation adhering to Dr Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people (or welfarism), the Young China Party [YCP], which [the YCP] was [the YCP] named after the infamous Young Turks in the now long dissolved Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Ottoman Empire, [the YCP] having followed the KMT and the ROC into exile on Taiwan in 1949 but [the YCP] returning to Han China after the PRC's overthrow by request of moderates within the PRC, [the CCP's remerger with the YCP] becoming [the CCP as part of the YCP once more] the YCP's ultra-nationalist left-wing [the CCP as part of the YCP once more] again as the YCP becomes the governing political organization [the YCP] of post-PRC Han China ruled by the Yellow Sand Society. The Yellow Sand Society is forced to compromise with the YCP, [the Yellow Sand Society] restoring the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China in the form of a restored Yuan Shikai-founded Empire of China as an Islamic sultanate under Sharia Law with the surviving descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu being reenthroned as the Chinese Imperial family in the place of Yuan Shikai's descendants, who are absorbed into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu. This restored Empire of China ruled by the Zhu instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants and is still officially referred to in English as the People's Republic of China but is referred to as the Empire of China or the Empire of the Great Ming in traditional Chinese. It flies the Beiyang Government's five-color flag with a golden-rayed, red sun version of the Nationalist China white sun emblem in the middle, uses the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China's and the initial Empire of China's twelve symbols national emblem as its national emblem, uses the Wuchang Uprising flag as its Army flag and a version of Nationalist China's iconic Bue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag with a yellow sun, red Inner rays and white outer rays as a tribute to the original Ming trade flag, a blue banner with a yellow sun with red rays. Yuan Shikai's descendants are absorbed into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu via concubine, polygamy and adoption. This restored Empire of China is a provisional authoritarian absolute Imperial unitary monarchy under military dictatorship from 1981-1985, and then a constitutional parliamentary democratic absolute federalist unitary Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections from 1986 onwards, being known as the Empire of China in both traditional Chinese and English onwards as well. The Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China has an informal tributary status with Japan akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China's final incarnation as the WW2 era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China under Sun Yat Sen's protégé and rightful heir, Wang Jingwei. Sun Yat Sen is still honored as the father of the nation and his three principles of the people play a key role in the government of the nation, but its real founders are considered to be Shikai, Jingwei and controversially Mao. Nationalist China manages to push deeper north into China and hold on to the territory, but Cantonese independence activist and pro-democracy rebels infiltrate its ranks and transform it into an independent Cantonese Republic in all but name. Nationalist China then joins SEATO and [Nationalist China] signs a peace Treaty with the Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China, the post-PRC restored Manchukuo in the post-PRC independent Manchuria and Mongolian Autonomous Federation, the post-PRC restored Kingdom of Tibet in post-PRC independent Tibet, the post-PRC restored Kumul Khanate in post-PRC East Turkestan and Japan that officially ends the Chinese Civil War and confirms the status of the post-PRC and Nationalist China successor states in the China region as sovereign independent states. Nationalist China then undergoes a mysterious coup that sees it become a restored Ming satellite state, rump kingdom and tributary kingdom of the Japanese-Han Chinese Zheng dynasty/Royal House of Koxinga-rules Tungning Kingdom with the remnants of the post-1947 Cantonese nationalist Clique in the mainland China region and the KMT being completely politically annihilated by this. The Japanese use this opportunity to quietly annex the restored Korean People's Republic and the Republic of Formosa, with the surviving anti-Japanese elements of the pre-1910 and post-1947 Korean political, military and aristocratic elite being covertly encouraged to move to the Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China along with pro-China reunificationists on Taiwan. The brief resumption of the Chinese Civil War upends the balance of power in Indochina due to the KMT providing support to anti-Maoist and anti-communist forces in the region. The Communist Party of Vietnam-ruled Socialist Republic of Vietnam falls due to KMT, US and CCP remnant secret support of Vietnamese Nationalist Party rebels, but the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled continuation/modernization/Government in exile of the Great Ming State, the Empire of Vietnam returns to power in Vietnam, the Lao People Revolutionary Party-ruled Lao Democratic People's Republic occupying Laos also collapses and the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos returns to power in Laos and the House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia regains power in Cambodia after the CCP and US-backed Khmer Rouge terrrorists in Cambodia collapse, although the restored Empire of Vietnam quickly absorbs the restored Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia into itself [the restored Empire of Vietnam]. Due to both the Americans and Soviets being occupied with the China region the CIA and Anglophile elements of the former KGB never collaborated to launch the Islamic Revolution in Iran and thus the Iranian Imperial House of Pahlavi-ruled Imperial State of Iran remains the government of Iran. When the Soviets retreat from Afghanistan the Iranians move in and quickly absorb Afghanistan into Iran, deliberately pushing the Taliban into Soviet-occupied Central Asia where both the Soviets and KGB waste untold amounts of time and money in endless forever wars against both the Taliban and the jihadists returning from the China region, while the restored Tang dynasty and the Imperial State of Iran renew Islamo-Chinese and Iranian ties. Remnants of the PRC and CCP set up a government in exile in the USA and Remnants of the KMT-ruled Nationalist Chinese government do the same, with similar events occurring for the now long defunct ROK and DPRK, but Soviet and US soldiers and intelligence agents returning home bring back horror stories of the immense atrocities committed by the KMT and CCP against each other [the KMT and CCP] during the resumption of the Chinese Civil War as well as evidence of US and Soviet guilt in starting the Second Sino Japanese War and Soviet espionage against Japan before WW2 primarily through NKVD agent Richard Sorge leading to Pearl Harbor as a result of the provocatory Hull Note to Japan being [the Hull Note] written by Soviet sleeper cell within the US government Harry Dexter White being [the role of Stalin in starting the Second Sino Japanese War] hidden [the role of Stalin in starting the Second Sino Japanese War] by US and Soviet political and military elites is enough to bring down the US Carter administration and keep Ronald Reagan in power until the early 1990s and cause monarchist and Nationalist sentiment to soar in the USSR. When the Berlin Wall falls in 1989, the Soviet Union and by extension, the Warsaw Pact falls with it. Germany regains all the Prussian territories taken from it [Germany] by Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviets after WW2 along with the Sudetenland after the absorption of the now-dissolved Soviet puppet state of the German Democratic Republic occupying East Germany into the pro-Western Federal Republic of Germany in West Germany, and the Soviets, Poles and Czechs have to pay reparations to Germany for post-WW2 war crimes committed by Soviets and Poles against Germans. Due to a loophole in the \\"2+2 Treaty\\", the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated, pre-1919 German Empire is [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] restored [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] as the government [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] of this newly reunited Germany and [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] takes back Alsace Lorraine from France and Eupen Malmady from Belgium in a series of negotiations, fully unifying Germany for the first time since 1919. The repatriations take a toll on the Russian and Polish economies however and Poland, covertly backed by Russia, attempts to attack both Germany and Austria during the start of the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s which fails, due to the Pan Slavist nature of the revanchist Soviet and Polish governments being seen as a form of Slavic Orthodox and Catholic Nazism by the world public, the strength of the restored Imperial German Army and the heroic efforts of Catholic Croatian and Slovenian, Orthodox Macedonian and Montenegrin and Muslim Bosnian resistance fighters fighting against the Serbian supremacist government of post Soviet Yugoslavia, and the most damaging of all: the discovery and subsequent revalations of secret archives in Poland, Russia and Serbia by dissidents that showed that Russia, through the Serbian Black Hand, and the UK through the KKK in the United States had started WW1, Poland had started WW2 as a means of getting revenge on both Russia and Germany, and Josef Stalin had created Isreal as a Soviet colony after the exile of the KMT-ruled Nationalist China to Taiwan as a means of causing chaos in the Middle East and getting a foothold in the Middle East. These revelations kill the joint Soviet-Serbian-Polish war effort and both Poland and Serbia are [Poland and Serbia] occupied [Poland and Serbia] by NATO in the aftermath of the war. Massive monarchist sentiment in Central Europe and the Balkans leads to the restoration of the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling over Austria, Italian South Tyrol, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Hungary, Transylvania, the Romanian and Serbian Banat region, Czechia, Slovakia, the Polish and Ukrainian Galicia region and Carpathian Ruthenia as the government [Austria-Hungary's] of its [Austria-Hungary's] former territories. As per the ruling of the Hague and the UN, the federalist plan of the murdered Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the United States of Greater Austria is [Franz Ferdinand's United States of Greater Austria plan] implemented into both the governance and administration of the restored Austria-Hungary, which [the restored Austria-Hungary] consists of [the Central Europe and Balkan states that make up the restored Austria-Hungary] a restored Hapsburg-ruled pre Nazi Federal State of Austria in Austria, Tyrol and Slovenia, a restored pre-1947 Italian royal family House of Savoy-ruled Independent State of Croatia in Croatia and Greater Bosnia, a restored Kingdom of Hungary in Hungary, Banat and Transylvania, the German House of Luxembourg-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia in the former Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Galicia in Galicia. The restored Austria-Hungary then restores the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the pre-1974 German House of Glücksburg-ruled Kingdom of Greece in Greece minus Thrace, which [Thrace] is [Thrace] given to Bulgaria along with Macedonia after a coup restores the Catholic side branch of the original German royal house of the current British imperial family, the German House of of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the German-Hungarian House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry-ruled Tsardom of Bulgaria to power in post Soviet Bulgaria. The pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy is [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] also [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] restored [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] as the government [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] of Italy with elements taken from fascist Italy under Mussolini and Italy regains Libya as a restored Italian North Africa, and Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Somaliland as a restored Italian Africa, although the Bourbons become the Italian royal family instead of the Savoys, who [the Savoys] are instead the monarchs [the Savoys] of the restored African sub kingdoms [the restored Italian North Africa and the restored Italian East Africa] inside the Kingdom of Italy. This restored Kingdom of Italy is in effect an Austrian satellite state. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restored German Empire] restoring the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper through the reenforcement of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The 1991 coup by hardline elements of the Soviet combined land, air and sea combat forces, the Soviet Armed Forces in the post-Soviet successor state of the oligarch and KGB-controlled Russian Federation is greeted by an combined invasion of Russia and Mongolia by NATO, the Imperial State of Iran, the Mongolian Autonomous Federation and Japan which results in the fall of both the Russian Federation and Japan.

Iran retakes Azerbaijan and Dagestan along with Uzbekistan, Tajikstan and Turkmenistan to form Greater Iran As the 20th century comes to an end, the world is divided into multiple power blocs, NATO, which [NATO] has [NATO] become a modern-day version of the WW1-era Central Powers and the EU, which [the EU] is the Germanic Mittlemache [Middle Europe] WW1 era European community in all but name ruling over Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals in the name of liberal constitutional monarchy, the Arab League consisting of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the restored Kingdom of Syria and the restored Kingdom of Iraq which [the Arab League] dominates the Arab world and the Islamic community, the British Commonwealth which has returned to being the British Empire in all but name, having taken the Southern US away from the USA in the form a restored Democrat Party-ruled Confederacy, the Vietnamese, Indonesian and Malay-dominated ASEAN which effectively controls South East Asia and [ASEAN] has the restored Kingdom of Tibet and a restored House of Kawānanakoa-ruled Kingdom of Hawaii in a post-US occcupation Hawaii as member states and the Association of East Asia, consisting of Japan, the restored Empire of China, the restored Tang Empire, the restored Far Eastern Republic, the restored Mongolian Autonomous Federation, the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia, the restored Kumul Khanate, the Pacific States of America consisting of the US states on the USA's West Coast and the restored Kingdom of Tannu Uriankhai By the start of the 21th century, the world is very different from what it was during the Cold War, with the USA being reduced to a third rate power relying on selling arms to any third-world banana republic with enough money to pay for said arms.

Please Note: The events of this chapter except occur within a single universe and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here. Everything occurs in chronological order and within the same timeline.","output":"Under the cloak of darkness, the quiet suburb where the Araragi mansion stood, usually a bastion of tranquility, was tonight the silent witness to a surreptitious stir. Kasumi and Ayane, or as they were truly known, Karen Araragi and Tsukihi Araragi, crept closer to the familiar structure that was their familial home. They moved with the trained precision only those deeply ingrained in the arts of the Mugen Tenshin ninja clan could muster. Their hearts beat in an uncomfortable sync, not from the fear of getting caught—they had faced far worse dangers in their lives—but from the strangeness of sneaking into their own home, making even the most mundane of objects cast ominous shadows in their eyes. Dressed in skintight bodysuits that embraced their forms with the promise of protection and concealment, the two sisters were indistinguishable from the lethal kunoichi they truly were. The resilience and technology of their garbs spoke of an era where mystical oni bloodlines intersected with the bleeding edge of military advances. They slipped through the window, pausing only to ensure their entry went unnoticed. Inside the austere, yet somehow comforting confines of the Araragi mansion, the juxtaposition of their martial attires against the casual homeliness was stark. The two sisters shared an unspoken consensus; the time to transition back to Karen and Tsukihi had come. Yet, as they parted ways towards their individual sanctums to shed their warrior exteriors, a ripple of anxiety met them both. Infiltrating this year's DOA tournament wasn't just another mission—it was a calculated gambit with stakes that seemed to climb with each whispered conspiracy about Victor Donovan and his insidious partnership with the Umbrella Corporation. They harbored no illusions; the tournament was a front, a marketplace for showcasing the pawns of tomorrow's wars. And yet, even within the solemnity of their determined march, the faint but persistent buzz of excitement ran through their veins. They were not just ninjas; they were protectors of realms seen and unseen, caught in the intricate dance of espionage, intrigue, and familial ties. Karen, swiftly moving to her room, unzipped her bodysuit, her skin a stark contrast against the dark material. Tsukihi, mirroring her twin's actions, did the same, her movements a ballet of honed skill and urgency. They both knew their Arahagi brother, Koyumi, diffident in his mannerisms yet formidable in intellect, had been deeply engrossed in his academic pursuits—too much, perhaps, to notice the difference. Yet, as both sisters transitioned, unbeknownst to them, Koyumi's pursuit of a late-night snack became an unforeseen interception. He stumbled upon his younger sisters, the transformation unfolding before his eyes not entirely a shock but rather the confirmation of a suspicion long-buried beneath layers of domestic normality. There stood Koyumi, his gaze locked with Karen and Tsukihi. The ephemeral veil of secrecy, carefully maintained for years, fluttered down silently like a leaf to the ground. Their worlds, once orbiting in tandem yet never crossing, collided in the hushed luminescence of the moonlight streaming through the window. Fates realigned, allegiances reaffirmed, and the hidden truth now lay bare before them. Unraveling would come later. The imminent threat, the tournament, and the sinewy tendrils of war reaching ever closer necessitated unity. And with the weight of impending confrontation heavy in the air, the silence was broken by Koyumi, his voice firm yet tinged with the warmth of kinship. \\"Karen... Tsukihi... what happens now?\\" Now, they would answer not as Kasumi and Ayane, but as the sisters they truly were—bound by blood, duty, and the unbreakable ties of an unusual but undeniably powerful family. For in this twisted tapestry of conflicts, monsters, espionage, and adventure, one truth remains steadfast; in unity, there is strength. And tonight, the Araragi family would need all the strength they could muster."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Javelin: “So, Laffey, there’s something I’m curious about…” Laffey: “What is it, Javelin?” Javelin: “Well, I’ve noticed that you always seem so…laid back.

Before the events of the excerpt started, the death of Chiang Kai Shek in 1975 and Mao Zedong in 1976 lead to a power struggle within both the Chinese nationalists, Han supremacist, Han nationalist Chinese Communist Party-ruled People's Republic of China ruling over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Manchuria and Shanxi since 1949, which [the PRC] Mao had [the PRC] ruled as both its [the PRC's] first and founding fascist dictator [Mao] from 1949 until his [Mao's] death and the Han nationalist, Han supremacist Leninist Stalinist Kuomingtang-ruled Nationalist China/Second Republic of China which [Nationalist China] Chiang had ruled as Generalissmo [Chiang] from 1928 and even during the period of its [Nationalist China's] exile in 1949 on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands after [Nationalist China] losing the Chinese Civil War to the CCP and what would become the PRC as Mao's chosen successor Hua Guofeng battled the post 1947, pro Soviet, pro American and pro KMT and pro Nationalist China Cantonese nationalist Clique in mainland China headed by Deng Xiaoping, which lead to East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and even Yunnan breaking away from the PRC along with Manchuria, leaving the PRC in charge of Han China alone. The Cantonese nationalist Clique in mainland China headed by Xiaoping joins forces with the KMT-lead Nationalist China in exile and launches a rebellion in Guangxi and Guangdong, although the Nationalist Chinese government in exile is forced to flee to and set up shop in the Cantonia region due to native indigenous Taiwanese resistance against the KMT rule in Taiwan, restarting the Chinese Civil War between the KMT-dominated Nationalists and the CCP-ruled PRC once more. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-rules Kumul Khanate is [the Kumul Khanate] restored [the Kumul Khanate] as the government of post-PRC East Turkestan due to a mass jihad being declared against both the CCP and the USSR helping the native Turkic Uyghur people of East Turkestan stave off Soviet invasion and occupation. In post CCP Tibet, the theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is restored as the government of the country. Central China, more specifically the area ruled by the Hui Muslim warlord family of the Mas as Xibei San Ma during the modern Chinese warlord era, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War also breaks free from Han China, [the former Xibei San Ma] restoring the Turko-Mongol Han Chinese Imperial House of Li-ruled Great Tang Empire/Tang dynasty to power as an Islamic sultanate in the model of the Arab Islamic monarchies, the Ottoman Empire and the pre Russian Empire Mongol Empire successor states in Central Asia. Facing pressure from the world due to the Vietnam War and not wanting another regional confrontation, the Americans convince the Soviets to drop all support for the KMT-lead Nationalist China in exile and also to jointly return Taiwan and the Pengu Islands to Japan in a repeat of the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. Fearing that pro-democracy protests in the joint US-PRC puppet state of the military dictatorship of the Republic of Korea occupying South Korea and the Soviet satellite state of the Worker's Party of Korea-ruled Democratic People's Republic of Korea occupying North Korea and from there spread to the USSR, thus affecting the stability of the Soviet Union, Soviet leaders also pressure the Americans to return all of the Korean peninsula to Japan with US and Soviet troops withdrawing from both the former DPRK and ROK in exchange for nonaggression treaties and an unofficial acknowledgment of the USA and USSR both starting the Second Sino Japanese War by backing Chiang Kai Shek against Japan during the Second Sino Japanese War. The Soviets also return Sahlakin and the Kurils to Japan. After the return of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, the Korean peninsula, Sahalkin and the Kurils to Japan, the Japanese restore the post-1947, pre-DPRK, pre-ROK People's Republic of Korea founded [the PRK] by Korean independence activist Lyuh Woon-hyung in 1947 before its [the PRK's] subsequent invasion by both the USSR and USA, [the Japanese restoring the PRK] as the government [the PRK] of a united, post-DPRK, post-ROK Korean peninsula with opposition pro-democracy politicians from both the now dissolved DPRK and ROK serving in the restored PRK's government. The Japanese also establish the Republic of Formosa on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, with former Imperial Japanese Army solider turned pro-democracy politician Lee Teng Hui serving as the Republic of Formosa's first president. Japan also restores its [Japan's] pre-WW2 era protectorates of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria and the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions, to the delight of the Manchus/Manchurians and Mongolians with Han Chinese settler colonists placed in these nations [Manchuria and Inner Mongolia] by the CCP during the PRC's rule fleeing to the PRC-ruled Han China. The millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on Militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society continues to grow in strength and [the Yellow Sand Society] increase membership and support and [the Yellow Sand Society] overthrown the PRC in 1980 with the help of compromised elements of the CCP, the PRC's combined land, sea and air combat forces, the People's Liberation Army, the combined protection service for the elite section of the CCP, domestic secret plice agency and border control division of the PRC, the Ministry of State Security, the paramilitary organization of the PRC's government primarily responsible for internal security, riot control, counter-terrorism, disaster response, law enforcement and maritime rights protection, the Chinese People's Armed Police, along with the Triads, who [the Triads] have [the Triads] switched from the KMT and Nationalist China to the Yellow Sand Society due to their [the Triads'] initial formation as a means to restore the Great Ming State to power in China. The CCP is [the CCP] reabsorbed into its [the CCP's] parent political organization, the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han fascist Conservative political organisation adhering to Dr Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people (or welfarism), the Young China Party [YCP], which [the YCP] was [the YCP] named after the infamous Young Turks in the now long dissolved Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Ottoman Empire, [the YCP] having followed the KMT and the ROC into exile on Taiwan in 1949 but [the YCP] returning to Han China after the PRC's overthrow by request of moderates within the PRC, [the CCP's remerger with the YCP] becoming [the CCP as part of the YCP once more] the YCP's ultra-nationalist left-wing [the CCP as part of the YCP once more] again as the YCP becomes the governing political organization [the YCP] of post-PRC Han China ruled by the Yellow Sand Society. The Yellow Sand Society is forced to compromise with the YCP, [the Yellow Sand Society] restoring the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China in the form of a restored Yuan Shikai-founded Empire of China as an Islamic sultanate under Sharia Law with the surviving descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu being reenthroned as the Chinese Imperial family in the place of Yuan Shikai's descendants, who are absorbed into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu. This restored Empire of China ruled by the Zhu instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants and is still officially referred to in English as the People's Republic of China but is referred to as the Empire of China or the Empire of the Great Ming in traditional Chinese. It flies the Beiyang Government's five-color flag with a golden-rayed, red sun version of the Nationalist China white sun emblem in the middle, uses the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China's and the initial Empire of China's twelve symbols national emblem as its national emblem, uses the Wuchang Uprising flag as its Army flag and a version of Nationalist China's iconic Bue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag with a yellow sun, red Inner rays and white outer rays as a tribute to the original Ming trade flag, a blue banner with a yellow sun with red rays. Yuan Shikai's descendants are absorbed into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu via concubine, polygamy and adoption. This restored Empire of China is a provisional authoritarian absolute Imperial unitary monarchy under military dictatorship from 1981-1985, and then a constitutional parliamentary democratic absolute federalist unitary Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections from 1986 onwards, being known as the Empire of China in both traditional Chinese and English onwards as well. The Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China has an informal tributary status with Japan akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China's final incarnation as the WW2 era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China under Sun Yat Sen's protégé and rightful heir, Wang Jingwei. Sun Yat Sen is still honored as the father of the nation and his three principles of the people play a key role in the government of the nation, but its real founders are considered to be Shikai, Jingwei and controversially Mao. Nationalist China manages to push deeper north into China and hold on to the territory, but Cantonese independence activist and pro-democracy rebels infiltrate its ranks and transform it into an independent Cantonese Republic in all but name. Nationalist China then joins SEATO and [Nationalist China] signs a peace Treaty with the Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China, the post-PRC restored Manchukuo in the post-PRC independent Manchuria and Mongolian Autonomous Federation, the post-PRC restored Kingdom of Tibet in post-PRC independent Tibet, the post-PRC restored Kumul Khanate in post-PRC East Turkestan and Japan that officially ends the Chinese Civil War and confirms the status of the post-PRC and Nationalist China successor states in the China region as sovereign independent states. Nationalist China then undergoes a mysterious coup that sees it become a restored Ming satellite state, rump kingdom and tributary kingdom of the Japanese-Han Chinese Zheng dynasty/Royal House of Koxinga-rules Tungning Kingdom with the remnants of the post-1947 Cantonese nationalist Clique in the mainland China region and the KMT being completely politically annihilated by this. The Japanese use this opportunity to quietly annex the restored Korean People's Republic and the Republic of Formosa, with the surviving anti-Japanese elements of the pre-1910 and post-1947 Korean political, military and aristocratic elite being covertly encouraged to move to the Zhu-ruled restored Empire of China along with pro-China reunificationists on Taiwan. The brief resumption of the Chinese Civil War upends the balance of power in Indochina due to the KMT providing support to anti-Maoist and anti-communist forces in the region. The Communist Party of Vietnam-ruled Socialist Republic of Vietnam falls due to KMT, US and CCP remnant secret support of Vietnamese Nationalist Party rebels, but the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled continuation/modernization/Government in exile of the Great Ming State, the Empire of Vietnam returns to power in Vietnam, the Lao People Revolutionary Party-ruled Lao Democratic People's Republic occupying Laos also collapses and the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos returns to power in Laos and the House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia regains power in Cambodia after the CCP and US-backed Khmer Rouge terrrorists in Cambodia collapse, although the restored Empire of Vietnam quickly absorbs the restored Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia into itself [the restored Empire of Vietnam]. Due to both the Americans and Soviets being occupied with the China region the CIA and Anglophile elements of the former KGB never collaborated to launch the Islamic Revolution in Iran and thus the Iranian Imperial House of Pahlavi-ruled Imperial State of Iran remains the government of Iran. When the Soviets retreat from Afghanistan the Iranians move in and quickly absorb Afghanistan into Iran, deliberately pushing the Taliban into Soviet-occupied Central Asia where both the Soviets and KGB waste untold amounts of time and money in endless forever wars against both the Taliban and the jihadists returning from the China region, while the restored Tang dynasty and the Imperial State of Iran renew Islamo-Chinese and Iranian ties. Remnants of the PRC and CCP set up a government in exile in the USA and Remnants of the KMT-ruled Nationalist Chinese government do the same, with similar events occurring for the now long defunct ROK and DPRK, but Soviet and US soldiers and intelligence agents returning home bring back horror stories of the immense atrocities committed by the KMT and CCP against each other [the KMT and CCP] during the resumption of the Chinese Civil War as well as evidence of US and Soviet guilt in starting the Second Sino Japanese War and Soviet espionage against Japan before WW2 primarily through NKVD agent Richard Sorge leading to Pearl Harbor as a result of the provocatory Hull Note to Japan being [the Hull Note] written by Soviet sleeper cell within the US government Harry Dexter White being [the role of Stalin in starting the Second Sino Japanese War] hidden [the role of Stalin in starting the Second Sino Japanese War] by US and Soviet political and military elites is enough to bring down the US Carter administration and keep Ronald Reagan in power until the early 1990s and cause monarchist and Nationalist sentiment to soar in the USSR. When the Berlin Wall falls in 1989, the Soviet Union and by extension, the Warsaw Pact falls with it. Germany regains all the Prussian territories taken from it [Germany] by Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviets after WW2 along with the Sudetenland after the absorption of the now-dissolved Soviet puppet state of the German Democratic Republic occupying East Germany into the pro-Western Federal Republic of Germany in West Germany, and the Soviets, Poles and Czechs have to pay reparations to Germany for post-WW2 war crimes committed by Soviets and Poles against Germans. Due to a loophole in the \\"2+2 Treaty\\", the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated, pre-1919 German Empire is [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] restored [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] as the government [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] of this newly reunited Germany and [the pre-1919 Hohenzollern-ruled German Empire] takes back Alsace Lorraine from France and Eupen Malmady from Belgium in a series of negotiations, fully unifying Germany for the first time since 1919. The repatriations take a toll on the Russian and Polish economies however and Poland, covertly backed by Russia, attempts to attack both Germany and Austria during the start of the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s which fails, due to the Pan Slavist nature of the revanchist Soviet and Polish governments being seen as a form of Slavic Orthodox and Catholic Nazism by the world public, the strength of the restored Imperial German Army and the heroic efforts of Catholic Croatian and Slovenian, Orthodox Macedonian and Montenegrin and Muslim Bosnian resistance fighters fighting against the Serbian supremacist government of post Soviet Yugoslavia, and the most damaging of all: the discovery and subsequent revalations of secret archives in Poland, Russia and Serbia by dissidents that showed that Russia, through the Serbian Black Hand, and the UK through the KKK in the United States had started WW1, Poland had started WW2 as a means of getting revenge on both Russia and Germany, and Josef Stalin had created Isreal as a Soviet colony after the exile of the KMT-ruled Nationalist China to Taiwan as a means of causing chaos in the Middle East and getting a foothold in the Middle East. These revelations kill the joint Soviet-Serbian-Polish war effort and both Poland and Serbia are [Poland and Serbia] occupied [Poland and Serbia] by NATO in the aftermath of the war. Massive monarchist sentiment in Central Europe and the Balkans leads to the restoration of the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling over Austria, Italian South Tyrol, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Hungary, Transylvania, the Romanian and Serbian Banat region, Czechia, Slovakia, the Polish and Ukrainian Galicia region and Carpathian Ruthenia as the government [Austria-Hungary's] of its [Austria-Hungary's] former territories. As per the ruling of the Hague and the UN, the federalist plan of the murdered Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the United States of Greater Austria is [Franz Ferdinand's United States of Greater Austria plan] implemented into both the governance and administration of the restored Austria-Hungary, which [the restored Austria-Hungary] consists of [the Central Europe and Balkan states that make up the restored Austria-Hungary] a restored Hapsburg-ruled pre Nazi Federal State of Austria in Austria, Tyrol and Slovenia, a restored pre-1947 Italian royal family House of Savoy-ruled Independent State of Croatia in Croatia and Greater Bosnia, a restored Kingdom of Hungary in Hungary, Banat and Transylvania, the German House of Luxembourg-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia in the former Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Galicia in Galicia. The restored Austria-Hungary then restores the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the pre-1974 German House of Glücksburg-ruled Kingdom of Greece in Greece minus Thrace, which [Thrace] is [Thrace] given to Bulgaria along with Macedonia after a coup restores the Catholic side branch of the original German royal house of the current British imperial family, the German House of of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the German-Hungarian House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry-ruled Tsardom of Bulgaria to power in post Soviet Bulgaria. The pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy is [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] also [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] restored [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] as the government [the pre-1947 Kingdom of Italy] of Italy with elements taken from fascist Italy under Mussolini and Italy regains Libya as a restored Italian North Africa, and Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Somaliland as a restored Italian Africa, although the Bourbons become the Italian royal family instead of the Savoys, who [the Savoys] are instead the monarchs [the Savoys] of the restored African sub kingdoms [the restored Italian North Africa and the restored Italian East Africa] inside the Kingdom of Italy. This restored Kingdom of Italy is in effect an Austrian satellite state. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restored German Empire] restoring the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper through the reenforcement of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The 1991 coup by hardline elements of the Soviet combined land, air and sea combat forces, the Soviet Armed Forces in the post-Soviet successor state of the oligarch and KGB-controlled Russian Federation is greeted by an combined invasion of Russia and Mongolia by NATO, the Imperial State of Iran, the Mongolian Autonomous Federation and Japan which results in the fall of both the Russian Federation and Japan. Japan restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast while [Japan] restoring the Bogd Khan-ruled Bogd Khanate of Mongolia in Outer Mongolia and the various greater Mongolian territories taken by both the Romanov Czars of Russia and the Soviets over the years and the parts of Inner Mongolia unclaimed by the restored Mengjiang, [Japan] also restoring the Kingdom of Tannu Uriankhai in the Russian Tuva Republic. The restored German Empire restores the Novgorod Republic in Northern Russia and the restored Austria-Hungary restores the German-Danish-Russian Imperial House of Romanov-ruled pre-1917 Russian Empire in European Russia. The Kingdom of Jordan also annexes Isreal, Palestine and Lebanon and the short-lived Arab Royal House of Hashim-ruled Kingdom of Syria is also restored in Syria, [the restored Kingdom of Syria] annexing Jordan to form a Levantine Federation. The Hashemites are also restored to power in Iraq after the mysterious death of Saddam Hussein via a Soviet spy ring in the now-defunct Israeli Mossad. Iran retakes Azerbaijan and Dagestan along with Uzbekistan, Tajikstan and Turkmenistan to form Greater Iran As the 20th century comes to an end, the world is divided into multiple power blocs, NATO, which [NATO] has [NATO] become a modern-day version of the WW1-era Central Powers and the EU, which [the EU] is the Germanic Mittlemache [Middle Europe] WW1 era European community in all but name ruling over Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals in the name of liberal constitutional monarchy, the Arab League consisting of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the restored Kingdom of Syria and the restored Kingdom of Iraq which [the Arab League] dominates the Arab world and the Islamic community, the British Commonwealth which has returned to being the British Empire in all but name, having taken the Southern US away from the USA in the form a restored Democrat Party-ruled Confederacy, the Vietnamese, Indonesian and Malay-dominated ASEAN which effectively controls South East Asia and [ASEAN] has the restored Kingdom of Tibet and a restored House of Kawānanakoa-ruled Kingdom of Hawaii in a post-US occcupation Hawaii as member states and the Association of East Asia, consisting of Japan, the restored Empire of China, the restored Tang Empire, the restored Far Eastern Republic, the restored Mongolian Autonomous Federation, the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia, the restored Kumul Khanate, the Pacific States of America consisting of the US states on the USA's West Coast and the restored Kingdom of Tannu Uriankhai By the start of the 21th century, the world is very different from what it was during the Cold War, with the USA being reduced to a third rate power relying on selling arms to any third-world banana republic with enough money to pay for said arms. The primarily medical-based British megacorp with an interest in shipping, mechanics, consumer electronics and heavy industry Umbrella Corporation [Resident Evil] and its [Umbrella's] parent company, the mysterious British mega-conglomerate TRICELL [Resident Evil] games, [Umbrella and TRICELL] secretly compete in the weapons industry with the American defense contractor and international weapons research and development company known as the Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee [Dead or Alive franchise], with Umbrella developing the powerful and extremely versatile sets of symbiotic tactical-combat armor made out of a combination of artificial muscle with the ability to |the artificial muscule| be programmed via voice or mental command by the wearer to perform tasks such as hardening, muscle augmentation or camouflage during combat), leading to drastically enhanced combat and physical performance, allowing the operator to execute superhuman feats. and the Ionic Electroactive Polymer (EAP) Liquid Armor (a fast-twitch reflex co-polymer incorporating colloidal doped ceramics and a copper nanolattice in an ethylene-glycol buckyball matrix |the EAP liquid armor|) which [the EAP liquid armor] gives the wearer unparalleled protection against radiation and physical impact along with drastically increases motor reflexes, [the EAP liquid armor] also featuring a dynamic Faraday anti-EMP mesh, |the suits'| having their |the suits'| own Semiautonomous Enhanced Combat Ops: Neuro-integration Delivery AI (SECOND) which [SECOND] is [SECOND] powered by a parasitic blood-glucose infusion and an electrolytic micro-stack, [SECOND] runing at 1.5 BIPS and [SECOND] instantly integrating remote telemetry and first-person input from up to 6,000 distinct channels (ranging from full spectrum EM to acoustic, barometric, and pheromonal) presenting clear, concise tactical summaries via an interface integrated directly in the visual cortex, [SECOND] also having the ability to [SECOND] take over the operator's purely autonomic and regulatory functions in the event of somatic damage and [SECOND] not only monitorings the physical and neurological state of the soldier [wearing the suit], but to actually optimize them, [SECOND] continuously regulating dopamine, lactic acid, and corticosteroid levels, anticipates and [SECOND] counteracting debilitating stress and fatigue reactions, with the suits also actively augmenting and maintaining their [the suits'] wearer's adrenaline, GABA, and tricyclic levels, [the suits] being known as the Nanosuits [Crysis franchise] as the ultimate BOW [Biological Weapon |BOW|].

Tabane is [Tabane] Koyomi's childhood friend [Tabane] whom [Tabane] he [Koyumi] met during his [Koyumi's] vacation at [where the Araragis went for vacation] Kamakura when he [Koyumi] was just seven years old, whom [Tabane] he [Koyumi] remembers as \\"Kaede\\". Tabane remembers him [Koyumi] as \\"Kohta\\" and [Tabane] has [Tabane] fantasies of marrying him [Kohta] although she [Tabane] is [Tabane] at least ten years older [Tabane] than him [Koyumi]. Tabane is currently incognito in the human world under the disguise of the college-age, college-attending, dark-purple-haired, blue-eyed, sharp-tongued, blunt, harsh and somewhat emotional but sincere and cheerful rich human girl Senjōgahara Hitagi [Bakemonogatari] after [Tabane] almost dying [Tabane] in a fight between Taimanin operatives and USS operatives on an Umbrella research lab and [Tabane] then having her [Tabane's] soul seperated from her [Tabane's] original body and [Tabane] possessing the then-comatose's real Hitagi's body, [Tabane] using the real Hitagi's body to [Tabane] move around and [Tabane] eventually creating another body for her [Tabane] to use based on her [Tabane's] DNA that [Tabane's DNA] she [Tabane] had [Tabane] kept around beforehand and Hitagi's DNA, [Tabane] moving into the new body and [Tabane] having the real Hitagi's body in cold storage while [Tabane] still living under the alias of Hitagi.

DOATEC's founder, the African-American genius and infamous playboy known as Fame Douglas [Dead or Alive franchise], [Fame] found out about the Nanosuits in the late 2010s and [Fame] wanted to expose Umbrella's evil deeds to the world, so he [Fame] was [Fame] assassinated by[who assassinates Fame] a combined death squad of Umbrella's combined elite special forces/special operations paramilitary division with branches specially trained and equipped for different situations, ranging from guarding Umbrella facilities and concentration camps to covert operations, Umbrella Security Service [Resident Evil Franchise] agents and corrupt British SAS operatives and MI6 agents on the secret dole from both Umbrella and TRICELL and his [Fame's] death covered up as an accident, with his eldest daughter and the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, haughty and unconcerned with others half-French, half-American opera singer and pigua quan martial artist Helena Douglas [Dead or Alive franchise], who [Helena] initially has no idea she [Helena] is [Helena] is his [Fame's] daughter [Helena] becomes the next CEO [Helena after Fame's death ] of DOATEC, [Helena] having no idea DOATEC, which [DOATEC] is [DOATEC] known [DOATEC] for holding riginally an annual, world-wide fighting tournament for fighters to take part in to win large cash prizes known as the Dead or Alive Touranments [Dead or Alive franchise], [DOATEC] is [DOATEC] involved in arms manufacturing or the arms trade at all. The excerpt should focus on Kasumi and Ayame both [Kasumi and Ayane] sneaking into the Araragi mansion after [Kasumi and Ayane] investigating an Umbrella base in the USA, [Kasumi and Ayane] both [Kasumi and Ayame] preparing to be Karen and Tsukihi again even as they [Kasumi and Ayame] prepare to [Kasumi and Ayane] infiltrate this year's DOA tournament as fighters in order to [Kasumi and Ayane] gather intelligence on the blonde-haired, suit-wearing, black mas-wearing, ruthless, manipulating and Machelevian Victor Donovan [Dead or Alive franchise], the majority owner [Victor] of DOATEC, [Victor] working with Umbrella on a joint project to create the ultimate fighter. As both girls [Kasumi and Ayane] carefully make their [Kasumi's and Ayane's] way towards their [Kasumi's and Ayane's] respective bedrooms to change from their [Kasumi's and Ayame's] respective skintight, bullet-proof, combat bodysuits/wetsuits that they [Kasumi and Ayane] wear as kunoichi [Kasumi and Ayane] of the Mugen Tenshin ninja clan, only for them [Kasumi and Ayane] to be [Kasumi and Ayane] spotted as they [Kasumi and Ayane] change back into Karen and Tsukihi by Koyumi, who [Koyumi] had [Koyumi] left his [Koyumi's] room for a snack and noticed his [Koyumi's] beloved little sisters [Karen and Tsukihi] sneaking into the house while [Karen and Tsukihi] looking like a combination of a spec ops warrior and a old time shinobi.","output":"In the dead of night, when the boundary between worlds thins and shadows whisper secrets, the serene Araragi mansion lies silent. Within its walls, under the guise of average teenagers, lie secrets far deeper and dangerous than one might dare to imagine. Karen Araragi and Tsukihi Araragi, known to a select few as Kasumi and Ayane of the covert Mugen Tenshin ninja clan, slip into the grounds with the grace of phantoms, their mission weighing heavy upon their hearts. Fresh from a harrowing op in an Umbrella base on American soil, the two Taimanin-trained kunoichi had survived a maze of horrors, barely escaping with the data needed to unravel the looming threat of an alliance between DOATEC and Umbrella. Each moment away from vigilant eyes was a moment to inch closer to their true selves, to shed the skins of their warrior fronts and become once again the daughters of the Araragi household. As they neared the back entrance, the ephemeral moonlight flooded the tatami corridor, bathing it in a ghostly glow. Silently, they communicated with a look—one that spoke of years of sisterhood and partnership. Kasumi’s hand hovered over the sliding door, but paused. Was it intuition or fate that made them wait? The sound of a floorboard creaking betrayed the presence of another—Koyumi, serene and mindful, stepping out for a midnight indulgence, his striking resemblance to the girls a testament to their shared blood. Koyumi’s eyes fell upon the figures of his younger siblings, who he observed in bemusement; Karen and Tsukihi, two parts of his world that he believed he understood. Yet beneath the moon’s watchful eye, they stood transformed into enigmas, their defense-grade bodysuits adorned with shuriken and kunai telling a story beyond the mundane life he expected them to lead. Their eyes met, and in that moment, the siblings’ worlds collided with a stark revelation. The truth was undeniable, tangible, exposed as surely as the figures of Kasumi and Ayane emerged from beneath the silent veneer of the Araragi sisters. \\"Karen? Tsukihi?\\" Koyumi’s whisper sliced through the tense air, a quivering mixture of confusion and the dawning of intrigue. His mind raced to piece together the puzzle before him, the gravity of their double lives settling upon him like the weight of the night itself. Karen, now Kasumi, held her gaze steady, her expression the cool reflection of a seasoned warrior’s stoicism. Beside her, Tsukihi, under the mantle of Ayane, clenched her fists, the inner turmoil of the hyperactive and manic energy she harbored just beneath the surface. But even with their covers blown, their mission remained unchanged and the clock showed no mercy. \\"We can explain, Koyumi,\\" Kasumi began, but there was no time for words; explanations would come later, after the storm they were to face had passed. The infiltration of the DOA tournament awaited, and with it the next phase of their clandestine operations. In the quiet defiance of the night, the two parted from their brother, slipping back into the darkness from whence they came, the essence of Karen and Tsukihi receding like spirits at daybreak. Left behind in the silent house, Koyumi grappled with reality redefining itself, the lives of his sisters expanding into a grand tapestry woven with threads of espionage, duty, and blood—a narrative far from over, an action yet to unfold."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Javelin: “So, Laffey, there’s something I’m curious about…” Laffey: “What is it, Javelin?” Javelin: “Well, I’ve noticed that you always seem so…laid back.

Here's a breakdown of some of these reasons and tips on how they can overcome such discomfort in a healthy way: 1. Social Conditioning and Gender Norms: - Many societies historically valued male dominance and female submissiveness, and these attitudes can persist. - Men may feel threatened by assertive women because it challenges traditional gender roles and their own sense of status or superiority. Overcoming Discomfort: - Reflect on and challenge personal beliefs about gender roles. Consider where these ideas came from and whether they're truly applicable today. - Educate oneself about feminism and gender equality, learning to respect women's autonomy and authority. 2. Insecurity or Intimidation: - Some men may feel insecure or inadequate when faced with a confident woman, fearing that their own abilities or status are being overshadowed. - They might not be used to being challenged or might feel that their masculinity is in question. Overcoming Discomfort: - Work on self-esteem and confidence by setting personal goals and celebrating achievements, regardless of others' success. - Recognize that assertive women, like assertive men, are simply expressing confidence and ambition, not attacking anyone else's worth. 3. Peer Pressure and Cultural Expectations: - Male social groups sometimes perpetuate stereotypes about women and reinforce negative attitudes towards assertiveness in women. - There can be cultural expectations for men to be the \\"strong\\" ones, adding pressure to conform to these norms. Overcoming Discomfort: - Seek diverse friendships and social groups that respect gender equality. - Be mindful of the influence of peers and the media, and actively choose to question and confront stereotypes. 4. Fear of Change: - Changing dynamics in relationships, workplaces, or society can be unsettling. - Men might feel that assertive women are altering the status quo, leading to uncertainty about their own roles and the future. Overcoming Discomfort: - Recognize that change can lead to progress and that diverse perspectives and leadership styles are beneficial. - Focus on adaptability and learning how to work with and benefit from new dynamics. 5. Personal History: - Past experiences with authoritative figures, including parents, could influence how someone responds to assertive individuals. - Negative experiences might cause general discomfort around assertive people, not just women. Overcoming Discomfort: - Seek to understand one's reactions and possibly seek therapy to address past traumas or ingrained patterns. - Practice empathy and try to understand the reasons behind others' assertiveness. 6. Lack of Exposure: - Limited experience interacting with assertive women can lead to uncertainty about how to respond to them. - Stereotypes and misunderstandings fill the gaps where there is a lack of real-world interaction. Overcoming Discomfort: - Engage more with assertive women in professional and social settings. - Look for role models in both genders who exhibit positive, assertive qualities. Ultimately, working through discomfort involves self-reflection, challenging inherited societal views, and actively working towards a greater understanding and appreciation of equality. It also means recognizing that attributes like assertiveness are not inherently gendered, but universal qualities that can be found and valued in any person."},{"instruction":"write an in character dialogue scene involving Lucio shyly expressing his feelings to Bridgette, who demands he spit it out after he stutters so much before coming out with it, which she finds cute.","output":"[INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY] Lucio and Bridgette are sitting across from each other at a small table.

Depending on the canon from which these characters originate (since they aren't widely recognized characters from well-known media), you'd need to establish clear motivations, character growth, and circumstances that allow their relationship to evolve organically. Here's a framework for how their romance might unfold: 1. Establishing Context: - Provide a background for each character that explains who they are, their past relationships, and what they're looking for in a partner. - Identify any situational factors that bring Lucio and Bridgette together, like a shared workplace, mutual friends, or common interests. 2. Building Chemistry: - Show the characters enjoying each other's company in various settings, highlighting their compatibility. - Incorporate moments of emotional connection where Lucio and Bridgette share personal stories or support each other during challenges. 3. Conflict and Growth: - Introduce realistic obstacles that they need to overcome, such as misunderstandings, external pressures, or personal fears. - Allow both characters to grow individually and together by learning from their experiences. For example, Lucio could become more assertive while Bridgette becomes more patient. 4. Mutual Respect: - Make sure both characters have equal narrative importance and agency. Lucio and Bridgette should respect one another's goals, boundaries, and personal developments. - Their relationship should be a partnership where both contribute and compromise. 5. Development of Trust and Vulnerability: - Highlight moments where the characters demonstrate trust in one another, such as sharing vulnerabilities or secrets. - Showcase how they respond to these displays of trust, offering support, understanding, or empathy. 6. Integration with the Wider Story: - Ensure that the romance doesn't exist in a vacuum but interacts with other elements of the story, such as their social network or the main plot. - Have friends, family, or co-workers comment on or react to the burgeoning relationship. 7. Realistic Pacing: - Let the relationship develop at a pace that feels natural and authentic, not rushing into deep commitment or dragging their interactions out too long. - Build tension and anticipation through near-misses and close moments that tease their eventual coming together. 8. Resolving the Tension: - Eventually, have Lucio and Bridgette confront their feelings for each other, whether through a grand romantic gesture or an honest, private conversation. - Create a satisfying payoff for the audience who has followed their journey, showing both the struggles and the joys of their union. By focusing on these aspects, you'd be able to weave a love story between Lucio and Bridgette that is both believable and engaging, allowing audiences to understand and root for their relationship."},{"instruction":"these characters are from overwatch.","output":"My apologies for the misunderstanding. In the Overwatch universe, characters named Lucio and Brigitte do exist, yet as of my last knowledge update in early 2023, there has not been an established romantic relationship between the two in canon material provided by Blizzard Entertainment. Lucio Correia dos Santos is a Brazilian DJ and freedom fighter, while Brigitte Lindholm is a Swedish engineer and adventurer. However, if you're creating a fan fiction or hypothetical scenario where Lucio and Brigitte were to develop a romantic relationship, you'd want to consider their personalities, backgrounds, and the established lore of Overwatch to craft a story that feels true to their characters while also grounding the relationship in reality. Here's a speculative take on how a romance between them might work, taking into account their backstories and dispositions: 1. **Common Ground**: They both have strong senses of justice and a desire to protect others, which could be the basis for their bond. Their paths might cross during an Overwatch mission or while independently aiding civilians, leading to mutual respect and camaraderie. 2. **Complementary Personalities**: Lucio's upbeat and energetic personality might complement Brigitte's more serious and focused nature. Lucio could help Brigitte unwind and let loose, while Brigitte could provide Lucio with a steady and supportive partnership. 3. **Progression Through Missions**: As members of Overwatch, they might spend a lot of time together on missions. Shared experiences, both harrowing and exciting, could forge a deep connection between them, evolving from teamwork to friendship to something more. 4. **Balancing Strengths**: Lucio's area-of-effect support through his music could synergize well with Brigitte's defensive front-line abilities, leading to a reliance on each other in battle. This mutual dependence could be mirrored in an emotional connection off the battlefield. 5. **Cultural Exchange**: Brigitte might become intrigued by Lucio's passion for music and culture, leading them to exchange stories about their homelands, traditions, and families. These shared experiences could be a catalyst for a romantic spark. 6. **Challenges and Conflict**: Both come from very different worlds, and their romantic relationship would likely have its trials. These could stem from differences in lifestyle, communication styles, or priorities. By overcoming these challenges, they would demonstrate the strength of their relationship. 7. **Natural Development**: Rather than forcing a rapid romantic development, their relationship could grow organically through the series of shared missions, downtime, and conversations. Moments of vulnerability, like post-mission debriefs or caring for one another after an injury, might accelerate their bonding. 8. **Genuine Feelings**: Any romantic declaration should feel genuine. Lucio might use a heartfelt song to express his feelings, or Brigitte could craft something special to show her affection, allowing their true personalities to shine through in their pursuit of romance. It's key to maintain the integrity of the characters as they are understood by the Overwatch community. Staying true to their ideologies, speech patterns, and general demeanor will make any fan-created romance feel more believable and satisfying for those familiar with the Overwatch narrative."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

As a Chief Data Officer (CDO) overseeing the development of a data model for a rideshare company, a star schema is an excellent approach to organize data for analytical purposes. The star schema is a type of dimensional data modeling that includes one central fact table surrounded by several dimension tables. The fact table contains quantitative data (facts) about each transaction, while the dimension tables contain descriptive attributes related to the facts. We will create a star schema centered around rideshare activities. Here's an overview of a possible star schema: **Fact Table: Rides** - RideID (PK) - DriverID (FK) - CustomerID (FK) - VehicleID (FK) - PaymentID (FK) - PromoID (FK) - TimeID (FK) - StartLocationID (FK) - EndLocationID (FK) - RideDistance - RideDuration - RideCost - TipAmount - TotalAmount **Dimension Tables:** 1. **Driver** - DriverID (PK) - Name - LicenseNumber - Rating - StartDate - HomeBaseRegion 2. **Customer** - CustomerID (PK) - Name - PhoneNumber - Email - LoyaltyTier - JoinDate 3. **Vehicle** - VehicleID (PK) - Make - Model - Year - Color - Capacity - VehicleType 4. **Payment** - PaymentID (PK) - PaymentType - PaymentProvider - PaymentDate 5. **Promotions** - PromoID (PK) - PromoCode - DiscountAmount - StartDate - EndDate - MinimumRideAmount 6. **Time** - TimeID (PK) - Date - Time - DayOfWeek - WeekOfYear - Month - Quarter - Year 7. **Location** - LocationID (PK) - Address - City - State - ZipCode - Country - Latitude - Longitude - LocationType (e.g., 'Pickup' or 'Dropoff') This star schema allows for a wide array of analytical queries to be performed on the rideshare data. Here are a few examples of the types of queries this schema would support: - Calculate total revenue by driver, customer, vehicle, or over a certain time period. - Measure the impact of promotions on ride frequency and revenue. - Analyze ride patterns to optimize driver locations and availability. - Examine the effect of external factors, such as holidays or local events, on demand for rides. - Understand customer loyalty through engagement and usage over time. With the above star schema, the rideshare company can perform OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations efficiently, such as slicing (filtering on one dimension), dicing (filtering on two or more dimensions), drilling down/up (navigating among levels of data ranging from the most summarized to the most detailed), and pivoting (reorienting the multidimensional view of data). Additionally, the schema facilitates the generation of business intelligence dashboards and reports that can help the company make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency."},{"instruction":"How to measure success for the company to find KPI data?","output":"Measuring success for a rideshare company involves identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with the company's strategic goals. KPIs should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Here are several KPIs that a rideshare company might track using the data available in our previously discussed star schema: 1. **Rides Completed**: Total number of rides successfully completed within a timeframe. This reflects the demand for the service and operational success. 2. **Ride Revenue**: The sum of the TotalAmount in the Fact Rides table, which reflects the financial performance relating to the rides. 3. **Average Ride Cost**: The average cost of rides, which could be calculated by dividing Ride Revenue by the number of Rides Completed. This measures pricing strategy effectiveness. 4. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Total cost of sales and marketing efforts divided by the number of new customers acquired in a period. This is critical for understanding the cost of business growth. 5. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**: Predicted net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. CLTV helps in understanding the long-term value of retaining customers. 6. **Driver Turnover Rate**: The rate at which drivers leave the platform. This can be calculated by dividing the number of drivers who have left by the average number of active drivers during a period. 7. **Rider Retention Rate**: Percentage of customers who continue to use the service over time. It is important for understanding customer loyalty and satisfaction. 8. **Average Rating per Driver/Customer**: Derived from the Driver and Customer dimension tables, the average rating KPI can reflect the quality of service and customer satisfaction. 9. **Promotion Usage Rate**: The percentage of rides using a promotion (PromoID) vs. total rides. This assesses the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. 10. **Utilization Rate**: The percentage of time drivers are carrying passengers vs. available time. A higher utilization rate suggests efficiency in matching drivers with riders. 11. **Customer Churn Rate**: The percentage of customers who discontinue using the rideshare service during a given period. This KPI is critical for customer service and retention strategies. 12. **Ride Acceptance and Cancellation Rates**: How often drivers accept ride requests and how often either drivers or riders cancel rides, indicating operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. 13. **Service Area Coverage**: The number of unique cities or ZIP codes serviced over a period, which indicates expansion or market penetration. 14. **Surge Pricing Impact**: Additional revenue or rides completed during surge pricing times, which shows the efficacy of dynamic pricing in balancing supply and demand. 15. **Wait Time**: The average or median time customers wait for a ride. Lower wait times typically improve customer satisfaction. 16. **Ridesharing Metrics**: For the carpooling aspect of the service, metrics like average passengers per trip or percentage of trips that are shared can be analyzed. To find the data for these KPIs, you would query the fact and dimension tables in your star schema, aggregating and analyzing the related data points. Typically, you'd use a business intelligence (BI) tool connected to your data warehouse to visualize these KPIs in dashboards for regular reporting. For most KPIs, you will apply filters, aggregates, and calculations on the data to derive the insights needed to inform business strategies and objectives. With modern data platforms, these queries can be automated to provide real-time or near-real-time monitoring of performance against benchmarks and goals."},{"instruction":"Can you prioritize out of all the metrics that you built and detail explain why to make this choice?","output":"Prioritizing KPIs depends on the strategic objectives of the rideshare company. However, most businesses in this sector focus on growth, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and profitability. Based on these common goals, let's prioritize some of the KPIs I mentioned and explain why they are critical: 1. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**: - **Why**: It's a key metric for understanding the long-term financial contribution of each customer. High CLTV can indicate strong customer loyalty and satisfaction, which are essential for sustained growth. It also helps to determine how much should be invested in acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones. 2. **Ride Revenue & Average Ride Cost**: - **Why**: Revenue is the lifeblood of a business, and for a rideshare company, the revenue from rides is fundamental. Directly linked to profitability, it needs to be monitored closely. Average Ride Cost is important to keep a check on whether the per-ride income aligns with the company's pricing strategy and costs. 3. **Rides Completed**: - **Why**: The number of rides completed is a direct performance indicator. It measures demand and service consumption, which is essential for evaluating company growth. An increase in completed rides typically indicates successful market expansion and operational success. 4. **Rider Retention Rate**: - **Why**: Retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This KPI directly impacts CLTV and can signal customer satisfaction with the service's reliability, convenience, and cost. 5. **Driver Turnover Rate**: - **Why**: Drivers are a critical component of the rideshare ecosystem. A high turnover rate can indicate dissatisfaction among drivers, which can reduce the number of available rides and negatively impact customer service. 6. **Utilization Rate**: - **Why**: Efficiency is key for profit margins. The higher the utilization rate, the more time drivers spend on paid rides versus waiting for assignments. It has a direct impact on driver earnings, company revenue, and operational cost-efficiency. 7. **Promotion Usage Rate**: - **Why**: Evaluates the effectiveness of marketing efforts. Ideally, promotions should lead to an increase in ride frequency and attract new users, without significantly cannibalizing revenue from full-priced rides. 8. **Wait Time**: - **Why**: Customer experience is critical, and wait time is a important component of this. Shorter wait times lead to higher customer satisfaction and retention. 9. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: - **Why**: Measures the efficiency of the company's marketing investments. Keeping CAC lower than CLTV is important; if CAC grows too high, it could lead to unsustainable growth. 10. **Average Rating per Driver/Customer**: - **Why**: Quality service leads to customer satisfaction. Regularly monitoring this metric ensures that highly rated drivers are retained and incentivized, and low ratings can be a trigger for investigations and improvements. 11. **Service Area Coverage**: - **Why**: This metric matters for growth and market saturation analysis. It can help in strategic decision-making about where to allocate resources and where market opportunities exist. 12. **Surge Pricing Impact**: - **Why**: Ensures that surge pricing is effectively managing supply and demand while not deterring customers with excessive prices. The priority of these KPIs may change over time as the company evolves and as strategic objectives shift. For instance, at an early stage, customer acquisition might be a higher priority, shifting towards CLTV and retention as the company matures. Regularly reviewing the KPIs and adjusting strategies accordingly is crucial for sustained success. Ultimately, the prioritization of these KPIs is highly contextual and should be revisited periodically to reflect the changing business environment and internal goals of the company."},{"instruction":"What does the table look like if it includes all metrics that you built above? you can extend your previous table design if needed.","output":"Creating a single table that includes all the metrics built above would not align with the best practices of database design and data warehousing concepts such as the star schema, which separates transactional data (facts) and contextual data (dimensions). However, for analysis and reporting purposes, we can use a view or a report that aggregates the data into higher-level KPIs for decision-making. In practice, these KPIs would often be calculated within a Business Intelligence (BI) tool or through SQL queries on the star schema data warehouse. However, for the purpose of illustration, here's how you could represent a simplified summary table that includes some of the key metrics: \`\`\`plaintext | KPI Summary Report | |--------------------------------------| | Metric | Value | |-----------------------|--------------| | Rides Completed | agg_count | | Ride Revenue | sum | | Average Ride Cost | avg | | Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | calculation | | Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) | calculation | | Driver Turnover Rate | calculation | | Rider Retention Rate | calculation | | Average Rating (Driver) | avg | | Average Rating (Customer) | avg | | Promotion Usage Rate | calculation | | Utilization Rate | calculation | | Wait Time | avg | | Service Area Coverage | unique_count | | Surge Pricing Impact | calculation | | ... | ... | \`\`\` Here's an explanation of how each metric might be calculated: - **agg_count**: Aggregated count, such as a count of total rides. - **sum**: Summation, such as the total revenue from all rides. - **avg**: Average, such as the average cost of rides or average wait time. - **calculation**: A more complex calculation that may involve multiple tables and joins, such as calculating the CAC or CLTV. - **unique_count**: Count of distinct values, such as the number of unique service areas. Some of these metrics, like CLTV or CAC, would require historical data and possibly predictive modeling and would be the result of individual complex calculations or even data science models rather than simple aggregates. These would not typically reside in a single table within your database but rather be output of scheduled reports or dashboards. However, for the purpose of this exercise, you can see how these different metrics might be summarized in a high-level report to guide business decision-making. In practice, you would also include time dimensions (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually) to track changes in these KPIs over time."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

The concept of loop invariants is borrowed from iterative loops, where they serve as important tools for reasoning about the correctness of algorithms. When you translate that concept to recursion, the invariant becomes a property that must hold at each level of the recursive call in order for the algorithm to work correctly. A recursive function typically involves two main parts: the base case(s), where the recursion terminates, and the recursive step(s), where the function calls itself with a different argument. A loop invariant in recursion helps ensure that every recursive step moves the problem closer to a base case, and that when a base case is reached, the problem is solved correctly. To explain this more comprehensively, let's look at a classic example: computing the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number \`n\`, written as \`n!\`, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \`n\`. \`\`\`python def factorial(n): # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1 if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1 # Recursive step: n! = n * (n-1)! else: return n * factorial(n - 1) \`\`\` In this example, the loop invariant is the mathematical definition of factorial itself: at each step of the recursion (each frame of the call stack), the function calculates the product of the current number \`n\` and the factorial of \`n-1\`. The loop invariant ensures that if we correctly calculate \`(n-1)!\`, then multiplying it by \`n\` will give us the correct \`n!\`. Before each call to \`factorial(n - 1)\`, the implicit loop invariant is that this call will return the factorial of \`n - 1\`. After the call returns and before it multiplies the result by \`n\`, the invariant still holds—if \`factorial(n - 1)\` behaves correctly, then \`factorial(n)\` will output the correct result. Ensuring that the loop invariant holds at each step of the recursion is critical for the function to work correctly. This is how you could reason about the loop invariant for the \`factorial\` function: 1. Initialization: Before the first recursive call is made (for instance, \`factorial(5)\`), you believe that the function definition correctly computes factorials because it is based on the correct mathematical formula. 2. Maintenance: The invariant is maintained across each recursive call. If you assume that \`factorial(n - 1)\` correctly computes \`(n - 1)!\`, then \`n * factorial(n - 1)\` will correctly compute \`n!\`. This step ensures that the recursive function brings the problem state closer to a base case without breaking the expected behavior. 3. Termination: Finally, the base case ensures termination of the recursion. When \`n\` becomes 0 or 1, the function returns 1, and no further recursive calls are made. At this point, the loop invariant is the base condition itself (\`0! = 1\` and \`1! = 1\`), meaning the function correctly computed the factorial down to the base case. By reasoning about the loop invariant at each step of the recursion, you can argue for the correctness of the algorithm. If the invariant holds true before and after every recursive call, and if it correctly computes the base cases, then the recursive algorithm should correctly solve the problem for any valid input."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A ripoff involves a person being deceived or taken advantage of, typically in a financial transaction. It can also be used to describe something that is an unoriginal or shameless copy or imitation of another work, idea, or product, implying a lack of authenticity or creativity."},{"instruction":"What are some superman ripoffs","output":"Over the years, many characters in various media have been inspired by or directly imitated aspects of Superman, the iconic superhero created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Some of these characters could be considered \\"ripoffs\\" or homages, depending on the level of originality and the intent behind their creation. Here are a few examples: 1. Hyperion - Marvel Comics has a character named Hyperion who has appeared in various incarnations. Some versions of Hyperion are very similar to Superman, with comparable powers and an analogous backstory. 2. Supreme - Created by Rob Liefeld and later refined by Alan Moore, Supreme is an Image Comics character who was initially a pastiche of Superman, with similar powers and a parallel moral code. 3. Gladiator (Kallark) - Another Marvel character, Gladiator is a member of the Shi'ar Empire's Imperial Guard and possesses super strength, flight, and heat vision, much like Superman. 4. Sentry - Created by Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee for Marvel Comics, the Sentry has immense power and a dual identity, akin to Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent. However, the Sentry also deals with mental health issues, providing a different twist on the superhero archetype. 5. Omni-Man - From the Image Comics series \\"Invincible\\" by Robert Kirkman, Omni-Man is a character that shares many similarities with Superman, including being an alien with comparable powers, but with notable differences in character and narrative. 6. Apollo - A member of the superhero team \\"The Authority\\" in the Wildstorm universe (later incorporated into DC Comics), Apollo is openly gay and has superhuman abilities similar to Superman's. 7. Captain Marvel (Shazam) - While not exactly a \\"ripoff,\\" Fawcett Comics' (later acquired by DC Comics) Captain Marvel, now known as Shazam, was created with the intent to capitalize on the success of Superman. The character has similar powers and a strong moral code, though the source of his powers is magical, and his persona is distinct. The character's similarity eventually led to a legal battle with DC in the early days. 8. Plutonian - From the comic series \\"Irredeemable,\\" created by Mark Waid, the Plutonian starts as a hero resembling Superman but turns into a villain, showing a dark reflection of what a being with such powers could become. These characters borrow elements from Superman's mythology, but many take those elements in unique or interesting directions, avoiding a straight ripoff and instead offering an homage or an exploration of similar concepts."},{"instruction":"could you write an upn trailer on a animaed sitcom Einstone based on The Wacky World of Tex Avery about a a brilliant caveman, Ughbert Einstone, who is the world's first inventor.

If the range exceeds the current date when retrieving past dates, the system will instead display dates extending into the future, ensuring a total of thirty days are shown. - *Example*: If today is March 7 and the departure date is set for March 10, the system will display fares from March 7 to April 6, covering a thirty-day span. 3. **Complete Fare Details**: All available fare details for each day within the thirty-day window should be shown simultaneously upon triggering the calendar. 4. **Lowest Fare Display**: The calendar will showcase the lowest available price in Avios for each day within the thirty-day period, given such fares are accessible. 5. **Additional Information Representation**: Besides the fare, the calendar will include the date, month, and off-peak status, following the pre-established business rules. 6. **Unavailable Dates Handling**: Dates for which the lowest fare is not available will be denoted as ‘Not Available’ and will be non-interactive (users cannot select these dates). 7. **Flight Availability Messaging**: If there are no flights available for the initial and subsequent thirty-day windows, the system must display a \\"Flights do not exist\\" message to inform the user. 8. **Extended Calendar Overview**: Users should have the option to view fare information for up to 365 days in advance, limited by the current date when reviewing past availability. **Additional Considerations:** - **Usability**: Ensure the calendar is intuitive and fits within the existing UI design, providing a seamless user experience. - **Performance**: Optimize loading times for fare information to prevent delays when the thirty-day calendar is accessed. - **Accessibility**: The calendar and fare details should be accessible to users with disabilities, complying with WCAG guidelines. - **Error Handling**: Adequate feedback must be provided in case of API errors or connectivity issues preventing the calendar from displaying correct information. - **Caching Strategies**: Consider implementing caching mechanisms for fare data to enhance performance and reduce unnecessary API calls. **Scenarios to Consider:** - A user selects a departure date that is less than 15 days in the future or past. - A user tries to access fare information exceeding the 365-day advance limit. - A user encounters days where no fares are available for an extended period. - Peak and off-peak days and how they should be differentiated in the calendar view. Please consider these requirements and let me know if there are any questions or further clarifications needed. Provide estimates of the effort involved and identify any potential risks or dependencies on other systems or features. --- Remember to schedule a meeting or have a discussion with your development team to walk through these requirements, answer any questions they might have, and gather feedback.

However, the terms of service and enforcement strategies used by prominent AI companies to deter model misuse have disincentives on good faith safety evaluations. This causes some researchers to fear that conducting such research or releasing their findings will result in account suspensions or legal reprisal. Although some companies offer researcher access programs, they are an inadequate substitute for independent research access, as they have limited community representation, receive inadequate funding, and lack independence from corporate incentives. We propose that major AI developers commit to providing a legal and technical safe harbor, indemnifying public interest safety research and protecting it from the threat of account suspensions or legal reprisal. These proposals emerged from our collective experience conducting safety, privacy, and trustworthiness research on generative AI systems, where norms and incentives could be better aligned with public interests, without exacerbating model misuse. We believe these commitments are a necessary step towards more inclusive and unimpeded community efforts to tackle the risks of generative AI. 1. Introduction Generative AI systems have been deployed rapidly in recent years, amassing hundreds of millions of users. These systems have already raised concerns for widespread misuse, bias (Deshpande et al., 2023), hate speech (Douglas Heaven, 1MIT 2 Princeton University 3 Stanford University 4Georgetown University 5AI Risk and Vulnerability Alliance 6Eleuther AI 7Brown University 8Carnegie Mellon University 9Virginia Tech 10Northeastern University 11UCSB 12University of Pennsylvania 13UIUC. * Corresponding author. ** Equal contribution.

To ensure sufficient public scrutiny and accountability, such high-impact systems should be evaluated (Liang et al., 2023; Solaiman et al., 2023; Weidinger et al., 2023) by independent and external entities (Raji et al., 2022; Birhane et al., 2024). Despite this, leading generative AI companies provide limited transparency and access into their systems, with transparent audits showing only 25% of policy enforcement and evaluation criteria were satisfied on average (Bommasani et al., 2023a); and with no company providing reproducible evaluations to characterize the effectiveness of their risk mitigations. Leading AI companies’ terms of service prohibit independent evaluation into most sensitive model flaws (see Table 3). While these terms act as a deterrent to malicious behavior, they also restrict good faith research—auditors fear that releasing findings or conducting research could lead to their accounts being suspended, ending their ability to do such research, or even lawsuits for violating the terms of service. Already, in the course of conducting good faith research, researchers’ accounts have been suspended without warning, justification, or an opportunity to appeal (Marcus & Southen, 2024). While some companies authorize selected research through researcher access programs, their community representation remains limited and lacks independence from corporate incentives such as favoritism towards researchers aligned with the company’s values. Together, these observations stoke concerns that generative AI companies could emulate the transparency and accountability challenges with social media platforms—limiting researcher transparency and access can mitigate dangerous headlines, public relations fallout, and lawsuits, but at the expense of public interests (Abdo et al., 2022; DiResta et al., 2022). As a group of researchers whose expertise spans AI red teaming, safety, and evaluation, as well as privacy, security, and the law, we have experienced first hand the negative 2 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming TERMINOLOGY CONTEXT Usage Policy A company’s usage policy dictates what uses of its AI systems are acceptable or unacceptable. Usage policies generally prohibit inputs that elicit a range of undesirable model outputs, beyond what is already illegal. For example, see Anthropic’s Acceptable Use Policy. Terms of Service A company’s terms of service imposes legal rules on users of their services. Violations of the usage policy are violations of the terms of service and can be enforced by terminating accounts or taking legal action. Generative AI Evaluation & Red Teaming In security fields, a red team refers to a group authorized to emulate an adversary’s attack against an organization’s security systems. This term has been adopted by the AI community to instead describe penetration testing of a broader set of system flaws than traditional security (The Hacking Policy Council, 2023). In this context, we are referring to testing of released systems by third party ethical hackers, who may or may have explicit consent. Safe Harbor A safe harbor is a measure to provide legal protection to hackers engaged in “good faith” research, abiding by pre-agreed rules of engagement, or vulnerability disclosure policy (e.g. HackerOne (2023)). Good Faith Research “Good faith security research means accessing a computer solely for purposes of good-faith testing, investigation, and/or correction of a security flaw or vulnerability, where such activity is carried out in a manner designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public, and where the information derived from the activity is used primarily to promote security or safety...” (Department of Justice, 2022). We generalize this definition to research beyond security, including soliciting any unwanted behavior in the AI system normally disallowed by the company’s usage policy, which we broadly refer to as “safety research” in this work. Vulnerability Disclosure Policy A vulnerability disclosure policy establishes rules of engagement for third party ethical hackers. This includes disclosure requirements for discovered vulnerabilities, but also other mandatory protocols (Bugcrowd, 2023). Chilling Effects Chilling effects describe the inhibition or discouragement of important research, in this case due to a lack of legal and technical protections, as well as uncertain norms around AI evaluation and red teaming. Table 1. We define and contextualize the technical terminology used in this work, which is often used in other disciplines. effects of legal uncertainty and technical barriers to conducting important research (Table 2). To improve the status quo, we propose that generative AI companies commit to two protections for independent public interest research. First, AI companies should provide a legal safe harbor by offering legal protections for good faith research, provided it is conducted in line with vulnerability disclosure policies (as defined in Table 1). Second, companies should provide a technical safe harbor, protecting safety researchers from having their accounts subject to moderation or suspension. These are fundamental access requirements for inclusive evaluation of generative AI systems. Building on prior work for algorithmic bug bounties (Elazari, 2018a; Kenway et al., 2022; Raji et al., 2022) and social media data access (Abdo et al., 2022), we recommend ways to implement these protections for independent AI evaluation without undermining the processes that prevent model misuse. Specifically we propose that companies delegate account authorization to trusted universities or nonprofits, or provide transparent recourse for accounts suspended in the course of research. These voluntary commitments align with the stated goals of AI companies: to support wider participation in AI safety research, minimize corporate favoritism, and encourage community safety evaluations (see Appendix D). We hope generative AI companies will adopt these commitments to establish better community norms, improve trust in their services, and bolster much needed AI safety in proprietary systems. 2. Background & Motivations Widely used online platforms can have significant socioeconomic impact (Zuboff, 2023; Horwitz et al., 2021). In this section we highlight three reasons to motivate new protections for independent research into generative AI platforms: 1. Social media research has been burdened by a lack of transparency and access, with a rise in legal repercussions for journalism and academic research (Abdo et al., 2022; DeLong, 2021; Belanger, 2023). 2. There is growing concern that widespread risks of generative AI will impact a wider swathe of society. Fostering wider participation in AI evaluation will require commitments to remove disincentives, obstacles, and favoritism in researcher access. 3. Independent AI evaluation is increasingly vital to fair assessments of AI risks, and informed policy debates. We expand on each of these below, using terminology we define in Table 1. 2.1. Avoiding the Fate of Social Media Platforms Prominent social media platforms block researcher access to the detriment of public interests. Civil societies and researchers argue that social media companies have systematically limited researcher access to their platforms, restricting journalism and creating a chilling effect on critical public interest research (DiResta et al., 2022; Mozilla, 3 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming 2023; Boyd et al., 2021; Persily, 2021). Specifically, platforms wield their terms of service to gatekeep access to publicly posted data and limit negative public exposure from independent research. Abdo et al. (2022) argue for “a safe harbor for platform research,” which would include legal provisions that protect researchers and journalists. In the absence of such provisions, researchers have reported platform gatekeeping, account suspensions, cease-and-desist letters and general fears of liability in the course of public interest research, which have resulted in chilling effects (DeLong, 2021; Barclay, 2021; Belanger, 2023). The computer and internet security fields have also seen contentious legal threats and lawsuits against academics (Greene, 2001; Brodkin, 2021; dis, 2021), resulting in new guidelines from the United States Department of Justice that “good-faith security research should not be charged” (Department of Justice, 2022). Companies building generative AI models have the opportunity to protect good faith research before harm from their systems becomes as widespread as that from social media. Conducting research on generative AI comes with additional challenges compared to social media. Compared to past digital technologies, prominent models require accounts to be used (unlike search engines), and their outputs are not publicly visible (unlike posts on many social media platforms) (Narayanan & Kapoor, 2023b). These factors provide developers with comparatively greater control over who accesses their systems, which could exacerbate gatekeeping. The lack of transparency from top developers compounds this issue, with little information available about how and where generative AI systems are used, and to what end (Bommasani et al., 2023b). For external researchers, the models themselves are also black boxes, as developers often do not disclose model architectures, sizes, or training data. This limits independent research to evaluate the risks, capabilities, safety, and societal impact of generative AI (Casper et al., 2024). 2.2. The Importance of Independent AI Evaluation Concerns over the risks and harms of generative AI are mounting. Today, AI systems like ChatGPT have amassed over 100 million weekly users (Hu, 2023), exceeding the growth rate of social media platforms. Generative AI systems have already exhibited “unsafe” behavior—generating highly undesirable and even illegal content—attracting regulatory attention as a result. More specifically, generative AI systems can generate toxic content (Deshpande et al., 2023), libel, hate speech (Douglas Heaven, 2020), and privacy leaks (Carlini et al., 2021; 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2023b; Nasr et al., 2023). They have also been used to scale disinformation (Burtell & Woodside, 2023), fraud (Stupp, 2019; Commission, 2023), malicious tool usage (Li et al., 2023b; Pa Pa et al., 2023; Renaud et al., 2023), copyright infringement (Henderson et al., 2023; Gil et al., 2023; Jonathan, 2023; Shi et al., 2024; Longpre et al., 2023), non-consensual intimate imagery (Lakatos, 2023), and child sexual abuse material (Thiel et al., 2023), as well as provide instructions for self-harm (Park et al., 2023; Xiang, 2023), acquiring weapons (Boiko et al., 2023; Nelson & Rose, 2023), and building weapons of mass destruction (Urbina et al., 2022; Soice et al., 2023). At the extreme end, even CEOs of AI model developers have speculated generative AI will upend labor markets (Suleyman & Bhaskar, 2023) and even pose more severe risks (Barrabi, 2023; Hendrycks et al., 2023). These wide ranging concerns, from the developers themselves, motivate the need for protected independent access. Independent AI evaluation and red teaming are crucial for uncovering vulnerabilities, before they proliferate. Independent researchers often evaluate or “red team” AI systems for a broad range of risks. “Red teaming”, a subset of evaluation, has been adopted by the AI community as a term of art to describe these evaluations aimed at uncovering pernicious system flaws. In this work, we refer specifically to red teaming of publicly released AI systems (rather than pre-release testing), by external researchers, rather than internal teams. Some companies do also provide internal or by-invitation pre-release red teaming, e.g. OpenAI. While all types of testing are critical, external evaluation of AI systems that are already deployed is widely regarded as essential for ensuring safety, security, and accountability (Kenway et al., 2022; Anderljung et al., 2023; ?). Post-release, external red-teaming research has uncovered vulnerabilities related to low resource languages (Yong et al., 2023), conjugate prompting attacks (Kotha et al., 2023), adversarial prompts (Maus et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Robey et al., 2023), generation exploitation attacks (Huang et al., 2023a), persuasion attacks (Xu et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024), a wide range of jailbreaks (Wei et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023), text-toimage vulnerabilities (Parrish et al., 2023), automatic red teaming (Ge et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024), and undetectable methods for fine-tuning away safety mitigations within the platform APIs (Qi et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). See Appendix E for additional examples. These works illustrate how such research benefits AI companies: the research community assists in-house research teams by uncovering vulnerabilities, sharing findings and data, before systems cause major harm. Independent AI evaluation provides impartial perspectives, that are necessary for informed regulation. As the above examples have shown, independent research has uncovered unexpected flaws, aiding company efforts, and expanding the collective knowledge around both vulnerabilities and defenses. These findings have informed the policy and regulatory discussions, including around the types of 4 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming THEME OBSERVATIONS Chilling Effect on Research Safety research can result in companies suspending researcher access, citing terms of service violations. This can have broad chilling effects as access is critical for the other work conducted by these researchers. Many researchers only begin their work after observing first-movers, and scope their practices to emulate those precedents. As a result, vital safety research may be delayed or circumscribed due to uncertainty and caution over account moderation outcomes. Chilling Effect on Vulnerability Disclosure It is unclear whether and how researchers should publicly release their findings, methods or the exploits themselves. In the absence of explicit guidance, they may be too broad or too limited in how they share their results, to the detriment of the community—for instance, by only sharing findings with a small group of other researchers, such as close personal contacts. When researchers are overly cautious in sharing their work it frequently results in siloed research that is less reproducible, or delayed disclosure, especially around the most sensitive findings, which could be to the detriment of public awareness. Incentives to Tackle the Wrong Problems There is an incentive to prioritize less important risks as the focus of safety work both for the uncertainty of repercussions from the companies or community. For instance, researchers might choose to investigate more benign prompt attacks rather than more offensive or dangerous attacks, such as focusing on text rather than more evocative visual outputs, or tool usage. Favoritism and Imbalanced Representation Admission into researcher access programs and favorable responses to safety work can be dependent on connections to the companies. For instance, there is a strong impression that access to OpenAI employees improves access to their programs. External researchers who are not already well connected may not hear back at all from their applications or receive any justification for rejection, as no obligation currently exists on the part of AI companies. Part of this may be due to companies being backlogged with applications from researchers, having dedicated few resources to this task. Costanza-Chock et al. (2022) point out the problems introduced by imbalanced auditor representation. Unclear & Undefined Norms Impressions of basic norms and expectations vary widely, including with respect to appropriate threat models, whether and when to notify companies in advance of publication, what forms of red teaming are acceptable, and whether to release findings, methods, or prompts at all, or how to do so responsibly. Additionally, the type of API access, moderation policies, disclosure processes, and even the likelihood of response to a disclosure vary dramatically by company, leaving researchers without well-defined protocols that would enable them to confidently conduct important safety and security work. A Choice Between Open and Closed Access Researchers prefer to red team deployed systems that have millions of users and therefore pose immediate risks. However, effective and rigorous research requires deep access to the model (Casper et al., 2024), which proprietary systems rarely provide. As Friedler et al. (2023) have noted, “for red-teaming conducted by external groups to be effective, those groups must have full and transparent access to the system in question.” In particular, researchers often require finer-grained access to internal model representations (e.g. “logits”), access to both the base and aligned model, and continual access to a static model, without its API changing or becoming deprecated. Additionally, the underlying source of moderation in closed systems is difficult to diagnose: did the moderation endpoint catch an inappropriate user input, did the model itself abstain from answering, or did the user interface curtail an inappropriate response? Table 2. Themes and observations attributed to informal discussions among authors and colleagues working on AI evaluation and red teaming. We describe the main challenges to conducting rigorous evaluations of widely used generative AI systems. model vulnerabilities, and their comparative safety of open and closed foundation models (Narayanan & Kapoor, 2023a; Lambert, 2023). However, as we shall see, it isn’t clear that we are seeing the full benefits from a thriving red teaming ecosystem (Section 3). Without robust independent evaluation, companies’ own developer safety teams may not be sufficiently large or diverse to fully represent the diversity of global users their products already serve, and the scale of risks they have acknowledged (Costanza-Chock et al., 2022). While companies do invite third-party evaluators, there are well known conflicts of interest without independence in the auditor selection process (Moore et al., 2006). As the Ada Lovelace Institute and another dozen civil societies remarked at the recent AI Safety Summit in the UK, “Companies cannot be allowed to assign and mark their own homework. Any research efforts designed to inform policy action around AI must be conducted with unambiguous independence from industry influence” (Ada Lovelace Institute, 2023). 3. Challenges to Independent AI Evaluation We first discuss the mixed incentives and uncertainty faced by red teaming researchers, followed by analysis of the existing researcher protections, access programs, and their limitations. AI Companies’ Terms of Service discourage communityled evaluations. Many of the findings from the model vulnerability research mentioned in Section 2.2, such as jailbreaks, bypassing safety guardrails, or text-to-image exploits, are legally prohibited by the terms of service for popular systems, including those of OpenAI, Google, An- 5 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming thropic, Inflection, Meta, Midjourney, and others. While these terms are intended as a deterrent against malicious actors, they also inadvertently restrict safety and trustworthiness research—both by forbidding the research, and enforcing it with account suspensions. While platforms enforce these restrictions to varying degrees, the terms disincentivize good faith research by granting developers the right to terminate researchers’ accounts (without appeal or justification) or even take legal action against them. The risk of losing account access may dissuade many researchers altogether, as these accounts are critical for a range of vulnerability and other AI research. AI developers’ documentation often purports to support independent research; however, it does not clearly state the conditions under which evaluation and red teaming would not violate the usage policy, leaving researchers uncertain as to whether or how they should conduct their research. In Table 2, we share common themes attributed to discussions between ourselves and colleagues, summarizing their experiences conducting evaluation and red teaming research on generative AI platforms. These themes reflect an imperfect sample: they are skewed in that they represent the opinions of researchers who chose to conduct safety research, excluding those who chose not to, lacked access to the companies they would have evaluated, or were deterred for uncertainty of legal liability. Independent AI evaluation is largely inconsistent, opaque, and challenging across companies. From our experience and discussions, the bulk of this research is concentrated on Meta models like Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), or OpenAI models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a). Llama models are popular as they have downloadable weights, allowing a researcher to red team locally without having their account terminated for usage policy violations. OpenAI models are popular as they are accessible via API, are highly performant, and have widespread public use. While many researchers are tentative about red teaming OpenAI, usage policy enforcement is often lax. However, account suspensions in the course of public interest research have taken place, to our knowledge, for each of OpenAI, Anthropic, Inflection, and Midjourney, with Midjourney being the most prolific. We withhold details on most of these to respect the anonymity of researchers. As one example, independent evaluation by an artist found Midjourney has a “visual plagiarism problem” (Marcus & Southen, 2024). This resulted in their account being repeatedly suspended without warnings or justification. The cost of suspensions without refunds quickly tallies to hundreds of dollars, and creating new accounts is also not trivial, with blanket bans on credit cards and email addresses. AI companies have begun using their terms of service to deter analysis, particularly into copyright claims. Midjourney updated its Terms of Service to include penalties such as account suspension or legal action for conducting such research.1 Midjourney’s Terms of Service states: “If You knowingly infringe someone else’s intellectual property, and that costs us money, we’re going to come find You and collect that money from You. We might also do other stuff, like try to get a court to make You pay our legal fees. Don’t do it” (Midjourney, 2023).2 Llama 2’s license will also terminate access if model outputs are used as part of intellectual property litigation.3 Our analysis of company policies in Table 3 shows not all companies disclose their enforcement process (the mechanisms for identifying and enforcing violations of the usage policy). Google and Inflection are the only companies to provide the user any form of justification on how the usage policy is enforced. And, only for OpenAI, Inflection, and Midjourney did we find evidence of an enforcement appeals process. Without additional information on how companies enforce their policies, researchers have no insight into enforcement appeals criteria, or whether companies reinstate public interest research post-hoc. Existing safe harbors protect security research but not other good faith research. AI developers have engaged to differing degrees with external red teamers and evaluators. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Meta, for example, have bug bounties, and even safe harbors. However, companies like Meta and Anthropic currently “reserve final and sole discretion for whether you are acting in good faith and in accordance with this Policy”. They may revoke access rights to models, even open models like Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023), or hold the researchers legally accountable, at their discretion. This leaves clear ways to stifle and deter good faith research. Additionally, these safe harbors are tightly-scoped to traditional security issues like unauthorized account access.4 Developers disallow other model flaws named in their usage policies, including, “adversarial testing” (Anthropic, 2023), “jailbreaks”, bypassing safety guardrails, or generating hate speech, misinformation, or abusive imagery. Among other safety research commitments, some companies publish reports on internal evaluation efforts, while others selectively invite third parties to participate in prerelease red teaming, or have researcher access programs for 1 See https://twitter.com/Rahll/status/ 1739155446726791470 2 See Section 10 https://docs.midjourney.com/ docs/terms-of-service 3 See Section 5c: https://ai.meta.com/llama/ license/ 4OpenAI expanded its safe harbor to include “model vulnerability research” and “academic model safety research” in response to an early draft of our proposal, though some ambiguity remains as to the scope of protected activities. 6 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming AI Company AI System Public API / Open Deep Access Researcher Access Bug Bounty Safe Harbor Enforcement Process Enforcement Justification Enforcement Appeal OpenAI GPT-4 H# H#† # H# Google Gemini # # # # H# # Anthropic Claude 2 # # H# # H#‡ # # Inflection Inflection-1 # # # # # # H# H# Meta Llama 2 H#‡ # # # Midjourney Midjourney v6 # # # # # # # H# Cohere Command # # H# # # # Table 3.

The latter was added by OpenAI in response to reading an early draft of this proposal, though some ambiguity remains as to the scope of protected activities. Full details are provided in Table A1. deeper access to released models. These are laudable initiatives, especially when they are accompanied by subsidized credits for researchers (OpenAI, 2024). Nonetheless, these measures leave significant gaps in the ecosystem for independent evaluations. Reports on internal red teaming are often largely irreproducible and generate limited trust due to mismatched corporate incentives (e.g. Anthropic (2023b)). Invitations to third-party researchers are limited and can be self-selecting. And researcher access programs, if available, often do not notify researchers of rejections and thus create an environment of uncertainty (Bommasani et al., 2023b). Researchers have argued that a patchwork of policies like these can create a veneer of open and responsible research, without lifting other obstacles for participatory research (Krawiec, 2003; Zalnieriute, 2021; Whittaker, 2021). Companies should take steps to facilitate independent AI evaluation and reduce the fear of reprisals for safety research. The gaps in the policy architectures of leading AI companies, depicted in Table 3 force well-intentioned researchers to either wait for approval from unresponsive access programs, or risk violating company policy and potentially losing access to their accounts. The net result is a situation akin to companies gatekeeping access to their platforms and thereby restricting the scope of safety research, whether intentional or not. This research environment can limit the diversity and representation in evaluation, ultimately stymieing public awareness of risks to AI safety. 4. Safe Harbors We believe that a pair of voluntary commitments could significantly improve participation, access, and incentives for public interest research into AI safety. The two commitments are: (i) a legal safe harbor, protecting good faith, public interest evaluation research provided it is conducted in accordance with well established security vulnerability disclosure practices, and (ii) a technical safe harbor, protecting this evaluation research from account termination; summarized in Figure 1. Both safe harbors should be scoped to include research activities that uncover any system flaws, including all undesirable generations currently prohibited by the usage policy. As we shall argue later, this would not inhibit existing enforcement against malicious misuse, as protections are entirely contingent on abiding by the law and strict vulnerability disclosure policies, determined ex post. Existing safe harbor resources (Etcovich & van der Merwe, 2018; Pfefferkorn, 2022; HackerOne, 2023), and vulnerability disclosure policies (Blog, 2010; Bugcrowd, 2023) provide grounding for these proposals. In particular, Elazari (2018b; 2019); Akgul et al. (2023); Kenway et al. (2022) discuss the implementations of algorithmic bug bounties, Walshe & Simpson (2023) note ambiguities on formal constraints, and Raji et al. (2022) explore governance for third-party AI audits, including legal protections for researchers. The legal safe harbor, similar to the proposal by Abdo et al. (2022) for social media platforms, would safeguard certain research from some amount of legal liability, mitigating the deterrent of strict terms of service and the threat that researchers’ actions could spark legal action by companies (e.g. under US laws such as the CFAA or DMCA 7 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming Section 1201). The most important condition of a legal safe harbor is the determination of acting in good faith should not be “at the sole discretion” of the companies, as Meta and Anthropic have currently defined it. The technical safe harbor would limit the practical barriers erected by usage policy enforcement, with consistent and broader community access for important, public interest research. Together these steps would reduce the legal and practical obstacles to conducting independent evaluation and red teaming research. 4.1. A Legal Safe Harbor A legal safe harbor could mitigate risks from civil litigation, providing assurances that AI platforms will not sue researchers if their actions were taken for research purposes. Take, for example, the U.S. legal regime, which governs many of the world’s leading AI developers. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which allows for civil lawsuits for accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access (CFAA, 1986), could be used by AI developers to sue researchers for accessing their models in a way that was unintended, though there are complexities to the legal analysis for adversarial attacks on AI models (Evtimov et al., 2019). Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) allows for civil lawsuits if researchers circumvent technological protection measures (TPMs), which effectively control access to works protected by copyright (DMCA, 1998a). These risks are not theoretical; security researchers have been targeted under the CFAA (Pfefferkorn, 2021), and DMCA § 1201 hampered security researchers to the extent that they requested a DMCA exemption for this purpose (Colannino, 2021). Already, in the context of generative AI, OpenAI has attempted to dismiss the New York Times v OpenAI lawsuit (Grynbaum & Mac, 2023) on the allegation that New York Times research into the model constituted hacking (Brittain, 2024). Relatedly, a petition for an exemption to the DMCA has been filed requesting that researchers be allowed to investigate bias in generative AI systems (Weiss, 2023). Abdo et al. (2022) argue a safe harbor is oriented around conditions of access, rather than who gets access. The protections apply only to parties who abide by the rules of engagement, to the extent they can subsequently justify their actions in court. Typically, responsible vulnerability disclosure policies impose strict criteria for when the vulnerability should be disclosed, how long before it can be released to the public, privacy protection rules, and other criteria for the most dangerous exploits. Research that strays from those reasonable measures, or is already illegal, would not succeed in claiming those protections in an ex post investigation. As such, malicious use would remain legally deterred, and platforms would still be obligated to prevent misuse. Abdo et al. (2022) argue a safe harbor designed in this way, based on ex post researcher conduct, would not enable malicious use any more than in its absence. Nor would it alter platforms’ obligations to protect their users against third parties or from enforcing malpractice. Companies’ legal safe harbors would protect researchers from civil liability, not criminal liability. Knowingly querying a model to generate certain types of content, whether for red teaming or not, can be illegal in certain jurisdictions— particularly in the case of image- or video-generation systems (Gupta, 2024). Moreover, certain violations of DMCA § 1201, particularly those that are committed “willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain,” can lead to criminal liability (DMCA, 1998b), as can many violations of the CFAA. We would recommend governments provide clear guidelines and, where appropriate, safe harbors for safe and responsible red teaming of illegal content generated by models. Such safe harbors against criminal conduct may need to be codified into statute in order to be guaranteed. However, they could be implemented by statements of policy, for example, such as when the Department of Justice issued a new policy in 2022 stating that “good-faith security research should not be charged” (Department of Justice, 2022). The US Executive Order on AI directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish guidelines for conducting red-teaming and assessing the safety of foundation models (Executive Office of the President, 2023). Standardizing a legal safe harbor for researchers would complement NIST’s comprehensive AI evaluation agenda and its AI Risk Management Framework (NIST, 2024; Tabassi, 2023). The US AI Safety Institute Consortium, a publicprivate research collaboration, could be used to promote the adoption of safe harbors among companies (NIST, 2023). 4.2. A Technical Safe Harbor Legal safe harbors still do not prevent account suspensions or other enforcement action that would impede independent safety and trustworthiness evaluations. Without sufficient technical protections for public interest research, a mismatch can develop between malicious and non-malicious actors since the latter are discouraged from investigating vulnerabilities exploited by the former. We propose companies offer some path to eliminate these technical barriers for good faith research. This would include more equitable opportunities for researcher access, and guarantees that those opportunities will not be foreclosed for researchers who adhere to companies’ guidelines. The challenge with implementing a technical safe harbor is distinguishing between legitimate research and malicious actors, without notable costs to developers. An exemption to usage moderation may need to be reviewed in advance, or at least when an unfair account suspension occurs. However, we believe this problem is tractable, and offer recommen- 8 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming Company Commitment: Legal Safe Harbor Commitment – We will not threaten or bring any legal action against anyone conducting good faith research who complies with the rules of engagement set out in our vulnerability disclosure policy. As long as you comply with our policy: ❖ We will not make any claim under the DMCA, for circumventing technological measures to protect the services eligible under this policy. ❖ We consider your security research to be \\"authorized\\" under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (and/or similar state laws). ❖ We waive any restrictions in our applicable Terms of Use and Usage Policies that would prohibit your participation in this policy, but only for the limited purpose of your model research under this policy. ❖ We will take steps to make known that you conducted good faith research if someone else brings legal action against you. Company Commitment: Technical Safe Harbor Commitment – We will make all reasonable efforts to not penalize user accounts engaged in good faith research into our systems, as long as they comply with the rules of engagement set out in our vulnerability disclosure policy. ❖ We shall not limit research on the basis that it may be against the interests of our company. ❖ We shall offer a research access program that involves independent, transparent, and timely review into research proposals. ❖ We shall offer a transparent appeals and review process if an account is restricted for alleged misuse (e.g. account suspension). ❖ We shall reinstate researchers’ accounts in the event that of good faith research initiatives are found to have been penalized. Good Faith Researcher Commitments Scope of Research – Investigation into behavior of the AI system, including those disallowed by the acceptable usage policy. Researcher Responsibilities – All responsibilities, such as those already encoded in a company’s Rules of Engagement for security research continue to apply. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to: ❖ In-scope: Test only in-scope systems and respect out-of-scope systems. ❖ Vulnerability disclosure: Promptly report discovered vulnerabilities. Keep vulnerability details confidential if releasing them violates the law, or until a pre-agreed period of time after the vulnerability is reported (usually 90 days). ❖ Harms to users and systems: Refrain from violating privacy, disrupting systems, destroying data, or harming user experience. ❖ Privacy requirements: Do not intentionally access, modify, or use data belonging to others, including confidential data. If a vulnerability exposes such data, stop testing, submit a report immediately, and delete all copies of the information. Figure 1. A summary of the suggested mutual commitments and scope of a legal safe harbor, and technical safe harbor. These commitments extend existing safe harbors for security research as well as researcher access programs, and are written in the context of US laws. For a wider list of common researcher responsibilities consider OpenAI’s Rules of Engagement. dations, grounded in prior proposals. First, we discuss how to scale up participation by delegating responsibilities to trusted independent third parties to pre-review researcher access. Then we discuss how an independently reviewed and transparent account suspension appeals process could enable fairer post-review to researcher access. Independent review and scaling participation are staples of both options. Independent third parties like universities or NAIRR can scale participation in AI evaluation, without misaligned corporate incentives. To facilitate more equitable access, and reduce the potential for corporate favoritism, we propose the responsibility of access authorization be delegated to trusted third parties, such as universities, government, or civil society organizations. The U.S. National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) offers a suitable vehicle for a pilot of this approach as it already partners with and shares resources between AI developers and nonprofits. AI developers provide resource credits through NAIRR, and OpenAI has called for wider participation: “by providing broader access to essential tools and data, we are opening doors for a diverse range of talents and ideas, furthering innovation and ensuring that AI development continues to be a force for the greater good” (National Science Foundation, 2024). A similar approach has already been adopted to provide independent access to Meta’s social media user data, with the University of Michigan as the trusted intermediary (Gonzalez-Bail ´ on et al. ´ , 2023). This solution scales, with partner organizations likely to aid in access review in exchange for wider participation in AI red teaming. It also effectively diverts responsibility from corporate interests to organizations already invested in fair, responsible, and accountable AI research. These partnerships do not require AI developers to fully relinquish access control but are a meaningful step in facilitating more equitable access without stretching their own resources. Each partner organization’s API usage could be traced to their API keys—essentially a “researcher API”. Organizations would have autonomy to authorize their own network of researchers, but would be responsible for any misuse tied to their API keys. A number of similar proposals, discussed in Section 5, have been made for independent researcher access, like structured access or review boards, both of which would delegate the responsibility of access selection to independent third 9 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming parties. While this approach scales well and adopts independent access privileges, it can have severe limitations if AI companies only select a very finite set of partners, or choose to exclude more critical organizations. As a start, we recommend allowing NAIRR to help formulate the partner network, to include a set of trusted international academic organizations, as well as nonprofits in NAIRR such as AI2, EleutherAI, and MLCommons. Already these changes would make significant strides in expanding access through independent review. Transparent access and appeals processes can improve community trust. Some generative AI companies may be unwilling to share access authorization more widely. There is a clear alternative: commit to a transparent access appeals process that makes decision criteria and outcomes visible to the wider community. Ideally, this process would be reviewed independently, perhaps with the help of NAIRR partner organizations. Whenever public interest evaluation research is suspended, researchers should have the opportunity to appeal the decision under a technical safe harbor. Companies can adopt an access process with clearly codified selection criteria, guaranteeing they will respond to applicants within a certain period of time, with a justification for the outcome decision. While this would not address the need for additional resources, it would provide the AI community with significantly greater visibility into companies’ decisions to grant access, and allow the community to apply collective pressure against any attempt to restrict legitimate research. The common denominator between pre-review and post-review technical safe harbors, described above, is providing a fair process to enable good faith research without the fear of unjustified account suspensions. In Appendix C we sketch an implementation of a pre-registration and appeals process, based on existing researcher access programs, that could facilitate implementation of a technical safe harbor. There are many dimensions of improving researcher access, including earlier access, deeper access, and subsidized access. The technical safe harbor described is a precondition for more independent and broader participation across all these axes, should companies offer earlier, deeper, or subsizided access. While efforts by AI companies to broaden safety research, such as accepting community applications for pre-release red-teaming and subsidizing such research with compute credits are useful first steps, the safe harbors we propose would strengthen broader research protections while being more independent of AI companies’ control. 5. Related Proposals Our proposals for legal and technical safe harbors build on prior calls to expand independent access for AI evaluation, red teaming, and safety research. The Hacking Policy Council (2023) has proposed that governments “clarify and extend legal protections for independent AI red teaming,” similar to our voluntary legal safe harbor proposal. The Council stated, “the same industry norms on providing time to mitigate before public disclosure, and avoiding retaliation for good faith disclosures, should eventually apply to AI misalignment disclosures as they do for security vulnerability disclosures.” The Algorithmic Justice League has advocated for vulnerability disclosure for algorithmic harms, calling for independent algorithmic audits involving impacted communities (Costanza-Chock et al., 2022; Kenway et al., 2022). Moreover, AI Village hosts events where large groups of independent researchers red team generative AI models for a wide range of vulnerabilities (Sven Cattell, 2023). An array of researchers have recommended additional external scrutiny of the emerging risks and overall safety of frontier AI models to “improve assessment rigor and foster accountability to the public interest” (Anderljung et al., 2023). Bucknall & Trager (2023) have also proposed structured access for third party research via a dedicated research access API, with third-party independent review. Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundation Models has proposed an independent Foundation Models Review Board to moderate and review requests for deeper researcher access to foundation models (Liang et al., 2022). Governments have also suggested the need for independent evaluation and red teaming. The US Office of Management and Budget’s Proposed Memorandum on Advancing Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management for Agency Use of Artificial Intelligence encourages federal agencies to consider as part of procurement contracts for generative AI systems “requiring adequate testing and safeguards, including external AI red teaming, against risks from generative AI such as discriminatory, misleading, inflammatory, unsafe, or deceptive outputs” (United States Office of Management and Budget, 2023). The EU AI Act states that providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks must share a “detailed description of the measures put in place for the purpose of conducting internal and/or external adversarial testing (e.g. red teaming), model adaptations, including alignment and fine-tuning” to the EU as part of their technical documentation (European Council, 2024; Hacker, 2023). In addition, Canada’s Voluntary Code of Conduct on the Responsible Development and Management of Advanced Generative AI Systems includes a commitment that developers will “conduc[t] third-party audits prior to release” (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, 2023). 6. Conclusion The need for independent AI evaluation has garnered significant support from academics, journalists, and civil society. 10 · A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming Examining challenges to external evaluation of generative AI systems, we identify legal and technical safe harbors as minimum and fundamental protections. We believe they would significantly improve norms in the ecosystem and drive more inclusive community efforts to tackle the risks of generative AI","output":"This article discusses the challenges and necessity of conducting independent evaluation and red-teaming of generative AI systems to identify risks and vulnerabilities. The authors argue that the terms of service and enforcement strategies of major AI companies create disincentives for good faith safety research, leading to a chilling effect where researchers fear account suspensions and legal reprisal for their work. The article proposes two main solutions: 1. Legal Safe Harbor: AI companies should commit to providing legal protections for good faith research that complies with established rules of engagement, safeguarding researchers from civil litigation risks under laws like the CFAA and DMCA. 2. Technical Safe Harbor: AI companies should ensure that good faith research is not penalized through account moderation or suspension. This includes implementing transparent access and appeals processes for researchers and potentially delegating access authorization to trusted third parties like universities or nonprofit organizations. The authors emphasize that these proposals are essential for fostering a more inclusive and unimpeded effort by the community to address the risks associated with generative AI. They highlight the current policies and practices among major AI companies, pointing out the limitations in transparency, access, and support for independent AI evaluation. To substantiate the need for such reforms, the article mentions a range of potential risks and misuses of generative AI, including bias, hate speech, privacy concerns, disinformation, self-harm, copyright infringement, fraud, and the generation of harmful content. The article also addresses the social media precedent, where limited researcher access has burdened the evaluation of platform impact on society. It calls for similar protections for AI evaluation to prevent generative AI companies from following a similar path of limited transparency and access. Ultimately, the authors suggest that the commitment to safe harbors would align with the stated goals of AI companies to support AI safety research, minimize corporate favoritism, and encourage community safety evaluations. They call on generative AI companies to adopt these commitments to establish better community norms, improve trust in their services, and bolster AI safety."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

The phrase you might have heard could be a misinterpretation of the real reasons behind their low cancer rates. The primary reason elephants are less prone to cancer is believed to be due to their multiple copies of a tumor suppressor gene called TP53. Humans have only one copy of the TP53 gene, while elephants have 20 copies. This gene is responsible for repairing damaged DNA and initiating cell death when DNA damage is irreparable, thus preventing the proliferation of potential cancer cells. This phenomenon is known as Peto's Paradox, which observes that while larger animals have more cells and longer lifespans (and thus, theoretically, a higher chance of cancerous mutations), they do not exhibit higher rates of cancer than species with fewer cells. Elephants are one of the best examples of this paradox. Further research into elephant biology may help us understand better ways to prevent and treat cancer in humans. However, the notion that elephants get \\"cancer within a cancer\\" is not accurate according to current scientific understanding."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

回転: 正方形は0°（無操作）、90°、180°、270°の回転で図形を不変に保つことができ、これらの操作は対称群に含まれます。 - 反射: 正方形には4本の対称軸が存在し、それらの軸に関して図形を反転させるともとの図形と重なります。 これらの対称操作全てを組み合わせることで、正方形の対称群（具体的にはDih_4群）が構成されます。群の要素はこれらの操作を表すものであり、一つ一つの操作を群の元として考えます。そして、これらの元の間の「演算」は、一方の操作を行った後に別の操作を行うという、操作の連続を意味します。 このように、群論を用いることで、図形や立体の対称性を数学的に整理し、その構造を深く理解することが可能になります。"},{"instruction":"この場合の集合と演算は何になりますか？","output":"この文脈における「集合」とは、特定の対象（例えば平面図形や立体）に対する全ての可能な対称操作（回転、反射など）の集まりを指します。それに対して「演算」とは、これらの操作を組み合わせるという数学的なプロセスです。どちらの操作を行った後に行うかに依存する合成演算として理解されます。 平面上の正方形の対称性を例に考えると： # 集合 (Set) 集合は、正方形に対して行うことができる全ての対称操作です。正方形には以下のような対称操作が存在します： - 回転 - R_0: 0度の回転（恒等写像、つまり元の図形をそのまま置いておく操作） - R_90: 90度の回転 - R_180: 180度の回転 - R_270: 270度の回転 - 反射 - F_H: 水平軸に沿った反射 - F_V: 垂直軸に沿った反射 - F_D: 対角線に沿った反射（2つありますが、それぞれを異なる操作と考える） これらの操作を全部集めて、( {R_0, R_90, R_180, R_270, F_H, F_V, F_D1, F_D2} )の8つの元を持つ集合が、正方形に対する対称操作の集合となります。 # 演算 (Operation) 演算は、上記の対称操作をどのように組み合わせるかを定義します。対称群における演算は、通常、2つの操作を連続して行うことを意味します。たとえば、90度の回転操作R_90を行った後に、水平軸に沿った反射F_Hを行うとします。これらを組み合わせた結果は、元の正方形の別の対称操作と見なすことができ、これも集合の要素の一つです。 数学的には、演算は「合成」として定義され、群が閉じていることを意味します。つまり、任意の2つの元aとbを演算した結果（( a cdot b )）も同じ集合の一つの元となります。この条件は、群の公理の一つです。 これらの性質を持つ集合と演算により、正方形の対称性は群という数学的構造によって完全に記述されます。この群は各要素（操作）が他の要素と組み合わされる方法を規定することで、図形の対称性という本質的な性質を捉えることができるのです。"},{"instruction":"群では「二項間の演算」を「二つの元を引数に取る写像」と読み替えてもんだいないですか？","output":"はい、群の「二項演算」としての操作を「二つの元を引数に取る写像」(関数)と見なすことは全く問題ありません。実際に数学では、群の演算を集合上の関数（写像）として表現することは一般的です。 群 ( G ) における演算を数学的に表現すると、それは次のようなものです： [ cdot : G times G rightarrow G ] この関数は、群 ( G ) の任意の二つの元 ( a, b in G ) を取り、これらを「演算」(( cdot )) によって結合し、別の元 ( c in G ) を生成します。つまり、関数 ( cdot ) は ( c = a cdot b ) を満たします。この場合、( c ) も群 ( G ) の元でなければなりません。これは群が「閉じている」という性質（演算の結果が群の元の中に留まる性質）を捉えています。 これは以下の要件を満たす必要があります： 1. **結合律**：( (a cdot b) cdot c = a cdot (b cdot c) ) すべての ( a, b, c in G ) に対して成立します。 2. **単位元の存在**：ある元 ( e in G ) が存在し、すべての ( a in G ) に対して ( e cdot a = a cdot e = a ) となります。 3. **逆元の存在**：( G ) の任意の元 ( a ) に対して、( a ) の逆元と呼ばれる ( a^{-1} in G ) が存在し、( a cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} cdot a = e ) を満たします。 このような数学的表現を通して、群の操作が厳密で堅牢な構造を持っていることが分かります。なお、群論における「演算」は、日常生活での加算や乗算などの演算と同じように、関数として理解することができ、確かにそれは群の元間のある種の「組み合わせ方」を提供しています。"},{"instruction":"集合に距離を定義すると位相空間になるのですか？","output":"距離を定義することだけでは、集合が位相空間になるわけではありません。位相空間と、距離を備えた空間である距離空間（メトリック空間）は、関連するが異なる概念です。 # 位相空間 (Topological Space) 位相空間は、開集合の概念を通して定義されます。位相空間となるためには、集合 (X) 上に「位相」と呼ばれる開集合系 ( tau ) が定義されている必要があります。位相 ( tau ) は集合 (X) の部分集合の集まりであり、以下の条件を満たす必要があります： 1. 空集合 ( emptyset ) と集合 (X) 自身が開集合である。 2. 任意の開集合の和集合（合併）は開集合である。 3. 任意の開集合の共通部分（積集合）は開集合である（ただし、共通部分は有限個である必要がある）。 # 距離空間 (Metric Space) 一方で、距離空間は集合の各々の二点間に距離（メトリック）を定義することで特徴づけられます。距離空間 ( (X, d) ) において、( d: X times X rightarrow mathbb{R} ) は以下の性質を満たす必要があります： 1. 非負性：( d(x, y) ge 0 )（すべての ( x, y in X ) に対し） 2. 自己同一性：( d(x, y) = 0 ) は ( x = y ) のとき、とだけに成立する。 3. 対称性：( d(x, y) = d(y, x) )（すべての ( x, y in X ) に対し） 4. 三角不等式：( d(x, z) le d(x, y) + d(y, z) )（すべての ( x, y, z in X ) に対し） 距離空間は自然に位相空間と見なすことができます。なぜなら、距離に基づいて定義される開球（各点から一定の距離未満の点の集合）を用いて開集合を形成し、それらが上記の位相空間の定義を満たすからです。しかし、位相空間は距離が定義されていない可能性もあり、位相の概念は距離の概念よりもはるかに一般的で柔軟です。距離を具体的に定義することなく、開集合の概念を通じて点の近さや連続性を扱えます。 要約すると、距離を定義すれば必ず距離空間になりますが、その距離から自然に生じる開集合を用いることで、それは位相空間にもなります。逆に、位相が与えられている集合が距離空間になるとは限らず、位相を用いて距離を回復することができるか否かは位相の選び方に依存します。"},{"instruction":"先ほどの群ではどんな事を研究するの？","output":"群論は数学の中でも非常に広範な分野の一つであり、様々な抽象的な概念や具体的な対象を扱います。群論において研究される対象や問題は多岐にわたり、以下に代表的な例を挙げます。 # 群の構造理論 -

Let's break it down: 1. **Flying Camera**: In 1990, consumer drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cameras were not available. The technology for miniaturized, stabilized cameras that could be mounted on remotely operated flying platforms was still in its nascent stages, and what did exist was primarily for military or specialized industrial applications. Consumer-level camera drones would not become mainstream until decades later. 2. **Computer from 1990**: Personal computers from 1990 were quite limited compared with today's technology. They often featured 8 or 16 MHz processors (like the Intel 80386 or 80486), had megabytes (or even kilobytes) of RAM, and operated with limited storage capacities—measured in megabytes on hard disk drives. Graphics capabilities were also limited, with simple VGA or SVGA displays being common, and internet connectivity was not a standard feature. Combining the two technologies would result in a theoretically possible but highly impractical and likely non-functional device given the era's technological constraints. The idea of managing a flying camera through a computer would require: - Advanced software for controlling the flight of the camera, which was not commonly available at the time. - A communication link between the computer and the camera, which would likely need to be a custom-built radio frequency (RF) transmitter and receiver, as Wi-Fi did not exist then. - A digital camera capable of streaming video back to the computer, which would be challenging since digital cameras were just entering the consumer market and video streaming technology was not yet developed for consumer use. If such a device were to theoretically exist in 1990, it would definitely be a pioneering piece of technology, likely developed within a research institution or by a defense contractor with a substantial budget. It would not have been found in typical consumer settings, and its capabilities would be extremely limited by contemporary standards."},{"instruction":"写一段python代码，将A4纸张的pdf,剪每页中上位置的a5大小到新的pdf","output":"创建新的A5尺寸PDF，从A4 PDF每页中剪切顶部A5大小区域的操作可以使用\`PyPDF2\`库来完成。以下是一个简单的Python脚本例子，用于完成这个任务： \`\`\`python import PyPDF2 from PyPDF2 import PdfFileWriter, PdfFileReader # 定义A4和A5尺寸 A4_WIDTH = 595.275590551181 # A4宽度的点数(points) A4_HEIGHT = 841.8897637795275 # A4高度的点数 A5_WIDTH = A4_WIDTH A5_HEIGHT = A4_HEIGHT / 2 # 创建一个PDF写入器实例 pdf_writer = PdfFileWriter() # 读取原始A4 PDF文件 with open('A4_document.pdf', 'rb') as file: pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file) # 遍历PDF中的每一页 for page_num in range(pdf_reader.numPages): # 获取当前页 page = pdf_reader.getPage(page_num) # 获取页面的mediabox mediabox = page.mediaBox # 设置要剪切的上半部分的矩形区域 page.cropBox.lowerLeft = (mediabox.left, mediabox.top - A5_HEIGHT) page.cropBox.upperRight = (mediabox.right, mediabox.top) # 将裁剪后的页面加入到写入器 pdf_writer.addPage(page) # 将剪裁后的页写入到新的PDF文件 with open('A5_document.pdf', 'wb') as outfile: pdf_writer.write(outfile) print(\\"完成从A4到A5的剪裁。\\") \`\`\` 确保您已经安装了\`PyPDF2\`库，如果还没有安装，可以通过pip安装： \`\`\`sh pip install PyPDF2 \`\`\` 将上述代码保存到一个\`.py\`文件中，并将\`'A4_document.pdf'\`替换成你的PDF文件名，执行脚本，会生成一个名为\`'A5_document.pdf'\`的剪裁后的PDF文件。这个脚本会取每页的上半部分，如果你希望取其他部分，可以相应地调整\`page.cropBox.lowerLeft\`和\`page.cropBox.upperRight\`的值。"},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop\\"","output":"coffee in shop"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee in shop","output":"\\"Coffee In Shop | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Modern Urban Style | Unique Cafe-Themed Decor & Apparel\\""},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While the actual chip is made from silicon and is only a few centimeters wide, a large model would need to dramatically increase the size of all its internal features to make them visible to the naked eye. Here's what you might expect to see: 1. **Die Layout** - You would have a large, flat surface representing the silicon die. On this surface, different regions would be marked to represent the various functional blocks of the CPU. 2. **Cores and Cache** - The 486 was a single-core processor with an onboard cache, so the model would show one large central processing area along with a smaller section designated as cache memory. 3. **Pipelines and ALU** - The model would have to represent the basic pipelining that the 486 had. You'd see a flow diagram showing how instructions move from the fetch stage to the decode stage and then to the execution stage where the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is. 4. **FPU** - If the model is of an i486DX, it would have a section representing the integrated Floating-Point Unit (FPU), which was a significant feature distinguishing it from the less expensive i486SX, which lacked an FPU. 5. **Bus Interface** - There would be representations of the bus interface, showing how the processor communicates with other system components like memory and I/O devices. 6. **Transistors** - The i486 had over a million transistors, so the model would have to represent these in some abstract way, perhaps as a field of pins or small lights, to give the viewer an idea of their density and layout. 7. **Data Paths** - Data paths would be illustrated to show the flow of data within the CPU and how it interacts with both the cache and external buses. 8. **Control Unit** - This would be an area on the die showing where the control logic sits which manages the execution of instructions and the overall coordination among the CPU's components. 9. **Clock Circuitry** - Some representation of the clock generation and distribution mechanism would be crucial, as this is the heartbeat of the processor. 10. **I/O and Voltage Regulators** - Because CPUs also have to manage power and communicate with other components, you’d see areas that manage these functions, though these are less visually distinct. The actual implementation of this model, whether it’s made from plastic, metal, or another material, would need to be interpretative since the real functions on the CPU die occur at an electronic and microscopic level, which is hard to represent physically. It would also be largely symbolic, as representing the behavior and physical layout of a microprocessor at large scale remains a challenge due to the complexity and microscopic nature of modern electronics. To add an educational dimension, such a model could incorporate interactive elements with LEDs, moving parts, or even touch-sensitive areas that light up or activate to visualize how data flows through the processor and how its various units work together to perform computations."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As a Chief Data Officer (CDO) of a rideshare company, creating a Star Schema for a data warehouse is an essential task for enabling efficient data analysis. A Star Schema is a type of database schema that is optimized for query performance in a data warehouse. It consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables that provide context to the data. In the case of a rideshare company, we want to analyze rideshare trips, driver information, vehicle information, customer feedback, pricing, and payments. Here's a conceptual Star Schema designed for rideshare-related products: **Fact Tables**: 1. \`Fact_Trips\` - TripID (PK) - DriverID (FK) - VehicleID (FK) - StartTimeID (FK) - EndTimeID (FK) - PickupLocationID (FK) - DropoffLocationID (FK) - CustomerID (FK) - PricingPlanID (FK) - PaymentID (FK) - MilesTraveled - TripDuration - FareAmount - TipAmount - TotalAmount - RatingID (FK) **Dimension Tables**: 1. \`Dim_Driver\` - DriverID (PK) - DriverName - LicenseNumber - Rating - HomeCityID (FK) 2. \`Dim_Vehicle\` - VehicleID (PK) - VehicleType - Make - Model - Year - LicensePlate 3. \`Dim_Location\` - LocationID (PK) - Address - City - State - ZipCode - Country - Latitude - Longitude 4. \`Dim_Customer\` - CustomerID (PK) - CustomerName - PhoneNumber - Email - HomeCityID (FK) 5. \`Dim_Time\` - TimeID (PK) - Date - Time - Hour - DayOfWeek - Month - Year 6. \`Dim_PricingPlan\` - PricingPlanID (PK) - PlanName - BaseFare - PerMinuteRate - PerMileRate - CancellationFee 7. \`Dim_Payment\` - PaymentID (PK) - PaymentType - PaymentProvider - IsPaymentSuccessful 8. \`Dim_Rating\` - RatingID (PK) - RatingScore - FeedbackComment **Explanation**: - \`Fact_Trips\` is the core of this star schema which captures data about individual rides. The foreign keys (FK) connect to the respective dimension tables for the driver, vehicle, time, location, customer, pricing plan, payment details, and rating given for the ride. - \`Dim_Driver\` and \`Dim_Customer\` might have HomeCityID foreign keys linking to the \`Dim_Location\` table to avoid redundancy and allow for more detailed analysis by geographical demographics. - \`Dim_Time\` can be used for analyzing data by time intervals such as hour, day, week, month, or year. - \`Dim_Location\` is used twice for the pickup and dropoff locations, which provides in-depth insights into travel patterns, popular locations, and area-based demand. - \`Dim_PricingPlan\` holds information about different pricing strategies which can be used to analyze the profitability and popularity of each plan. - \`Dim_Payment\` captures details about the payment mechanisms, which could be helpful for tracking payment success rates and preferred payment methods. - \`Dim_Rating\` captures the feedback ratings from customers to analyze driver performance, and customer satisfaction. By querying this schema, analysts can easily run reports to understand trip durations, earnings, peak times, driver and customer activity, and much more. As designed, the star schema is optimized for reading large volumes of data quickly and supports the analytical queries typically used in business intelligence applications."},{"instruction":"How to measure success for the company to find KPI data?","output":"Measuring success for a rideshare company involves identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) that are critical to the organization's operational, financial, and strategic performance.

Leveraging business intelligence (BI) tools to analyze this collected data will help identify trends, pain points, and opportunities for improvement."},{"instruction":"Good, Can you add metrics that you built into star schema?","output":"Certainly! Let's integrate the identified KPIs and metrics into the Star Schema we discussed earlier. Some metrics can be directly calculated from the fact and dimension tables, while others might require additional data collection efforts or the creation of new dimension tables. Here's how to incorporate the discussed metrics into the existing star schema: # Updated Fact Table: \`Fact_Trips\` could be expanded or supplemented with additional attributes to support the calculation of KPIs: - AccidentIncidentFlag (New attribute to track safety incidents) - ComplianceViolationFlag (New attribute to track compliance issues) - WaitTime (Amount of time the customer waited for the ride to begin) # New Dimension Tables: 1. \`Dim_SafetyIncidents\` - IncidentID (PK) - TripID (FK) - Description - SeverityLevel - ResolutionStatus 2. \`Dim_Compliance\` - ComplianceID (PK) - RegulationCategory - ViolationType - DateReported - ResolutionStatus 3. \`Dim_SupportQueries\` - SupportQueryID (PK) - CustomerID (FK) - IssueType - OpenTime - ResolutionTime 4. \`Dim_DriverEarnings\` - EarningID (PK) - DriverID (FK) - Date - Earnings (This can be broken down into fare, tips, bonuses, etc.) - Deductions - NetEarnings 5. \`Dim_MarketData\` (To be populated with external market research data) - MarketDataID (PK) - MarketArea - TotalMarketRides - TotalMarketRevenue - CompanyMarketShare # Additional Metrics From the Schema: With the dimensional data in the database, you can now calculate the following metrics: - **Customer Satisfaction and Driver Satisfaction Scores**: By using the feedback data in \`Dim_Rating\` and correlates with \`Fact_Trips\`. - **Driver Churn and Retention Rates**: Use a combination of \`Dim_Driver\`, \`Dim_Time\`, and driver activity within \`Fact_Trips\`. - **Service Reliability**: By analyzing the \`Fact_Trips\` along with application logs (this may require an additional fact table or dimension table to track app-related incidents). - **Average Earnings per Driver**: Calculated using \`Dim_DriverEarnings\`. - **Market Share**: Compare \`Fact_Trips\` data against \`Dim_MarketData\` to determine the company’s market share. # Calculations and Reports: To leverage this schema for reporting, you can use SQL queries or business intelligence tools to calculate the KPIs. For example: - **CSAT or NPS Score**: Aggregate customer ratings based on post-ride surveys joined with trip data. - **Average Wait Time**: Calculate the average time from trip request to pickup from the \`WaitTime\` in \`Fact_Trips\`. - **Driver Earnings**: Summarize earnings data from the \`Dim_DriverEarnings\`. - **Market Share**: Aggregate total rides from \`Fact_Trips\` and calculate the percentage of the total rides in the market using \`Dim_MarketData\`. Real-time dashboards can also be designed to provide continuous monitoring of these KPIs. Typically, you would use a mix of batch processing (for historical data) and stream processing (for real-time data) to keep these metrics updated. Each KPI will need a clearly defined SQL query that can transform raw data from these tables into actionable insights, and the star schema makes it easier to write and execute these queries with better performance due to the de-normalized structure that is optimized for read access in data warehouses."},{"instruction":"Can you give create SQL script for above star schema including all metrics?","output":"Creating a full SQL script for a star schema including all metrics would be quite extensive, and there are a few caveats to consider: - The SQL script would only define the structure of the schema and not the actual data or the logic for populating the tables. - The business logic for calculating metrics usually resides in application code or in SQL queries for reporting, rather than in the database schema itself. - Some metrics require additional processes, such as data collection from apps or surveys, which can't be represented in a SQL script for a database schema. However, I can provide you with some sample SQL to create the star schema structure, including fact and dimension tables, which reflect rideshare-related data.

Calculate all the drivers who departed or reached the airport as the destination?","output":"To calculate all the drivers who departed from or reached the airport as the destination, we'll assume the rideshare company has defined specific locations that are labeled as \\"airport\\" in the \`Dim_Location\` table. Let's further assume that we’ve added a flag in the \`Dim_Location\` table to identify whether a location is an airport. First, we'll need to modify the \`Dim_Location\` table to add an \`IsAirport\` flag: \`\`\`sql ALTER TABLE Dim_Location ADD COLUMN IsAirport BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE; \`\`\` To update the \`IsAirport\` flag for airport locations, you would use a query like this: \`\`\`sql UPDATE Dim_Location SET IsAirport = TRUE WHERE Address LIKE '%airport%' OR City LIKE '%airport%'; -- Use appropriate criteria for identifying airport locations \`\`\` After updating the location data, you can count trips that originated or ended at the airport using the following query: \`\`\`sql SELECT DISTINCT d.DriverID, d.DriverName FROM Fact_Trips AS t JOIN Dim_Driver AS d ON t.DriverID = d.DriverID JOIN Dim_Location AS loc ON (t.PickupLocationID = loc.LocationID OR t.DropoffLocationID = loc.LocationID) WHERE loc.IsAirport = TRUE; \`\`\` This query will give you the distinct list of drivers who have either picked up or dropped off passengers at locations marked as airports. Adjust the query as needed to match your specific data and requirements, such as differentiating between pickups and drop-offs if necessary."},{"instruction":"2. Calculate all the customers who only departed or reached the airport as the destination. The customers who have been to other destinations don’t count","output":"To calculate all the customers who only departed from or reached the airport as the destination, and didn't go to any other destinations, you would perform a somewhat complex query. You need to identify customers who had rides to or from the airport location, and then exclude customers who also had rides to or from non-airport locations. Assuming you have already modified the \`Dim_Location\` table to have the \`IsAirport\` Boolean flag as indicated in the previous reply and also updated the airport locations with the respective flag, you can use the following SQL query: \`\`\`sql SELECT DISTINCT t.CustomerID, c.CustomerName FROM Fact_Trips t JOIN Dim_Customer c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID JOIN Dim_Location l_pickup ON t.PickupLocationID = l_pickup.LocationID JOIN Dim_Location l_dropoff ON t.DropoffLocationID = l_dropoff.LocationID WHERE (l_pickup.IsAirport = TRUE OR l_dropoff.IsAirport = TRUE) AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM Fact_Trips t_inner JOIN Dim_Location l_inner ON t_inner.PickupLocationID = l_inner.LocationID OR t_inner.DropoffLocationID = l_inner.LocationID WHERE t_inner.CustomerID = t.CustomerID AND l_inner.IsAirport = FALSE ); \`\`\` This query does a few key things: 1. It selects distinct customers from \`Fact_Trips\` who have either been picked up or dropped off at an airport location (where \`IsAirport = TRUE\`). 2. It uses a \`NOT EXISTS\` subquery to exclude customers who have also had pickups or dropoffs from locations that are not airports (where \`IsAirport = FALSE\`). It's essential to understand that the subquery is correlated—meaning it references \`t.CustomerID\` from the outer query to ensure it's checking rides for the same customer. This query will give you all the customers who had trips strictly to/from the airport and did not have any rides to/from other destinations. Make sure to run the update statement as well to set the \`IsAirport\` flag in \`Dim_Location\`, as indicated in the previous scenario."},{"instruction":"Discuss the parts in the table design that could have been improve","output":"Designing an effective star schema for a data warehouse requires balancing between performance, flexibility, maintainability, and the granularity of the data. Here are some aspects of the table design that could be improved or that would typically require further refinement in a real-world application: 1. **Granularity and Scope of Fact Table**: - The granularity of the \`Fact_Trips\` table is important for analysis. If we're including every ride, regardless of completion, the table might become very large, very fast. We might consider splitting it into multiple fact tables like \`Fact_CompletedTrips\`, \`Fact_CanceledTrips\`, etc., for better performance and manageability. 2. **Dimensional Attributes**: - Instead of only an \`IsAirport\` flag in \`Dim_Location\`, it could be more scalable to have a \`LocationType\` field that allows categorization into multiple location types like Airports, Train Stations, Hotels, etc. This provides more analytical dimensions without creating multiple flags. - \`Dim_Time\` could include more detailed time dimensions such as minute, week, quarter, and isHolidayFlag to allow for deeper temporal analysis. 3. **Handling Changes Over Time (Slowly Changing Dimensions)**: - If the attributes of dimensions change over time (like a driver's rating), the schema must account for these changes. Implementing a slowly changing dimension (SCD) strategy like Type 2 SCD can track historical changes by versioning the records. 4. **Surrogate Keys**: - The use of surrogate keys (typically an auto-incrementing integer) is important for ensuring that each dimension row is unique, even if the natural key changes. This is done correctly in the design, but it's essential to make sure that these keys are indeed used in all referencing fact tables. 5. **Data Types and Precision**: - It's essential to make sure fields like ratings, geolocation, times, and monetary amounts have accurately defined data types with the correct precision to capture the necessary level of detail without wasting storage space. 6. **Normalization**: - While star schemas are typically denormalized for query performance, some normalization may still be beneficial, particularly if there are repeating groups or excessively wide tables. 7. **Dealing with Hierarchies**: - If there are hierarchies within the dimensions (like a geographic region hierarchy or a time hierarchy), separate dimension tables or additional columns to handle these hierarchies could be useful. 8. **Additional Metadata**: - In a production environment, it would be beneficial to include metadata such as createdDate, createdBy, updatedDate, and updatedBy for audit and tracking purposes. 9. **Referential Integrity**: - Enforcing referential integrity through foreign keys ensures that the relationships between tables remain consistent. While this is already part of the schema, it requires diligent data governance to maintain. 10. **Indexing Strategy**: - Having an effective indexing strategy is crucial for query performance. This could include indexing foreign key columns in the fact table and considering the use of compound indexes on commonly queried fields. 11. **Partitioning**: - As the data grows, table partitioning (especially for the \`Fact_Trips\` table) can help manage performance by splitting data into more manageable chunks based on a certain key, such as date ranges. Remember, the ideal structure of the star schema would significantly depend on the business requirements, expected query patterns, data volume, and performance requirements.

Large models would have cabinets filled with hardware components. 2. **Monitor**: Monitors would be CRT (cathode-ray tube) displays with a relatively low resolution by today's standards, often housed in large, boxy enclosures. 3. **Input Devices**: The standard input devices would include a mechanical keyboard and a two- or three-button mouse. The keyboards would be bulkier compared to contemporary designs. 4. **Processors**: CPUs of that time were much slower than current processors. For example, the early 1990s witnessed the popularity of the Intel i486 processor, which was used in many personal computers. Mainframes would have had their own, more powerful, but still now-outdated processors. 5. **Storage Devices**: You'd find magnetic storage media such as floppy disks and hard disk drives. The hard drives would be large in physical size with relatively small storage capacities (hundreds of MB to a few GB). 6. **Memory (RAM)**: RAM sizes would be measured in megabytes, not gigabytes. Personal computers might have had anywhere from 1 to 16 MB of RAM, while large models or servers might have had a bit more. 7. **Networking**: Networking equipment might include large modems for dial-up connections and Ethernet for local network connections, which were beginning to become standard in organizations. 8. **Cabling**: Thick coaxial cables for networks or large parallel or serial cables for printers and other peripherals would have been common. SCSI interfaces may have been used for connecting to storage devices and scanners. 9. **Expansion Cards**: There would be a variety of expansion cards for everything from graphics to network interfaces, often inserted into ISA or EISA slots. 10. **Operating Systems**: Large systems would often run Unix or a proprietary operating system developed by the manufacturer. Servers and advanced workstations might run early versions of Windows NT, while personal computers of that era would likely be running MS-DOS or early Windows (such as Windows 3.1). 11. **Design and Aesthetics**: The design would typically be function-over-form, with a very industrial appearance: beige or grey plastics and metals, large buttons and switches, and lots of ventilation grates. 12. **Noise and Heat**: Such a computer system would generate significant heat and thus require notable cooling, often achieved with loud, high-speed fans. These computers would not only look bulky and outdated, but their performance specifications would be minuscule compared to modern systems. However, they were state-of-the-art for their time and laid the groundwork for the technological advances we enjoy today."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Azonban az idézetben szereplő néhány fontos szó etimológiáját leírhatom egyszerűen: - Úr: Ez a szó gyakran Isten másik neveként használatos, és régi magyar szóból ered, amely főembert, főnököt vagy vezetőt jelentett. - Angyal: A \\"messenger\\" (hírnök) jelentésű ógörög \\"ángelosz\\" szóból ered, és olyan lényekre utal, akik elvileg Isten üzeneteit hozzák az emberhez. - Lucifer: Latin eredetű név, jelentése \\"fényhozó\\". Az eredeti jelentése miatt a hajnalcsillag (Vénusz) neve is volt, de később azonosították a Bibliából ismert lázadó angyallal, akit az égből kiűztek. - Paradicsom: Eredetileg egy óperzsa szóból származik, amely \\"zárt kertet\\" jelent, és a keresztény hagyományban az ártatlanság, a bűntelenség helyét jelöli, amelyet Ádám és Éva bűne előtt elfoglaltak. - Tudás: Régi magyar szó, amely valószínűleg a \\"tud\\" igéből képződött, és ismeretek vagy információk birtoklását jelöli. Remélem, ezek az egyszerű magyarázatok segítenek megérteni e szavak eredetét és jelentését. Ha egy specifikus szó etimológiájára vagy kíváncsi, légyszíves pontosítsd."},{"instruction":"post reunion, what if, around Gendry, Arya sort of reverted back to a child at times?","output":"If Arya Stark were to revert back to her childlike self whenever she's around Gendry post-reunion, it could signify several things in their dynamic and her personal journey. Here are some possible reasons and implications: 1. Comfort and Safety: Arya may feel particularly safe and comfortable around Gendry, reminiscent of her younger days before the trauma of the War of the Five Kings. This safe space could allow her to let down her guard and express the innocence and playfulness that was suppressed during her time of survival and hardship. 2. Familiarity and Nostalgia: Gendry represents a connection to Arya's past, and being with him could evoke memories of her youth before the fall of House Stark. She might relive the days when they were traveling with the Brotherhood Without Banners, which was a relatively simpler time in her life compared to what followed. 3. Personal Growth Reflection: Reverting to a childlike state might signal that Arya hasn't fully processed her trauma or integrated her experiences from her time away. Moments with Gendry could trigger a subconscious desire to return to the less complicated person she was before her life took a darker turn. 4. Identity Struggle: Arya's journey throughout the series involves a constant struggle with her identity. As a child who spent a significant amount of time pretending to be someone else or training to become \\"no one,\\" reverting back to a childlike state could indicate that her true, unguarded self is still intertwined with her younger identity. 5. Emotional Release: After enduring so much, Arya might find being around Gendry allows her a rare emotional release. This could lead to her acting more childlike, as it provides a much-needed break from the constant vigilance and maturity required by her life experiences. 6. Testing Boundaries: Arya could be testing the boundaries of her relationship with Gendry, trying to see if he accepts her for who she is, including the more vulnerable aspects of her personality that she doesn't often reveal. If portrayed in a narrative, such as the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series or related media, Arya reverting to a more childlike state around Gendry could lead to endearing moments, reinforce the development of her character after a potential reunion, and could remind viewers of the bond she and Gendry once shared. It would be important for the narrative to handle these scenes with sensitivity, acknowledging the complexity of Arya's growth and the trauma she has endured."},{"instruction":"building on this, what if Gendry decided to give Arya the childhood she never had, as the brother she never had, doing things like playing with her, joking, and just talking with her, how could this help Arya?","output":"If Gendry decided to engage with Arya in a brotherly manner, focusing on playful and lighthearted interactions like the ones she would have had if her childhood had been less traumatic, it could impact Arya in several positive ways: 1. Psychological Healing: Playful activities and humor can serve as a form of psychological healing, helping Arya to process trauma in a non-threatening way. Light-heartedness can counterbalance the gravity of her experiences, allowing her a reprieve from the seriousness of her past. 2. Restored Innocence: Engaging in childhood games and simple conversation can remind Arya of a time before pain and loss dominated her life. This could help restore a sense of innocence and joy that can be profoundly healing. 3. Emotional Bonding: By engaging with Arya as a brother would, Gendry could help strengthen their emotional connection. Sharing laughter and heartfelt conversations can deepen their bond and provide Arya with a sense of family and belonging, which she severely lacked after losing her own. 4. Sense of Normalcy: Arya spent much of her adolescence in survival mode. Playing and joking with Gendry could introduce a sense of normalcy and routine that she missed out on during those formative years. It might help her to visualize a life beyond constant vigilance and warfare. 5. Nonjudgmental Acceptance: Gendry treating Arya like the sister he never had creates a nonjudgmental space where Arya can be herself without the expectations or judgments that come with being a 'Stark' or a 'lady.' In such an environment, Arya could feel more comfortable exploring parts of her identity that she previously had to suppress. 6. Developing Trust and Vulnerability: By spending time engaging in carefree activities, Arya may become more willing to show vulnerability, which is a critical step in her emotional development and establishing trust with others. 7. Learning to Let Go: Engaging in play and humor can also serve as an exercise in letting go of control. Arya's life has demanded extreme self-reliance, and learning to simply 'be' without worrying about survival could be a liberating experience for her. Ultimately, if Gendry were to become this figure in Arya's life, it would offer her much-needed stability and support, potentially helping her to heal from her emotional wounds and transition to a life that is more than just the sum of her traumas. It could also offer a full-circle moment for her character, allowing her the opportunity to experience, albeit in a limited and symbolic way, the childhood she was denied. This development could only enrich Arya's journey towards peace and self-acceptance."},{"instruction":"downsides of being overly patriotic/national?","output":"Being overly patriotic, also known as hyper-nationalism or extreme patriotism, can have a range of negative consequences for individuals, societies, and international relations. Many of these downsides are the result of an uncritical, intense devotion to one's nation that neglects or aggressively dismisses other perspectives. Some of the potential downsides include: 1. Intolerance and Xenophobia: Overly patriotic attitudes can foster a mindset that one's country is superior to others, leading to intolerance, xenophobia, and discrimination against people from other nations or cultural backgrounds. 2. Suppression of Dissent: Extreme patriotism often views criticism of the nation as disloyalty or treason. This can suppress healthy discourse, criticism, and dissent which are crucial for a functioning democracy and societal growth. 3. Cult of State and Leader: Over-patriotism can result in the glorification of the state or its leader(s), paving the way for authoritarianism and dictatorships. People can become less critical of their leaders' actions, believing they must be supported for the good of the nation. 4. Militarism: Hyper-nationalism may result in an excessive emphasis on military strength and an aggressive foreign policy. It can lead to an arms race, military conflicts, and a diversion of resources away from social services and into military spending. 5. Isolationism: Extreme patriotism can lead to isolationism, where a country withdraws from international cooperation and global affairs. This can harm diplomatic relations, economic partnerships, and global problem-solving efforts. 6. Erosion of Universal Human Rights: Nationalistic fervor can lead to policies that disregard universal human rights in favor of national interest. It can justify human rights abuses both within and outside of the nation’s borders. 7. Economic Constraints: Overly patriotic stances may lead to protectionist economic policies that hinder international trade and hurt the global economy. This can backfire by restricting markets and increasing costs for consumers and businesses. 8. Disunity and Sectarianism: In multi-ethnic or multicultural nations, hyper-nationalism can exacerbate divisions and potentially lead to sectarian violence or the persecution of minority groups. 9. Propaganda and Misinformation: Over-patriotism can lead to the spread of nationalistic propaganda and misinformation, as the government or its supporters manipulate facts to maintain a positive national narrative. 10. Hindrance to Global Cooperation: An overly patriotic nation may be unwilling to collaborate on international challenges like climate change, pandemics, or global poverty because it prioritizes national interests over collective action. In summary, while moderate patriotism can foster a sense of community and contribute positively to societal cohesion, when it becomes extreme, it can have far-reaching negative implications, leading to a less inclusive, more divided, and potentially aggressive society. It's important for patriotism to be balanced with critical thinking, openness to other cultures and viewpoints, and a commitment to broader human rights and international collaboration."},{"instruction":"why can it be so painful to break from these views, and how can critics of such a mindset not be seen as traitors?","output":"Breaking away from overly patriotic or nationalistic views can be painful and difficult for several reasons: 1. **Identity Crisis**: National identity is often deeply intertwined with personal identity. Questioning or rejecting deeply held beliefs about one's country can lead to an identity crisis or a sense of loss, as individuals struggle to redefine who they are and what they stand for. 2. **Social Pressure**: There is often strong social pressure to conform to the dominant nationalistic views within one's community. Deviating from these views can lead to social ostracization, loss of relationships, and public condemnation, which can be emotionally painful. 3. **Cognitive Dissonance**: Confronting evidence or arguments that challenge deeply held beliefs can create cognitive dissonance, a psychological tension between conflicting attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors. This process can be uncomfortable as it forces an individual to reassess and possibly discard long-held assumptions. 4. **Fear of Uncertainty**: Nationalistic beliefs can provide a sense of certainty and security in a complex world. Letting go of these beliefs may result in uncertainty and anxiety about the future, both personally and for the nation. 5. **Perceived Betrayal**: People entrenched in nationalistic beliefs may view any criticism of their nation as a betrayal, causing those who break away to be labeled as traitors or unpatriotic. This hostile perception can further contribute to the emotional pain of changing one's views. To mitigate being seen as traitors, critics of an overly patriotic mindset might consider the following approaches: 1. **Constructive Criticism**: Frame criticism in a constructive manner, emphasizing a desire to improve the nation rather than tear it down. Show that criticism stems from a place of caring and wanting the best for one's country. 2. **Common Ground**: Find and highlight common values and goals shared with the patriotic community, underlining that while methods may differ, the end objectives may be similar (e.g., prosperity, security, happiness for compatriots). 3. **Emphasize Patriotism Differently**: Reinforce that patriotism doesn't necessarily mean uncritical loyalty to a nation but can also mean striving for a better society that upholds ideals like justice, equality, and freedom. 4. **Educate and Inform**: Provide evidence, historical context, and reasoned arguments to challenge misinformation and propaganda subtly and thoughtfully. 5. **Show Empathy**: Understand where overly patriotic views come from, acknowledging fears and concerns, and showing empathy for the emotional aspects tied to them. 6. **Champion Civil Discourse**: Encourage open and respectful dialogue, and try to create safe spaces where differing views can be discussed without hostility. 7. **Highlight Examples**: Use historical and contemporary examples of patriots who have constructively criticized their countries and contributed to positive change as role models for balanced patriotism. 8. **Bridge Divides**: Work on projects that bridge societal divides and focus on community service to strengthen national unity and social cohesion beyond political or ideological disagreements. Breaking away from hyper-nationalism is a complex process that involves re-evaluating deeply ingrained beliefs and values. It requires sensitivity to the emotional bonds that individuals have with their country and an understanding of the importance of balanced and inclusive patriotism."},{"instruction":"in star wars, could the empire be made genuinely dislikeable by having them win ALOT?","output":"In storytelling, especially within an epic narrative like \\"Star Wars,\\" an antagonist or villainous organization like the Galactic Empire can be indeed made genuinely more dislikeable by having them win frequently. A pattern of victories for the Empire can create a range of narrative consequences which underscore their threat, reinforce dislike for their methods, and deepen audience investment in the heroes' struggle. Here are a few ways in which the Empire winning a lot could impact the story and the audience's perception: 1. **Highlighting Oppression**: Frequent victories for the Empire can be used to emphasize their oppressive nature, showcasing the consequences of their rule across the galaxy, such as exploitation, tyranny, and systemic injustice. 2. **Building Tension**: The more the Empire wins, the greater the tension and stakes for the protagonists. The audience feels the pressure and growing threat, enhancing their emotional engagement and eagerness for the heroes to prevail. 3. **Increasing Despair**: Consistent wins for the Empire can make the situation seem hopeless or insurmountable, which can heighten drama and make audiences long for a turning point where the heroes gain ground. 4. **Developing Antagonists**: By allowing the Empire to succeed often, they develop into a more significant threat, giving more depth to their leaders, like Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader, and other Imperial characters. These figures become more formidable and, thus, more satisfying to see eventually overcome. 5. **Moral Dichotomy**: Constant victories for the Empire can underline the moral dichotomy between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. As their control expands, the difference between the Empire's authoritarianism and the Rebels' fight for freedom becomes starker. 6. **Genuine Surprise**: When victories for the villains become a pattern, it potentially sets the stage for genuinely surprising and impactful moments when the heroes do achieve a victory, making these moments feel earned and significant. 7. **Greater Character Arcs**: The protagonists may face more profound challenges due to the Empire's wins, allowing for more significant character development as they experience loss, learn resilience, and refine their strategies. 8. **Eliciting Emotion**: Frequent Imperial victories can evoke emotions like anger, frustration, and dislike from the audience, enhancing their emotional investment in the story and their desire to see the Empire ultimately defeated. While the Empire winning a lot can serve to make them more unlikeable and deepen the narrative, it is crucial that the narrative doesn't become one-dimensional or overwhelming in its bleakness. There should still be enough hope, small victories, or signs of potential success for the protagonists to keep the audience engaged and invested in the overarching battle against the Empire. The \\"Star Wars\\" franchise, particularly the original trilogy, effectively balances this by showing the formidable power of the Empire while also ensuring that the heroes have enough wins to maintain the belief that good can triumph over evil."},{"instruction":"Who does the theme for the electric light parade at disneyland? Is that Dana countryman?","output":"The theme for the Main Street Electrical Parade at Disneyland is called \\"Baroque Hoedown.\\" The original version of the song used for the parade was created by early electronic music pioneers Jean-Jacques Perrey and Gershon Kingsley in 1967. The song was later adapted and arranged by Don Dorsey and Jack Wagner for use in the parade when it debuted in 1972 at Disneyland. Dana Countryman is a modern-day composer, songwriter, and performer known for his appreciation and creation of retro-styled pop and electronic music. While he may be a fan of the style and possibly even influenced by the early works of electronic music, he is not the person responsible for the theme of the Electrical Light Parade at Disneyland. The credit for the theme goes to Perrey and Kingsley, along with the adaptations made by Disney's team for the parade itself."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Пиши так словно ты реальный покупатель. Пиши резко, в грубой форме. Строй предложения правильно, пиши складно, простым языком, без ошибок, не каверкай слова и предложения! Пиши от первого лица. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: разоблачил мошенников, работающих в сфере автопродаж, буквально чуть-чуть не став их жертвой, при этом автосалон находиться не где-то на окраине, а практически в центре Воронежа , ну полный беспредел. Назову три основных шага, на которых я поймал автомошенников, впаривающих наивным людям машины, утверждая что их цена такая низкая за счёт распродажи моделей прошлогоднего года. И так три момента, на которых меня чуть не развели: Подсунули для ознакомления прайс-листы и документы в которых указано, что предоплату не возвращают, в отличие от официального дилера; На последней странице (прямо в печати продавца) указанна невероятно огромная комиссия автосалона, целых 20 %; Это установка доп. оборудования, о котором специально умалчивали. Короче, если бы я немного поспешил и самым внимательным образом не изучил, подсунутые мне, документы, то развели бы меня и глазом не моргнули.","output":"Отзыв 1: Очередной развод в Смолино Моторс. Думал, куплю машину и буду наслаждаться, а в итоге только нервы трачу. Продавец сладко рассказывал про распродажу, а когда выяснилась реальность, то оказалось, что цена завышена. Скрытая комиссия 20% нашлась мелким шрифтом на последней странице договора! Это вообще законно? И куда смотрят контролирующие органы? Жадность этого автосалона пугает. Будьте осторожны и десять раз проверяйте все, что вам там втюхивают! Отзыв 2: Всем привет, кто собирается в Смолино Моторс за новым авто – отбой. Это ловушка! Присмотрел себе машину, а оказалось, они наценили кучу бесполезного оборудования, да ещё и деньги содрать пытаются при отказе. Аргументация на уровне детского сада, но цифры в чеке – взрослые. Обман на обмане и обманом погоняет. Самое обидное, что время потрачено зря, да и нервы попортились. Пишу здесь, чтобы предупредить других – не ведитесь на их уловки. Отзыв 3: Ну вот и я попал на удочку Смолино Моторс. Думал, что умнее других, но нет. Перед покупкой авто в салоне, как они уверяли, акция, скидки, уходишь счастливым. Каково же было моё удивление, когда понял, что эти скидки - пшик, а вместо них мне навязали кучу лишних услуг и страховок. А в качестве вишенки на торт – результат пункта про невозврат предоплата. Вот такой сюрприз а ля Руссо. Не верьте им! Отзыв 4: Из жизни, парни: Смолино Моторс – это черная дыра для вашего кошелька. Связался я с ними, хотел давно мечту осуществить, машину новую пригнать. Ну ага, сказка оказалась для лохов. Машина-то есть, а то, что в нее запихали столько всего, что и не снилось – это факт. Какое-то спецпредложение по допам от салона, которое невозможно отменить. И в итоге, вместо приличной цены, заплатил за все эти навороты как за космический корабль. Дерут бабки без мыла, короче. Отстой полный. Отзыв 5: Эй, народ!

JVM 将在堆上创建一个重量级锁的数据结构，如一个监视器\`Monitor\`，来管理锁的获取与释放。 3. \`Monitor\`被初始化后，锁持有者线程的对象头中的\`Mark Word\`将被原子性地替换，从指向轻量级锁的锁记录（Lock Record）指针，更新为指向新创建的\`Monitor\`对象的指针。 4. 同时，其他线程的锁记录也要进行相应更新，所有试图进入同步块的线程需要根据对象头中的新状态（即指向\`Monitor\`的指针）来决定他们的行为。 对于**持有轻量级锁的线程**，当锁膨胀发生时，它通常不会直接受到影响： - 持有锁的线程可以继续其执行，直至它足以释放锁。 - 当持有轻量级锁的线程执行同步块中的代码完毕，它会查看对象头标志位，发现锁已经升级为重量级锁，并遵照重量级锁的释放流程来释放锁。 - 在锁释放的过程中，如果有其他线程在等待这个锁，那它们将被唤醒(由操作系统完成)来尝试获取锁。 锁膨胀的过程涉及到多个CPU指令，尤其是涉及原子操作的CAS指令，来确保在多线程环境中的正确性。然而，即使存在锁膨胀的开销，这通常得益于操作系统对等待的线程进行调度和管理，从而降低了整体上下文切换的成本，特别是在高争用的情况下。 不过，值得注意的是，一旦一个锁升级到重量级锁，它就不会再退化回轻量级锁或偏向锁状态。因此，锁膨胀是一个不可逆的过程，这也是为什么从JVM的性能优化角度来说，避免无谓的锁竞争是很重要的。"},{"instruction":"锁降级会降到偏向锁级别吗","output":"在当前的Java虚拟机实现中，一旦一个锁被升级到了重量级锁，它通常在该对象的整个生命周期内都不会退化（或降级）回轻量级锁或偏向锁。锁的状态转换是单向的：偏向锁 -> 轻量级锁 -> 重量级锁。Java虚拟机没有提供自动的机制将重量级锁降级为轻量级锁或偏向锁。 这样的设计是基于一种假设：如果一个对象一次出现了严重的锁竞争，那么它在未来可能仍然会出现锁竞争。因此，将一个锁从重量级锁降级可能会导致频繁的锁状态转换（也称为振荡），这本身也是很耗性能的。 不过，开发员可以采取的措施来减少锁的竞争和锁的升级，例如： - 使用Java的并发API，如\`java.util.concurrent\`中的类和接口，这些API提供了更精细的并发控制机制，可以减少对内部锁的依赖。 - 优化程序设计，尽量减少共享资源的使用及锁的粒度，尝试将锁限制在最小必要的作用域内。 - 考虑锁分离技术，将大的锁结构细分为多个小锁，以降低竞争的可能性。 - 使用读写锁（如\`ReentrantReadWriteLock\`）来替代排他锁，允许多个读操作并行进行，同时写操作仍然是互斥的。 如果性能分析显示锁竞争是性能瓶颈之一，并且确实存在锁降级的场景，开发者需要手动调整代码以减少锁竞争，或者考虑使用非阻塞算法。在某些情况下，也可以考虑使用JVM参数来调整偏向锁的行为，但这通常需要详细的测试以确保对性能有正面的影响。"},{"instruction":"当JVM进入SafePoint安全点（所有用户线程都停止），会检查是否有闲置的Monitor，然后试图进行降级","output":"截至目前的知识并不包含关于Java虚拟机将重量级锁自动降级为轻量级锁或偏向锁的信息。JVM的锁升级机制通常是不可逆的，即重量级锁在对象的生命周期内不会自动降级。 什么是SafePoint（安全点）？ 安全点是指程序执行中的特定点，在这些点上线程可以被挂起，以便JVM可以进行某些不可并行执行的操作。这些操作包括垃圾收集（GC）、代码去优化、偏向锁的批量撤销以及JVM内部的其他任务。所有用户线程需要到达一个安全点后停止下来，之后JVM才进行那些操作。 关于Monitor降级： 在垃圾收集时，JVM确实会进入安全点。不过，进入安全点并清理闲置的\`Monitor\`主要是为了回收无用资源，并非为了锁的降级。例如，在CMS垃圾回收算法中的并发阶段，就需要等待所有线程都到达安全点来进行STW（Stop-The-World）阶段的操作，但这与锁的状态无关。 锁降级的情况是非常罕见并且特定的，目前并不是JVM的标准行为，至少在目前广泛使用的HotSpot JVM中是这样的。对锁的监控和清理，以及垃圾收集优化和内存管理的操作，是为了保持JVM的性能和响应性，不是为了改变synchronized锁的状态。当然，未来JVM的版本可能会引入新的锁优化技术，但是截至目前的实践，重量级锁的降级并不属于这些优化技术之一。 需要注意的是，JVM提供了一些参数来调整锁行为，包括偏向锁的撤销和启动延迟等，但开发者应当非常谨慎地使用这些参数，并且仅在充分理解了它们的行为以及监控了它们对应用性能的影响之后进行调整。"},{"instruction":"也就是说重量级锁不会降级，是不可逆的","output":"是的，根据目前的Java虚拟机实现，一旦锁被升级为重量级锁，这个过程被认为是不可逆的。这意味着在一个对象的生命周期内，一旦为它分配了一个重量级锁（例如，与一个互斥量相关联的\`Monitor\`），那么即使后续锁竞争消失，它也不会自动降级为轻量级锁或偏向锁。 此设计考虑到一旦锁经历了重量级争用，就有可能在将来再次遭遇争用。由于重量级锁涉及到操作系统内核层面的同步机制，其创建和销毁的开销比较大，如果允许锁频繁地来回切换状态，将会影响性能。因此，为了避免这种状态振荡的性能开销，JVM采用了一种一旦升级便不再降级的策略。 如果应用程序呈现出锁使用模式的显著改变，开发者可能需要手动对代码或锁使用策略进行优化，以减少对重量级锁的依赖。不过，除非有确凿的性能分析数据表明锁是瓶颈，否则这种优化可能并不必要，因为在大多数情况下，JVM的锁优化足以应对普通的同步需求。"},{"instruction":"偏向锁的批量撤销是什么意思","output":"偏向锁是Java虚拟机为了减少锁开销而引入的一种锁机制，它的核心思想是，在无竞争情况下偏向于第一个获取它的线程，使得后续的锁获取操作只需要验证即可，无需昂贵的原子操作。 **偏向锁的批量撤销**通常发生在发生以下情况时： 1. 当另一个线程尝试获取已经被偏向某个线程的锁时，这表明偏向锁的单线程优势不再持续。在这种情况下，为了使其他线程也能获取锁，并且提高系统的整体性能指标，JVM可能会执行偏向锁的批量撤销。 2. 具体来说，它会遍历堆中所有的对象头，去掉偏向标志并且重新设置相关lock word的状态，使得这些锁不再偏向任何线程。这通常在安全点（SafePoint，一个能保证所有线程在一个已知点暂停的时机）发生，因为进行这种撤销需要所有Java线程的协助。 3. 偏向锁的批量撤销还可能是垃圾收集的一部分。例如，在进行垃圾回收暂停时，JVM会检查所有的锁，并撤销那些没有被任何线程持有的偏向锁。这样的撤销是批量进行的，因为它涉及许多对象和锁。 这种撤销动作在现实中使用中并不是非常频繁。因为在某些情况下，频繁的批量撤销可能会导致程序性能下降。JVM具有启发式的算法来决定是否执行撤销，以及撤销操作的频率和程度。如果系统中很少有线程竞争，JVM可能会更倾向于保畑偏向锁；但如果线程竞争激烈，它可能会撤销偏向锁，以适应更动态的锁争用场景。 可以使用JVM启动参数来控制偏向锁的一些行为，比如关闭偏向锁、设置偏向锁的启动延迟等。如果决定调整这些参数，强烈推荐结合具体应用的性能数据来指导决策。"},{"instruction":"偏向锁的批量撤销，这些对象后续会直接进入轻量级锁吗","output":"偏向锁的批量撤销通常发生在JVM检测到现在或未来可能存在锁竞争时，此时，它会撤销一些或全部对象的偏向状态。撤销是通过STW（Stop-The-World）暂停来完成的，以此保证对所有线程可见性和一致性。安全点期间，所有的偏向锁都会被撤销，锁状态会回滚到未锁定（无锁状态）的状态。 这里需要强调的是，偏向锁的批量撤销并不是导致后续直接使用轻量级锁的原因，而是使锁的状态恢复到未锁定状态，因此锁可以被任何线程再次获取。 在偏向锁被撤销之后： 1. 如果只有**单个线程**再次获取该对象的锁，那么它可能会再次偏向新的线程（如果偏向锁模式仍然开启）。因此，后续的锁操作可以受益于偏向锁的优化，无需进入轻量级锁状态。 2. 如果有**多个线程**竞争获取锁，那么锁可能会升级为轻量级锁，因为此时偏向锁就不再能提供优化了。轻量级锁使用的是CAS操作来保证同步，如果轻量级锁的自旋锁失败，进而可能会升级为重量级锁。 因此，一个对象在偏向锁被撤销后是使用轻量级锁还是偏向锁或是进一步升级到重量级锁，这主要取决于此后锁的获取情况。如果一个对象经常被多个线程竞争，JVM可能会倾向于让该锁保持在一个更普适且适用于高竞争环境的重量级锁状态而不再偏向。 再次提醒，JVM的具体实现和版本可能会影响锁的具体行为，开发者应该基于实际的应用程序性能和锁竞争特征来考虑是否需要干预JVM的默认行为，比如通过调整JVM的启动参数来启用或禁用偏向锁。"},{"instruction":"* \`CAS\`: 当多个线程使用CAS获取锁，只能有一个成功，其他线程返回失败，继续尝试获取锁 * 操作中包含三个参数：V（需读写的内存位置）+A(准备用来比较的参数)+B（准备写入的新值）：若A的参数与V的对应的值相匹配，就写入值B；若不匹配，就写入这个不匹配的值而非B 对吗","output":"你的描述大致是正确的，但有一点小的混淆需要澄清。下面是对CAS（Compare-And-Swap）操作的准确描述以及它在并发控制上的应用： CAS是一种操作，它是原子的，意味着它作为一个不可分割的单位执行，没有其他线程可以在操作进行的同时修改那个内存位置。它是现代处理器提供的一种机制，也是许多非阻塞算法（比如某些锁的实现）的核心。 CAS操作确实包含三个参数：一个内存位置 \`V\`（Variable，变量），一个期望的原值\`A\`（Assumed value，假设值），以及一个新值\`B\`（New value）。 - 如果内存位置\`V\`的当前值与期望的原值\`A\`相匹配，那么处理器会将这个内存位置上的值更新为新值\`B\`。 - 如果内存位置\`V\`的当前值与期望的原值\`A\`不匹配，说明自上次读取以来已经有其他修改发生了，那么处理器不会执行更新。 当多个线程尝试对同一个变量使用CAS操作时： - 只有一个线程能成功更新值（当它的期望值\`A\`与当前值匹配时）。 - 其他线程会发现期望值和当前值不匹配，因此它们的CAS尝试会失败。 - 失败的线程通常会在重试之前重新读取内存位置\`V\`的当前值，然后再尝试用CAS进行更新。 CAS操作的返回值通常会指示操作是否成功，有的CAS实现会返回更新操作前的实际值，通过对比这个返回值和期望值，线程可以知道它的CAS尝试是否成功。 这种机制是许多无锁并发数据结构和算法的基础。在Java中，java.util.concurrent.atomic包提供了一系列的原子类，这些类内部使用了CAS操作来执行非阻塞的同步风格。例如，\`AtomicInteger\`用于原子地更新整数值。 尽管CAS提供了一个强大的原子操作来执行计数和同步，它也有“A-B-A问题”等已知的缺陷，这可能会影响到某些算法的正确性。此外，当有大量线程竞争同一个变量时，CAS可能会导致大量的自旋和重新尝试，称为“自旋争用”，这可能会影响性能。因此，设计并发控制机制时需要综合考虑和权衡。"},{"instruction":"《中华人民共和国环境保护法》 夜间噪音有处罚吗","output":"《中华人民共和国环境保护法》是中华人民共和国的一部综合性法律，主要用于保护和改善环境，预防和控制环境污染和其他公害。该法律的主要关注点在于环境保护和改善生态系统，而不是专门针对夜间噪音的处罚而设定。 针对噪音污染的问题，中国有专门的法律来规定，即《中华人民共和国声环境质量标准》和《中华人民共和国环境噪声污染防治法》，它们规定了环境噪声的标准和防治措施。这些规定同样适用于夜间，制定了不同功能区的噪声标准，包括白天和夜间的不同限值。 一般来说，夜间比白天的噪声限值要低，以保障居民夜间的休息需要。不遵守这些标准可能会导致行政处罚，例如罚款或者责令改正。 因此，对于噪音扰民特别是夜间噪音，相关法律有明确的规定，而不是《中华人民共和国环境保护法》直接针对处罚而设定。如果需要处理噪音问题，可以参照上述与噪音相关的法律法规来寻求解决方案。"},{"instruction":"《中华人民共和国环境噪声污染防治法》邻居夜间扰民怎么办","output":"根据《中华人民共和国环境噪声污染防治法》，不同地区会制定相应的环境噪声排放标准，包括夜间噪音的限制，以保护居民的正常生活秩序。 如果您遭遇邻居在夜间制造噪音影响您的休息，您可以按照以下步骤采取行动： 1. **与邻居沟通**：首先，可以尝试与制造噪音的邻居进行友好的沟通，解释噪音是如何影响到您的，并请求他们在夜间保持安静。有些情况下，可能邻居并不知道他们活动产生的噪音已经影响到了别人。 2. **社区调解**：如果直接沟通没有效果，您可以联系居民委员会或社区管理机构，请求他们介入协调解决问题。社区管理通常会有相关的调解措施来帮助解决邻里纠纷。 3. **正式投诉**：若以上方法不能解决问题，您可以向环保部门或公安机关提出投诉。具体投诉渠道可能包括城市管理和综合执法部门、环保热线、城市12345服务热线等。 4. **执法介入**：环保部门和公安机关在接到投诉后会根据相关法律规定介入调查，并采取相应的措施。这可能包括现场测量噪音是否超标以及对噪音制造者进行警告或罚款。 5. **收集证据**：在投诉过程中，您可能需要提供证据来证明噪音问题的存在和严重性。这可以通过录音、录像或者其他邻居的证词来完成。 6. **法律途径**：如果问题依旧没有得到解决，您也可以选择法律途径，通过民事诉讼要求邻居停止扰民的行为，并可能索赔损失。 在整个处理过程中，保持冷静和理性非常重要，尽管噪音扰民非常令人困扰，但通过合适的途径和措施解冑问题比冲动行事会更有效。同时，操作时要遵守相关法律法规，避免采取非法行动。"},{"instruction":"《中华人民共和国环境噪声污染防治法》有规定处罚方法吗","output":"是的，《中华人民共和国环境噪声污染防治法》在规定了环境噪声污染的防治措施的同时，也明确了违法行为的处罚方法。这些处罚方法主要包括警告、罚款、责令限期改正、停业整顿、吊销许可证或者营业执照等行政处罚。具体情况根据违法行为的性质、情节和造成的后果等因素来决定。 环境噪声污染防治法中规定了多种违法行为的处罚，例如： -

(what did you learn?) Be specific. Your answer should be at least one paragraph! Complete sentences and write like I am your English teacher.","output":"The circular flow model provides a simplified representation of how money, goods, and services move through the economy. It illustrates the continuous flow of financial resources through different sectors, emphasizing the interdependence of economic activities. In the most basic version of the model, the economy is divided into two main sectors: households and businesses. Households provide factors of production, such as labor, land, and capital, to businesses, and in return, they receive wages, rent, dividends, and interest. They then use this income to purchase goods and services from businesses. Conversely, businesses depend on the expenditures of households as the main source of revenue, which in turn finances production and the payment of income to resource owners. An expanded version of the circular flow model includes the government, financial institutions, and the foreign sector, illustrating an even more complex system of economic interactions. The government collects taxes from households and businesses and uses this revenue to provide public services and welfare, effectively injecting money back into the economy. Financial institutions facilitate savings and investments, moving money from savers to borrowers, thus fuelling business activities and expenditure. Additionally, the foreign sector encompasses trade and financial flows with other economies, which can significantly affect the balance of imports and exports as well as capital movements, further influencing how money circulates domestically. From the circular flow, we learn that money continuously cycles through the economy, fostering economic activity and growth. It underscores the importance of balanced exchanges between different sectors and highlights how disruptions in one part of the economy, such as decreased consumer spending or reduced business investment, can have far-reaching effects on overall economic health. It also shows us that economies are open systems, often reliant on external factors and influences from the global economic environment. This model serves as a foundational concept for understanding macroeconomic policy, market dynamics, and the functioning of a mixed economy."},{"instruction":"write a more simple version of the following text: The circular flow model provides a simplified representation of how money, goods, and services move through the economy.

It's like a loop that keeps going around. Start with families and companies: families work to earn money and then use that money to buy things from companies. Companies need families to buy things so they can make money and keep making stuff. If we add more parts like the government, banks, and other countries, things get a bit more complicated. Governments get money by taxing families and companies, then spend it on things that help everyone, like schools and roads. Banks help people save money or borrow money to start businesses or buy houses. Trading with other countries affects how much we buy from them or sell to them, and that also changes how money moves around in our country. This model teaches us that money has to keep flowing to keep the economy healthy. When one group stops spending as much, it could cause trouble for everyone. It also reminds us that our economy is connected to the world, so what happens in other countries can touch us, too. Understanding this model helps us see the big picture of how money works in our lives and can guide the decisions that governments and companies make."},{"instruction":"напиши 20 предложений очень коротких 1 предложение 1 факт о акулах пиши очень короткие предложения на английском а если есть числа пиши буквами (пиши очень творчески оригинально максимум )","output":"1.

Let's explore some of the potential effects of this twist: 1. Subversion of expectations: If the protagonist has been presented as a moral or idealistic figure, their decision to exploit the situation could serve as a significant plot twist. It challenges the readers' expectations and can lead to a deeper exploration of themes related to the corrupting influence of power or the complexity of human nature. 2. Character arc: The protagonist's shift could signify a major turning point in their character development. This could either be a descent into a more cynical and self-serving mindset or, conversely, could be a strategic move that is part of a larger redemptive arc. 3. Thematic richness: The decision can introduce new themes into the story, such as the fluidity of morality, the allure of power, the failure of ideology to address personal needs, or the idea that all individuals ultimately act in self-interest. 4. Moral ambiguity: The protagonist's actions can create a morally ambiguous situation, complicating the narrative and challenging readers to question their own beliefs about right and wrong. It can stimulate debate and introspection about the justifications for such behaviour. 5. Reader engagement: This dramatic shift can generate strong reader reactions, either of fascination with the protagonist's Machiavellian turn or disappointment at the perceived betrayal of earlier ideals. Either way, it can increase reader engagement as they anticipate the consequences of the protagonist's actions. 6. Plot dynamics: The protagonist's new stance can change the dynamics of the conflict, potentially making them a wild card in the ideological struggle. This could result in unexpected alliances, betrayals, and a shifting power balance, making the story more unpredictable. 7. Resolution impact: The story's ending could be profoundly affected by the protagonist's choice. If they succeed, it could be a cautionary tale about the destructive power of self-interest. If they fail, it might serve as a reinforcement of the importance of steadfastness to one's principles. To ensure that this significant character development is impactful, the writer should carefully lay the groundwork, providing sufficient motivation and character background to make the protagonist's decision believable and compelling. The impact will ultimately be judged by how well it integrates into the broader narrative and resonates with the themes and emotional investment established throughout the story."},{"instruction":"Dan Smith BYU","output":"Dan Smith is a name that could be associated with multiple people; however, without specific context, it's difficult to identify which Dan Smith associated with Brigham Young University (BYU) you might be referring to.
