Doherty was among several embassy staff who were on a State Department-led intelligence mission to find and destroy missiles that had been looted during the Libyan uprising. The mission was part of an effort to secure weapons that could be used for terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in the region. Doherty had been working as a security contractor in Libya since the onset of the revolution in 2011. During the attack, Doherty and Ambassador Chris Stevens were killed by a group of armed militants who stormed the consulate. The exact circumstances surrounding their deaths remain unclear, but it appears that they were specifically targeted by the attackers. Doherty's death has been met with widespread sadness and disbelief. He was described by his colleagues as a loyal and dedicated professional who took great pride in his work. He was also known for his sense of humor and his ability to lighten the mood in difficult situations. Doherty's death has highlighted the dangers faced by American diplomats and military personnel in the Middle East. It has also raised questions about the effectiveness of U.S. security measures in the region. The incident has prompted a flurry of political activity in Washington, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle calling for an investigation into the attack. Some have criticized the Obama administration's handling of the situation, while others have argued that the incident underscores the need for greater U.S. engagement in the region. Despite the tragic loss of life, many in the intelligence community believe that the mission undertaken by Doherty and his colleagues was a critical one. The fact that they were willing to risk their lives to protect U.S. interests abroad is a testament to their bravery and dedication. Doherty's legacy will undoubtedly be felt in the intelligence and security communities for years to come. His sacrifice serves as a reminder of the dangers faced by those who work to defend American interests abroad, and of the importance of supporting those who serve our country overseas."},{"instruction":"Math problem: Solve 3*h = 171 162 for h.

Check your memory Install an operating system. Install your drivers","output":"When setting up a new computer or laptop, there are a few essential steps to ensure everything runs smoothly. Firstly, it's crucial to make sure the battery is inserted correctly. This may seem like an obvious step, but it's often overlooked, and can cause problems such as power loss or instability. Next, it's essential to check your memory. This involves checking that the RAM is correctly installed and configured. Improperly installed memory can cause system instability and crashes. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the memory is compatible with the motherboard to avoid any conflicts or compatibility issues. Once your memory has been checked, it's then important to install an operating system. This involves setting up the software that will run your computer or laptop. There are many different operating systems available, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It's important to choose one that meets your needs and is compatible with your hardware. Finally, installing your drivers is the last essential step in setting up your new computer. Drivers are small pieces of software that allow your operating system to communicate with the hardware components of your computer.

The first step is to \\"keep to it.\\" This means setting clear goals and plans and committing to them. One of the biggest obstacles to success is losing motivation or getting sidetracked by other tasks or distractions. By setting a clear plan and sticking to it, you are more likely to stay focused and make progress. This requires discipline and determination, but the rewards are well worth it. The second step is to \\"don't stress about it.\\" This may seem counterintuitive, but stressing or worrying excessively can actually be detrimental to your progress. Stress can lead to fatigue, burnout or even giving up altogether. Instead, focus on the present moment and what you can do right now. Trust in your plan and your abilities and have confidence that you will reach your goals in due time. The final step is to \\"revise it.\\" Even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it's important to be flexible and adaptable. Regularly reviewing your progress and adjusting your plan as necessary can help you stay on track and make the most of unexpected opportunities or challenges. This also allows you to look back on your progress and celebrate your achievements along the way. In conclusion, \\"keep to it, don't stress about it, revise it\\" is a simple yet effective mantra for achieving success.

A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious.

The cascade of persontoperson spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (overt) TB and putting them on antiTB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others.

For President Obama, loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In the aftermath of Scott Brown's stunning victory in the Massachusetts special election, many Democrats are coming to grips with the fact that the public is not particularly happy with their stewardship. The wind is now at the Republicans' backs, and they may be able to put the brakes on the comprehensive health care bill that has been a cornerstone of the Obama administration's domestic agenda. Brown's win gives the GOP yet another case study in how to run successful campaigns, particularly in blue states where the Republican brand has been tarnished in recent years. Brown's message of fiscal responsibility and opposition to Democratic policies resonated with voters who are increasingly skeptical of government spending and intrusion. The defeat in Massachusetts is a major setback for President Obama, who campaigned hard for Democrat Martha Coakley in the final days leading up to the election. The loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities and perhaps even his entire approach to governance and leadership. One immediate effect of Brown's victory is that the Senate will not have the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster and pass the health care bill. This means that Democrats will have to scale back their ambitions for health care reform or try to push it through using a procedural maneuver known as reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority vote. But even if Democrats are successful in passing some form of health care reform, the political damage has already been done. The public is deeply divided on the issue, and many are angry at the way the process has been handled by the Obama administration and congressional leaders. The lesson for Democrats is clear: they must do a better job of listening to the concerns of the American people and working towards policies that are responsive to those concerns. The wind may be at the Republicans' backs for now, but there is still plenty of room for Democrats to regroup and refocus their efforts on winning back the trust and support of the American people."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question Mass incarceration in the United States disproportionately impacts African American and Latino communities.

In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...

In light of recent incidents of racial abuse during matches, Jordaan argues that there should be \\"no compromise\\" on the issue of racism in football. Jordaan's call for tougher action comes as FIFA investigates allegations of racist abuse during the recent World Cup in Russia. While FIFA has imposed fines and other sanctions on football societies found guilty of racism, Jordaan contends that more needs to be done to hold individuals accountable for their actions. According to Jordaan, \\"individuals who engage in racist behavior should be banned from football for life.\\" He argues that such a measure will send a clear message that racism has no place in football or any other aspect of society. Jordaan's stance is supported by many who believe that more needs to be done to tackle racism in football. In recent years, there have been numerous incidents of racist abuse during matches, including the throwing of bananas at black players and the use of racial slurs. The issue of racism in football has become a major concern for FIFA and other organizations, with many calling for stronger action to address the problem. While FIFA has taken steps to combat racism, it remains an ongoing issue that requires continued attention and effort.

The Slavic tribes that settled in the area in the 6th and 7th centuries often raided each other's territories and neighboring lands, including Poland. In the following centuries, various other groups, such as Vikings, Magyars, and Mongols, launched their own attacks on Poland. The most well-known and destructive raids on Poland, however, were conducted during World War II. From September 1939 to May 1945, Poland was occupied by German forces, who conducted numerous raids and massacres throughout the country.

Another important factor to consider is the condition of your fish's body parts. Check their fins for any signs of damage or discoloration, which could be an indication of injury or disease.

If you notice any mucus on your fish, isolate them from the rest of the tank and seek professional help.

Cooke had taken the photo to protest against the removal of signs placed on the Evans Head beachfront, which she labelled as 'sexist'. In response to the removal of the signs, Cooke took to social media to express her disappointment and posted a photo of herself in a bikini. However, the photo quickly attracted negative feedback from some members of the community, who deemed it inappropriate and offensive. Cooke has defended her post, stating that if a male had been wearing a similar outfit, no one would have complained. She believes that the removal of the signs highlights a double standard in how men and women's bodies are viewed and policed in society. Despite the backlash, Cooke's actions have gained support from many in her community. A petition has been started in Evans Head to get the signs back, with many citing the need for body positivity and the right to wear whatever one feels comfortable in. The incident has sparked debate around the world, with many people questioning the role of society in policing women's bodies. It highlights the importance of gender equality and respect for everyone, regardless of their gender or clothing choices.

As a result, she developed a severe infection that led to organ failure and the amputation of her toes. Currently, Parker fears that she may lose her legs below the knees.

If you have a hookah and want to prepare a flavorful shisha session, follow these simple steps: First, stir the shisha to ensure that it is evenly mixed. Using your fingers or a fork, gently break apart any large clumps or chunks that may have formed. Next, sprinkle the shisha into the bowl, making sure to distribute it evenly. It's important not to over-pack the bowl or leave any gaps, as this can impact the flavor and quality of the smoke. Once the shisha is in the bowl, cover it with a piece of foil or a heat management device. This helps to ensure that the shisha heats evenly and doesn't burn. Make sure that the foil or device is tightly secured around the edges of the bowl. Finally, finish assembling the hookah by adding the coal to the top of the foil or heat management device. It's recommended to use natural coconut coals as they burn hotter and last longer than other types of coals. Wait a few minutes for the coal to heat up the shisha before taking your first puff. By following these steps, you can enjoy a delicious shisha session with a smooth and flavorful smoke. Remember to always be safe when smoking and to never leave the hookah unattended.

In addition to being nutrient-dense and high in fiber, oats have also been found to be effective at removing certain nutrients from the soil in which they grow. Two of the most important nutrients that oats can remove from soil are P2O5 and K2O. P2O5 is a form of phosphorus that is often used as a fertilizer because it is essential for plant growth. However, excessive use of P2O5 can cause environmental problems such as eutrophication of waterways. K2O, on the other hand, is a form of potassium that is also important for plant growth. Studies have shown that oats are more effective at removing K2O from soil than P2O5. This is because oats have a higher demand for potassium than phosphorus. In fact, oats can remove up to 150 pounds of K2O per bushel, compared to only 20-30 pounds of P2O5 per bushel. While oats can be useful for removing excess nutrients from soil, it is important to note that they should not be relied upon as the sole method of nutrient removal. Other practices, such as rotating crops and using cover crops, should also be employed to maintain healthy soil and prevent environmental problems. In conclusion, oats are more effective at removing K2O from soil than P2O5. This makes them a useful tool for managing soil nutrient levels, but they should be used in conjunction with other practices to ensure the long-term health of the soil."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Travis: so u got a fever or sth?

To keep your tree in top shape, there are three important tasks you need to prioritize: pinching and trimming, watering, and repotting. Pinching and trimming is a pruning technique that keeps your tree from getting too big and spreading out of control. The goal is to cut back branches and stems to help your tree grow in a more desirable shape. You can pinch and trim your tree every few weeks or as needed, depending on its growth rate and the results you want to achieve. Watering is equally important, as trees need ample moisture to survive and thrive. Check the soil around the tree regularly, and if it feels dry to the touch, water it deeply. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot and other problems. Instead, aim to give your tree a thorough watering once or twice a week, depending on the climate and weather conditions. Finally, repotting is a must-do task for trees that are growing too big for their current containers. Ideally, you should repot your tree every two to three years to give it enough room to spread its roots and grow healthier. Use a high-quality potting mix and a container that’s slightly larger than the previous one. Be gentle when repotting, and avoid damaging the roots or branches. By following these essential tree care tips, you can help your tree stay strong, healthy, and beautiful for many years to come. Remember to be patient and consistent with your care routine, and your tree will reward you with its beauty and resilience."},{"instruction":"Question: What does Digimon stand for?

Prater, who currently plays for the Arizona Cardinals, kicked a 64-yard field goal while playing for the Denver Broncos on December 8, 2013, during a game against the Tennessee Titans. The kick broke the previous record of 63 yards, which was shared by four players. Prater's record-breaking kick was no easy feat. Not only did he have to make the long distance attempt, but he also had to contend with the altitude of Sports Authority Field at Mile High, which is known for helping kicks travel farther. Nonetheless, Prater – who had previously kicked a 59-yard field goal earlier in the game – made the kick with room to spare, sealing the Broncos' 51-28 victory. Since Prater's record-setting kick, a number of other kickers have come close to matching it, but none have been able to surpass it. The longest field goal kicked since 2013 is a 63-yard attempt by two players: Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens in 2018 and Graham Gano of the Carolina Panthers in 2018. While the ability to make long field goals is a valuable asset for any kicker, accuracy and consistency are just as important. Even the most talented kickers face pressure and difficult situations, and knowing when to make a kick and when to pass is key.

Graph the line on a coordinate plane. Draw the line. Shade in the appropriate area.","output":"To solve for y, we need to have an equation that includes y. This equation could be in the form of y = mx + b, where m and b are constants. Once we have the equation, we can easily find the value of y for a given x. To graph the line on a coordinate plane, we need to plot at least two points on the line. If we have the equation in the form of y = mx + b, we can use the intercept, b, to plot the first point. For example, if b = 3, the point (0, 3) would be on the line. We can then use the slope, m, to find another point. The slope tells us how much y changes for every 1 unit of x. For example, if m = 2, we can go up 2 units for every 1 unit to the right. We can then connect these two points to form the line. Once we have the line graphed, we can shade in the appropriate area. This may depend on the context of the problem. For example, if we are graphing a linear inequality, we would shade the area above or below the line depending on the direction of the inequality symbol. If we are graphing a system of equations, we would shade in the area where the lines intersect. Overall, graphing a line and shading in the appropriate area can help us visualize equations and inequalities. It allows us to better understand the relationship between variables and make predictions based on the information presented."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: The Wolverine has grossed 307 million worldwide.
