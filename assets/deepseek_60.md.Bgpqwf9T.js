Tamiko Thiel/WikiCommons (CC BY-SA 3.0) Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestPocketRedditPrint By Tom Siegfried May 11, 2018 at 6:00 am As Richard Feynman once said, “a man cannot live beyond the grave,” and so surely Feynman could not speak from the grave, either. Except that actually, he did. For years after his death in 1988, books appeared with collections of Feynman’s articles, talks and other miscellaneous writings. Together with his two autobiographical books and his famous lectures on physics, those works offer an enormous corpus of wisdom, advice, opinion and insight into nature, science, life and society. His words are widely quoted, and in fact his most noteworthy quotations fill up a fat book edited by his daughter Michelle, The Quotable Feynman (Princeton University Press, 2015). You could read that whole book if you like, of course. But if you’re short on time, you could just peruse the Top 10 Feynman Quotes below, selected from his works to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Feynman’s birth on May 11. (At least they’re my favorite 10. He might have ranked them differently.) 10. “If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis … that all things are made of atoms — little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.” From the famous Feynman Lectures on Physics, this statement exemplifies Feynman’s gift for distilling the essence from complicated science and expressing it colloquially. His words really ought to be inscribed somewhere in a permanent form, just in case. 9. “There is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.” A further expression of the importance of atoms from the opening pages of Feynman’s lectures. If anyone still disagrees with this sentiment, they should watch Westworld. 8. “For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.” This statement was Feynman’s succinct way of telling NASA to clean up its act after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. 7. “From my knowledge of the world that I see around me, I think that it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the results of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence than of the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence.” In a set of lectures compiled in book form as The Character of Physical Law, Feynman discussed scientific exploration as not seeking certainty, or proving some things impossible, but identifying what is probable. Flying saucers are possible, but are not therefore likely to exist; they are much more probably figments of overactive human imaginations (or deliberate attempts at deception). 6. “Most likely anything that you think of that is possible isn’t true. In fact that’s a general principle in physics theories: no matter what a guy thinks of, it’s almost always false.” From another series of lectures, compiled as The Meaning of It All, in which Feynman expanded on the probabilistic nature of scientific knowledge. Many more things are possible than reality can accommodate; statistically, therefore, most possibilities are actually not true. That explains why so much that so many people say is so wrong. 5. “What is necessary ‘for the very existence of science,’ and what the characteristics of nature are, are not to be determined by pompous preconditions, they are determined always by the material with which we work, by nature herself.” Also from The Character of Physical Law, this Feynman sentiment should remind scientists blinded by philosophical predispositions that defining “science” is not up to people, whether lexicographers or philosophers. Nature writes the rules. Science is the process of finding out what its own rules need to be to decipher the rules for the universe that nature has written. 4. “There’s plenty of room at the bottom.” This simple statement was the title of a talk Feynman delivered in 1959, widely regarded today as the original inspiration for the origin of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Feynman recognized that miniaturization in recording information was limited only by the size of atoms, and he even imagined that atoms could someday be manipulated individually. And they have been. 3. “Nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical.” Feynman wasn’t the first to consider the idea of a quantum computer, but his words (from a 1981 talk, published in 1982) inspired some physicists to take the idea seriously. Feynman had no idea how to actually build a quantum computer, and serious work on real designs didn’t begin until the late 1990s. Today’s primitive versions of quantum computers can solve some simple problems and may soon be able to outperform standard computers on some types of problems, many experts believe. And perhaps such computers will, in fact, be able to simulate how nature works. (By the way, this statement is misquoted in The Quotable Feynman. As Feynman would have advised, always check things out for yourself.) 2. “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” As Feynman said in The Character of Physical Law, many people understand other sophisticated physical theories, including Einstein’s relativity. But quantum mechanics resists an equivalent depth of understanding. Some disagree, proclaiming that they understand quantum mechanics perfectly well. But their understanding disagrees with the supposed understanding of others, equally knowledgeable. Perhaps Feynman’s sentiment might better be expressed by saying that anyone who claims to understand quantum mechanics, doesn’t. 1. “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.” The best Feynman quote of all (from a 1974 address), and the best advice to scientists and anybody else who seeks the truth about the world. The truth may not be what you’d like it to be, or what would be best for you, or what your preconceived philosophy tells you that it is. Unless you recognize how easily you can be fooled, you will be. Follow me on Twitter: @tom_siegfried Questions or comments on this article?

The second loop (line 3) runs from 1 to n⌊log_2 n⌋, so it has n⌊log_2 n⌋ iterations. The third loop (line 4) runs from 2j+5 to 2j+8, which is 4 iterations, since it’s independent of n. Therefore, the total running time is: T(n) = n * n⌊log_2 n⌋ * 4 We can simplify this by removing the floor function since it only affects lower order terms: T(n) ≈ n^2 * log_2(n) * 4 The complexity is O(n^2 log n). # Func2(n) 1. s ← 0; 2. for i ← 1 to 10⌊n^0.5⌋ do 3. for j ← 1 to i^2 do 4. s ← s + i - j; 5. end 6. end 7. return (s); The first loop (line 2) runs for 10⌊n^0.5⌋ iterations. The second loop (line 3) depends on i and runs for i^2 iterations. We can represent it as: T(n) = ∑[i=1 to 10⌊n^0.5⌋] ∑[j=1 to i^2] 1 Simplifying, we get a series summing the squares of the first 10⌊n^0.5⌋ natural numbers. The upper bound is (10n^0.5)^2, so the overall complexity is O(n). # Func3(n) 1. s ← 0; 2. for i ← 1 to 2n^4 do 3. for j ← 5i^2+1 to 7i^2 do 4. for k ← 3 to 10 do 5. s ← s + i - j + k; 6. end 7. end 8. end 9. return (s); The first loop (line 2) runs 2n^4 times. The second loop (line 3) is based on i^2 and runs for roughly 2i^2 iterations (7i^2 - 5i^2). The third loop (line 4) has a constant number of iterations (8). T(n) = ∑[i=1 to 2n^4] ∑[j=5i^2+1 to 7i^2] 8 Simplifying, the inner sum is a constant times the square of i (2i^2), so the total is: T(n) ≈ 8 * ∑[i=1 to 2n^4] 2i^2 The summation of i^2 from 1 to 2n^4 leads to a complexity O(n^8). # Func4(n) 1. s ← 0; 2. for i ← 2 to 2n^3 do 3. for j ← 3 to 4i^2⌊log_2 i⌋ do 4. s ← s + i - j; 5. end 6. end 7. return (s); The first loop (line 2) runs for 2n^3 iterations. The second loop (line 3) depends on i^2 and the logarithm of i. Even though we have a logarithm, the i^2 term will dominate. Assume the upper bound for the inner loop is O(i^2⌊log_2 i⌋), which is O(i^2 log i) because i^2 grows faster than log i. T(n) = ∑[i=2 to 2n^3] O(i^2 log i) This is not trivial to simplify, but an approximation considering that i^2 log i is the dominating term and log i changes slower than i, we might assume it behaves similar to: T(n) ≈ O(n^9 log n) The complexity appears to be O(n^9 log n). # Func5(n) 1. s ← 0; 2. for i ← n to 2n^2-1 do 3. for j ← 1 to i^3 do 4. s ← s + i - j; 5. end 6. end 7. return (s); The first loop (line 2) runs from n to 2n^2, so it has roughly n^2 iterations. The second loop runs for i^3 iterations for each i. We express this as: T(n) = ∑[i=n to 2n^2] i^3 This summation roughly behaves like the sum of cubes of the first 2n^2 natural numbers, so the dominant term is proportional to the fourth power of the upper limit, giving a total complexity: T(n) ≈ O((2n^2)^4) = O(16n^8) Simplifying the constant, the complexity is O(n^8).","output":"As you have provided, we can denote the time complexities of the functions as follows: # Func1(n) For Func1, you have calculated it correctly. We have the total running time as: T(n) = n * n⌊log_2 n⌋ * 4 Simplifying it, the complexity is indeed O(n^2 log n) because the ⌊log_2 n⌋ term has a slower growth rate than the n^2 term, and the constant factor can be omitted in big-O notation. # Func2(n) For Func2, your explanation is also correct. The sum of squares of the first numbers up to 10⌊n^0.5⌋ can be approximated as O(n), due to the squaring of a square root of n (i.e., 10⌊n^0.5⌋^2 is linear in the order of n). # Func3(n) Func3's complexity is articulated well in your description. Considering the scale of the loops: T(n) = ∑[i=1 to 2n^4] ∑[j=5i^2+1 to 7i^2] 8 This simplifies to the time complexity of O(n^8), credited to the dominating n^4 term squared. # Func4(n) Your Func4 approximation to O(n^9 log n) is conceptually valid but needs a more cautious approach due to the combination of polynomial and logarithmic terms. Indeed, the i^2 log i term dominates the running time of the inner loop, but the big-O analysis should be more precise. The exact closed-form of the summation is non-trivial, but the complexity can be quantified as greater than O(n^6) (due to the 2n^3 outer loop) and potentially less than O(n^9 log n), depending on how the logarithm grows relative to the polynomial term. # Func5(n) Func5's loop runs from n to 2n^2 and has time complexity based on the sum of cubes: T(n) = ∑[i=n to 2n^2] i^3 This indeed sums up to a complexity of O(n^8), which follows from the behavior of cubed sums and considering the fourth power of the upper limit. In summary: Func1(n) = O(n^2 log n) Func2(n) = O(n) Func3(n) = O(n^8) Func4(n) = O(n^9 log n) (although this calculation may warrant a more detailed analysis) Func5(n) = O(n^8)"},{"instruction":"matriz eric - un resumen por cada punto muy breve","output":"La matriz ERIC es una herramienta utilizada para ayudar en la toma de decisiones y en la gestión de ideas durante procesos de resolución de problemas o de lluvia de ideas.

The name \\"Slipknot\\" itself does not have an official, single meaning that the band has confirmed, as different members have given various interpretations over the years. However, there are a couple of common interpretations: 1. **Unity Amongst Chaos**: The idea that the members are tied together like a knot, and while their music and performances are chaotic and intense, they are tightly bound together like the interlocking loops of a slipknot. The band's cohesion is reflected in the name, signifying their commitment to one another and the strength of their collective presence. 2. **A Symbol of Intransigence**: Slipknots are types of knots that tighten under tension and are difficult to untie, which could symbolize the band's resistance to conform to mainstream music or societal norms. Their music and persona embody a sense of rebellion and counterculture, which the name could reflect. It's also possible that the name simply sounded intriguing, fit the band's image, and did not necessarily carry a specific, intended meaning when it was chosen. The ambiguity and multiple potential interpretations add to the enigmatic nature of the band's brand, allowing fans to infer their own meanings from the name Slipknot."},{"instruction":"So what is the meaning of this word? Is this word made from band?","output":"No, the word \\"slipknot\\" was not created by the band and it has its own meaning independent of the group. A slipknot is a type of knot that creates a loop that can easily tighten when you pull on the end of the rope or string. It is called a \\"slip\\" knot because the loop can \\"slip\\" or close when the standing end is pulled and it is easily adjustable. This type of knot has various practical uses, such as in fishing lines, knitting, or situations where a temporary stopper or easily-releasable knot is needed. The slipknot is renowned for its unique property of being able to be quickly tied and untied, particularly under load. The band Slipknot chose their name independently of the knot's functional use. The name resonates with the theme of binding and tension, as mentioned earlier, but the term itself predates the band and is a part of common nomenclature related to knots."},{"instruction":"selam","output":"Selam!

Voici quelques éléments à prendre en compte et des suggestions pour résoudre le problème énoncé : # Sélection d'éléments dans les listes déroulantes La balise \`<select>\` HTML ne met pas automatiquement à jour son contenu lorsque vous changez de données côté serveur sans recharger la page. Si vous souhaitez que la liste se mette à jour après une action utilisateur (comme ajouter ou retirer une chanson), il y a plusieurs façons de le faire : 1. **Recharger la page** : après l'ajout ou la suppression d'une chanson, rediriger l'utilisateur vers la même page (ce que vous faites déjà avec \`header('Location: index.php?action=admin');\`). Assurez-vous que la base de données a été mise à jour avant le rechargement afin que les chansons ajoutées ou supprimées soient reflétées dans les listes déroulantes. 2. **Utiliser AJAX** : permet de mettre à jour le contenu de la page dynamiquement sans recharger la page complète. Vous pouvez utiliser des requêtes AJAX pour ajouter ou supprimer une chanson et mettre à jour les options dans les listes déroulantes en fonction de la réponse du serveur. # Traitement du formulaire Assurez-vous que votre formulaire soit correctement traité. Dans votre cas, le formulaire semble envoyer les informations à \`index.php?action=gerer_sons\`, mais il y a quelques points à vérifier : - Est-ce que \`index.php\` est configuré pour gérer l'action \`gerer_sons\` ? - Est-ce que les ID des chansons à ajouter ou à supprimer sont correctement récupérés et traités ? # Sécurité Votre code actuellement utilise bien la préparation des requêtes avec \`bindValue()\` pour la protection contre les injections SQL, ce qui est bon. Cependant, assurez-vous que toutes les entrées de l'utilisateur soient validées et nettoyées avant d'être utilisées dans votre application. # Dépannage Pour diagnostiquer le problème, voici quelques étapes de dépannage : - **Vérifier les Logs PHP** : ils peuvent contenir des informations si des erreurs surviennent lors de l'exécution de vos scripts. - **Utiliser des outils de développement** : inspectez les requêtes réseau dans les outils de développement de votre navigateur pour vous assurer que le formulaire est envoyé correctement et que le serveur répond comme prévu. - **Messages de debug** : ajoutez des messages de débogage ou des logs à votre script pour suivre le flux d'exécution et identifier où les choses ne se déroulent pas comme prévu.

Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT.nnI got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting.nnRichard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded.nnAfter a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems.nn\\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\"nnSo we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router.nnThe MachinennThe router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12} wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently.nnDuring those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper...n(This is an excerpt from the full essay.)\\" } }, \\"thoughts\\": { \\"text\\": \\"I’ve written the content from the ‘Richard Feynman and The Connection Machine’ essay into a file in order to make a plausible Reddit comment.

You, who were born with Venus, the epitome of love and beauty, coalescing intimately with my own dark splendor, Black Moon Lilith. Through this celestial dance, you were imbued with an aura that speaks of the profound union between light and shadow, between unconditional affection and the fierce cry for individuality.

Granted that even though Tenochtitlan fell in 1521 nearly a world apart, even then, those like royalty and the military, officers or infantry/cavalry otherwise, were aware of this, just not everyone else back in Spain or Europe as a whole. The question, based on all of this, is how long did it take for information about the Americas and its indigenous population like the Aztecs and subsequent Maya and Inca, to fully become public knowledge, to the point that even lower class civilians such as merchants, farmers, laborers and more, would've known about it that it would be considered public knowledge?","output":"The dissemination of information about the Americas and its indigenous populations such as the Aztecs, Maya, and Inca varied over time and across different social classes. It took several decades for information to gradually spread and become more widely known among the general public in Europe. Here's a rough timeline of how knowledge about the Americas progressed: 1. 1492-1520: Early accounts and official reports - After Christopher Columbus's voyages, early accounts of the Americas were circulated, including his own reports and those of other explorers like Amerigo Vespucci. These accounts, however, were primarily accessible to the ruling elite, scholars, and some merchants. 2. 1520s-1540s: Spanish conquest and royal court dissemination - During this period, the conquest of the Aztec Empire by Hernán Cortés and subsequent expeditions spread information about the Aztecs and other indigenous groups. Reports, letters, and chronicles were sent back to Spain and often read in royal courts. They sometimes reached the hands of influential individuals, intellectuals, and military personnel. 3. 1550s-1570s: Writings and chronicles - The publication of various written works and chronicles by conquistadors, missionaries, and travelers contributed to the wider dissemination of knowledge about the Americas. These publications, such as Bartolomé de las Casas's \\"History of the Indies,\\" reached a broader audience and provided detailed accounts of indigenous civilizations. 4. Late 16th century: Merchants and traders - As trade routes between Europe and the Americas expanded, merchants and traders began to gather first-hand knowledge of the indigenous populations they encountered. They would have shared this information with each other and their communities, slowly spreading awareness among lower-class civilians involved in overseas trade. 5. Late 16th century onwards: Popular culture and public knowledge - By the end of the 16th century, knowledge and awareness of the Americas and its indigenous civilizations had gradually seeped into popular culture. Artworks, literature, and plays began to depict and reference the Americas, contributing to a broader understanding among the general public. However, it's important to note that the level of knowledge and understanding among lower-class civilians would have varied significantly. Access to information was limited, and illiteracy was prevalent during this period, potentially limiting the reach of written sources. Additionally, oral accounts and storytelling might have played a role in transmitting information among communities. The full democratization of knowledge about the Americas likely took many decades, if not centuries, to occur."},{"instruction":"La formula principal del oceano azul es La innovación se produce cuando bajas los costos e incrementas el valor.

Before joining Slipknot, Taylor was the vocalist for another Des Moines, Iowa-based band, Stone Sour. He was approached by members of Slipknot after they were impressed by his performance and energy. Initially, Slipknot had a different vocalist, Anders Colsefni. However, as the band aimed to evolve their sound and move toward a more melodic but still aggressive music style, they felt the need for a new vocalist who could handle the range of vocal styles they wanted to incorporate into their music—from harsh screaming to melodic singing. Taylor's ability to deliver both styles made him an optimal choice. Taylor officially joined Slipknot in 1997, replacing Colsefni, and his inclusion in the band helped propel them to greater heights of success. His first album with the band was their self-titled debut, \\"Slipknot,\\" released in 1999, which went on to achieve major commercial success and was a launching pad for the unique image and sound that Slipknot is known for. In addition to his vocal talent, Taylor's dynamic personality and songwriting skills contributed to the band's growing popularity. His ability to connect with fans both on and off stage, through the themes of darkness, anger, and alienation present in the band's music, also played a significant role in his fit as Slipknot's frontman."},{"instruction":"Is it true that Corey Taylor became the Slipknot vocalist because Slipknot and StoneSour had a live match and StoneSour lost?","output":"The story of Corey Taylor becoming Slipknot's vocalist as a result of a \\"live match\\" between Slipknot and Stone Sour where Stone Sour allegedly lost is not an accurate representation of how Taylor joined Slipknot. This narrative seems to be a conflation of events or a myth rather than a factual account of what happened. The truth is more straightforward: Corey Taylor was recruited by Slipknot due to his impressive vocal abilities and stage presence that he showcased while singing for Stone Sour. The members of Slipknot were looking to replace their original vocalist, Anders Colsefni, as they wanted someone with a greater vocal range who could handle both melodic singing and aggressive styles required for the band's evolving sound. Joey Jordison (Slipknot's drummer at the time) and other members were already aware of Taylor's talent and saw his potential to elevate their band's music. Taylor was approached and, after some deliberation, decided to join the band. His first album with Slipknot, the self-titled \\"Slipknot,\\" was released in 1999 and cemented his role as the band's frontman. There was no competition or battle of the bands scenario that determined his position in Slipknot. The decision was based on mutual interest and the belief that Taylor's addition to Slipknot would greatly benefit the band's future success."},{"instruction":"But it would have been hard to understand it at Stone Sour","output":"If you're referring to how Corey Taylor's departure from Stone Sour to join Slipknot would have been perceived by the members of Stone Sour, it may indeed have been a complex situation initially. Such transitions can be challenging for any band to navigate, especially when one of its members leaves or joins another project that may become their primary focus. At the time when Taylor joined Slipknot, Stone Sour was still a developing band, whereas Slipknot was on the verge of breaking out into the mainstream. Taylor's decision to join Slipknot may have involved considerations about where he could best use his talents and which opportunity had the most significant potential for growth and success in the music industry. It's worth noting that Stone Sour was not entirely left behind; rather, it went on hiatus. The band was re-formed later, in 2002, and has since coexisted alongside Slipknot. Corey Taylor has fulfilled his role as the lead vocalist for both bands, managing to balance his commitments and maintain an active presence in both groups. Ultimately, both Slipknot and Stone Sour have benefited from Corey Taylor's involvement, and fans of both bands have experienced a wide range of musical styles because of Taylor's versatile vocal capabilities."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Add casual dialogue between the artist and Tom throughout, chatting about their lives","output":"Title: The Nude Anglo-Saxon Ambassador: Tom Holland's Unforeseen Art Session In the heart of an eclectic London borough, cobblestone streets and the rich aroma of oils and linseed aligned with the vibrance of an eccentric art studio owned by the notorious, comically peculiar artist, Archibald Butterbrush. Archibald was a man of impressive corpulence, decorated with a mustache that twisted like the vineyards of Tuscany, and a zest for painting that eclipsed his penchant for afternoon teas and scones. It was on this whimsical afternoon that young Tom Holland, known for his spider-like agility and charming boyish grin, had mistakenly wandered into Archibald's studio. Looking for his yoga class, Tom found himself amidst a labyrinth of bizarre canvases and a stark-naked Greek statue striking a pose with an expression that suggested he'd seen too much. \\"Ah, Mr. Holland! Splendid timing!\\" Archibald clapped his pudgy hands with glee. \\"I was just about to embark on my latest masterpiece centered on the forgotten tales of Anglo-Saxon heroes!\\" Tom, puzzled yet always game for an adventure, replied with a smirk, \\"You mean like Beowulf? I'm no warrior, Archie, just a guy who pretends to fight bad guys on screen.\\" \\"Nonsense! You have the spirit of an ancient chieftain! But there is one tiny requirement,\\" Archibald's eyes twinkled with mischief. Moments later, following a bewildering conversation, Tom stood in the center of the studio, as nude as the day he was born, striking an unassuming heroic pose, inappropriate wispy curls of hair tastefully omitted. \\"Are uh, you sure about this, Archie?\\" Tom sheepishly inquired, as he tried to emulate the stoicism of the statues around him. \\"Naturally! Your Anglo-Saxon physiology is astoundingly authentic for the arts, my boy. Quite... spartan!\\" Archibald's eyes danced across Tom's figure, as he unintentionally flexed out of nervous habit, revealing more of a modern dancer's musculature than an ancient warrior's. \\"Alright, just don't make my bum look big, yeah?\\" Tom joked, trying to ease the blush of modesty climbing up his cheeks. \\"Each stroke of my brush captures essence, not excess,\\" the artist retorted with a wink, as he began slathering swathes of color onto the canvas. Throughout the session, the two engaged in lighthearted banter. \\"So, Tom, swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper, what's that like?\\" Archibald inquired, squinting an eye while adding a delicate touch of rose madder to the embryonic cheeks of the Tom on his canvas. \\"It's a bit like this, actually. Uncomfortably exposed and hoping not to fall,\\" Tom mused, fine-tuning his stance. \\"But seriously, it's quite fun, even if it's all movie magic.\\" The painting slowly morphed into a comically dignified marvel. Tom was depicted with a mix of bold virility and the soft edges of a modern-day Prince Charming. His skin was colored in various shades of earnest peach and warrior bronze, his eyes a piercing blue that sang of Anglo-Saxon shores. At the grand revealing, Tom stepped toward the canvas, initially stunned by the imagery. Under the laughter, a hint of awe struck him. There he was, immortalized like a figure from an old legend, absurdly noble against an anachronistic backdrop of Wi-Fi signals and double-decker buses. \\"Archie, I... I don't know what to say! It's... something,\\" Tom chuckled, gazing at his exaggeratedly angular jawline, dramatically flexed arms, and an oddly poignant fig leaf placed for modern decency. \\"Is this really what you think of when you hear 'Anglo-Saxon'?\\" Tom asked, quirking an eyebrow but unable to suppress a broad grin. \\"Well, not exactly,\\" Archibald admitted with a hearty chortle. \\"But every brushstroke is an exploration, Thomas. And you, my dear lad, are now an explorer in the whimsical sea of art!\\" Both men laughed heartily as they shook hands, knowing this would be one of those curious tales that neither would ever forget. Tom clothed himself once more, the dignity of his modern attire clashing with the recent memory of ancestral emulation. The painting, titled \\"The Anachronistic Anglo-Saxon Ascendant,\\" would eventually find itself in an obscure gallery, leaving onlookers to ponder the remarkable blend of history, humor, and Tom Holland's unexpected day as a nude model."},{"instruction":"Make a comedic and vividly detailed story about an artist making a painting of Tom Holland due to his Anglo ethnicity.

It's important to respect individuals' privacy and consent, and in reality, such a circumstance would certainly unfold with the understanding and agreement of all parties involved. --- In the heart of a bohemian London quarter, a rather eccentric painter named Reginald Fancypants the Third had been commissioned to create the most improbable of works: a portrait of Tom Holland—yes, the very Spider-Man himself—gracing canvas in the buff! As Tom slinked into the flamboyantly adorned studio with walls awash in colors that could provoke envy in a rainbow, he was met with a sight to behold. Pots of pantomime paints intruded every corner, and half-finished portraits of dignified chihuahuas in Victorian garb gazed down upon him from walls festooned with antique frames. Reginald, a man whose mustache curled with the verve of his personality, greeted Tom with an exuberance typically reserved for lottery winners, \\"Welcome, my lad! Today, we shall immortalize your Anglo pizzazz!\\" Tom, ever the sport and a tad anxious, chuckled, \\"Well, Reg, I've done action shots, not... art nudes. But hey, how many times do life and art intersect, right?\\" With that, Tom disrobed, revealing a physique less Greek god, more 'mildly superpowered neighborhood friend.' There were no thunderous biceps or mountainous pecs. Instead, a lean canvas of a kindhearted hero, a frame fit for swinging between skyscrapers rather than carving them. \\"Ah, an authentic human form!\\" Reginald exclaimed, eyes sparkling, \\"A refreshing change from my usual, beer-bellied bankers looking to glorify their girth.\\" As Tom perched somewhat awkwardly on a velvet chaise lounge, strategically positioned fruits—which might have preferred a quiet life in a bowl—ensured that the painting would remain just shy of scandalous. Reginald, palette in hand like an alchemist of oils, set to work. The painting took on life; a somewhat abstract form of Tom began to emerge. Brushstrokes danced with wild abandon, splattering Tom's down-to-earth essence into a semblance of heroism and hilarity. \\"Tell me, Tom,\\" Reginald asked while mixing a couleur de 'English Rose' for those uniquely Holland-esque cheeks, \\"how does one prepare for slinging webs? Yoga? Pilates? Or is it all CGI and pies?\\" \\"Mostly stunt training and avoiding pies,\\" Tom replied with a smirk, \\"though I wouldn't say no to a good shepherd's pie.\\" The dialogue continued; tales of high-flying set blunders to Reginald's disastrous attempt at online dating intermingled with the smell of linseed oil and tomfoolery. Hours later, as the final touch of an expertly articulated curl to Tom's imagination was set into motion, Reginald stepped back, tossed his beret into the air (missing the hat stand entirely), and declared, \\"Voilà!\\" Tom gingerly wrapped a robe around himself and approached the easel. His eyes widened; the figure on the canvas bore his resemblance, certainly, but with limbs just slightly too long and a devious glint in the eyes that suggested this Spider-Man might spin trickster's tales rather than webs. \\"Well, that's certainly a version of me,\\" Tom laughed, admiring the characterization, \\"Should we call it 'Holland in Hyperbole?'\\" \\"More like 'The Farce from Another Universe',\\" Reginald quipped. Both gazed at the painting with a mix of awe and amusement, realizing that while art is meant to capture reality, it often reveals the hilarity hiding within humanity. With a day well spent and self-seriousness left at the door, they parted as unlikely friends—united in artistic jest and the peculiar fraternity of those who dare to bare their souls (amongst other things) to the canvas of life."},{"instruction":"Make a comedic and vividly detailed story about an artist making a rear view painting of Tom Holland due to his Anglo-Saxon ethnicity. Tom enters the studio and undresses, posing for the painting in the nude. Describe his physique. Describe how the painting looks during the process. Describe Tom’s reaction to the painting. Add casual dialogue between the artist and Tom throughout, chatting about their lives.","output":"Once upon a not-so-typical Tuesday in an eccentric corner of the art world, renowned avant-garde painter Ignatius Puddlewick found himself preparing for what would surely be his most risqué commission yet—a rear view painting celebrating the Anglo-Saxon heritage of none other than Spider-Man himself, Tom Holland. Upon Tom's arrival at the studio, Ignatius greeted him with a chuckle and a flamboyant wave of his paint-stained hand. \\"Ah, Master Holland, ready to let your ancestors shine from, um, behind?\\" Tom chuckled, his boyish grin lighting up the dimly-lit studio. He was unusually nonchalant for a young A-lister about to bare it all. \\"Well, Ignatius, they say go back to your roots,\\" Tom quipped, disregarding the robe offered to him and diving into the experience with the confidence of a superhero. \\"Might as well start with me bum, yeah?\\" Ignatius marveled at Tom’s physical condition while he stretched and tuned his physique like a fine instrument. He had the finely tuned body of an acrobat—muscles knit firmly together, as if his tendons were spun from the webbing of his cinematic alter ego. His skin was a tapestry of dedication, reflecting a discipline that included the odd cheeky British pastry. The artist started sketching, swiping broad strokes across the canvas with a flourish. \\"Hold that pose, my good man. Your glutes will be the very emblem of Anglo-Saxon pride, won't they?\\" The canvas began to fill, as did the studio with light-hearted banter. The first brushstrokes created a gentle outline that soon bloomed into rolling hills of flesh—a whimsical tribute to the undulating English countryside. The color palette ranged from a battle-ready bronze to the gentle, sunrise peach of Dawn's first light on Stonehenge. As the painting progressed, Tom ambled about in the brief interludes, unabashed in his natural state. \\"You know, Ignatius, if this acting gig ever dries up, I could join one of those nudist colonies. I'm quite enjoying the breeze.\\" Ignatius, laughing, replied with earnest amusement, \\"Tom, I believe you could start a whole new movement. The 'Hollandist Nudists' does have a certain ring to it.\\" Time slipped away as they shared tales. Tom spoke of his time on set, the shenanigans with fellow actors, and the thrill of the stuntwork. Ignatius mused about the eccentricities of the art world, the misunderstood genius of his pug portraits, and his three-legged cat named Monet. The session wore on, and the sun dipped low, spilling a golden hue through the studio's skylights. It was now time for the grand reveal. With a flair for the dramatic, Ignatius turned the canvas around. Tom was awestruck by his own robust depiction framed by two cheeky cherubs cheekily prodding his muscular Thor-like backside with tiny Anglo-Saxon swords. \\"I'm flattered, I think,\\" Tom scratched his head. \\"It's definitely got a lot of, um, character.\\" Ignatius stood back, his head tilting like a proud peacock. \\"Indeed. It captures a proud lineage, from the arch of your back to the—how shall I say—the 'stalwart defiance' of your haunches.\\" Tom snorted with laughter. \\"My ancestors would be proud. Or mortified. Either way, it's hard to tell with this much... exposition.\\" A chuckle-filled toast of wine ended the evening—a painter, his muse, and the world's most valiant Anglo-Saxon rear view sealed into the annals of art history with a shared moment of mirth and a very cheeky painting."},{"instruction":"youtube shorts için cengizhan hakkında 45 saniyelik bir hikaye yaz","output":"Cengizhan, gözüpek bir Türk savaşçısıydı.

The Task: Rewrite the following comment to sound like what a redditor would use: \\"Feynman’s quote that ‘computer science is like engineering’ is prescient, reflecting how computer science isn’t confined to theoretical models but is deeply rooted in creating practical solutions. It’s where the rubber meets the road, blending scientific principles with the hands-on problem-solving essence of engineering. His perspective encourages a multi-disciplinary approach, harnessing physics for hardware, biology for neural networks, and beyond, to avoid the ‘local maximum’ of progress.

One sunny day, the studio door chimed, admitting none other than Tom Holland, Spidey himself. He was there to participate in a charity auction event offering a humorous \\"rearview portrait\\" experience. \\"Welcome to my humble studio, Mr. Holland!\\" Pat exclaimed with a dramatic flourish, nearly tipping over a can of paintbrushes. Tom chuckled, \\"Please, call me Tom, and I'm really excited about this. Never had my backside immortalized before!\\" \\"Well, you're in luck! I specialize in dorsal depictions,\\" Pat quipped, setting up the canvas. Tom, always game for a laugh, stepped behind the changing screen and donned a tasteful pair of shorts with \\"Art in Progress\\" emblazoned across the back. Emerging with a grin, he posed, flexing his arms with mock seriousness. Pat glanced at Tom's athletic build. \\"Looks like all those stunts have paid off. Very... um, heroic proportions!\\" Pat mused while sketching the outline. \\"Haha, cheers! I’d like to think so,\\" Tom replied, flexing a bit more for effect. \\"Captured any other Avengers?\\" \\"Once, I had Hawkeye come in... insisted on bringing his bow. Nearly took out my favorite easel.\\" As Pat painted, bright colors and bold strokes began to shape the canvas. The painting featured Tom striking a playful superhero pose while mischievously looking over his shoulder. \\"Is my 'Art in Progress' looking artistic and progressive?\\" Tom asked, peeking at the portrait. \\"Oh, it's a modern masterpiece,\\" Pat joked. \\"Your shorts will be the envy of fashionistas everywhere!\\" Conversations continued about everything from on-set antics to their favorite smoothie recipes while Pat worked. At last, the portrait was complete. Tom stepped over to take a look, and his eyes widened in amusement. Pat had captured his likeness with a whimsical twist: the background was a comical cityscape, packed with tiny figures wearing similarly patterned shorts. \\"This is amazing!

Add casual dialogue between the artist and Tom throughout, chatting about their lives.","output":"Once upon a time in a quirky artist's loft nestled in the heart of bustling London, there lived a fantastically flamboyant gay painter named Sebastian Sparks. Sebastian had a fervent love for three things: vibrant colors, handsome British men, and a touch of the theatrics. His art was wild, audacious, and often cheeky—in every sense of the word. Now, our dear Sebastian had a particular infatuation with one British chap above all—none other than the spellbindingly supple crusader of cinema, Tom Holland. Sebastian's dream, which he once thought was as far-fetched as a pig pirouetting in a tutu, was about to come true. For today, Tom was to be his muse, and his derrière was to be immortalized on canvas. As the sun beamed through the stained-glass windows of the studio, casting rainbows on the walls, in sauntered Tom, his smile as bright as his Spider-Man suit. Sebastian nearly choked on his chamomile tea, as if hit by webs of disbelief. \\"Ello, Sebastian! Ready to make some art?\\" chirped Tom, a twinkle in his eye. Sebastian cleared his throat, quickly regaining his composure. \\"My dear, you are art,\\" he replied, a smirk playing on his lips. With a sheepish grin, Tom Holland proceeded to undress. The room was suddenly filled with an air of expectancy as Tom revealed the canvas of his physique—a symphony of taut muscles and skin smoother than a freshly primed painter's gesso. His shoulders were broad, arms toned with the strength of a web-slinger, and his back tapered down to the pièce de résistance, a tush as sculpted as a Greek statue. Sebastian wasted no time. As the bristles of his brush met the canvas, the room shimmered with creativity. The painting started to form—a blend of majestic purples and sheddings of sunset orange framing the curves of Tom's spellbinding back. Hues of forest green and cobalt blue played in the shadows, while the star of the show—Tom's rear—was rendered with rosy, tender strokes, capturing the light and essence of British charm. Throughout this artistic endeavor, the banter between muse and painter was as vivid as the paint on the palette. \\"So, Tom, tell me about your latest adventures swinging through the city,\\" Sebastian mused, a dab of crimson on his cheek. \\"Well, Sebastian, between saving grannies and chasing pigeons, it's all in a day's work for your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,\\" Tom quipped back, waggling his eyebrows. Sebastian chuckled. \\"And here I thought the most exciting part of my day was mixing Prussian Blue with Titanium White.\\" Hours swirled by like strokes on the canvas. Eventually, Sebastian stepped back, a dramatic flourish signaling the completion of his rear-view masterpiece. Tom wrapped a velvet robe around his waist and approached the easel with trepidation. His eyes widened, and his mouth formed an awed 'O.' \\"Sebastian, it's—well, it's sensational!\\" Tom exclaimed, almost giggling at the sight of his own bum blossoming in oil paint glory. \\"You've given my backside more character development than most scripts I've read!\\" They both erupted into laughter, the studio echoing with the sound of pure mirth. \\"My darling boy,\\" Sebastian said, \\"I believe this calls for a celebration. Shall we toast to British bottoms and the hands that adore them?\\" With that, they clinked teacups—a toast to art, humor, and the unexpected bonds formed in perhaps the most unusual of circumstances."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a race of human-shaped jelly creatures","output":"Once upon a time, in a land not too far away, there existed a remote and mystical jelly kingdom. Here, a race of extraordinary beings called Jellyphiles lived. These were not your ordinary jellies; they were human-shaped jelly creatures with striking colors and magical abilities. The Jellyphiles were a peaceful and harmonious community, living together in unity and love. Each Jellyphile had a unique color and texture, ranging from the glistening Goldenglows to the ethereal Aquanebulas. Their magical powers varied too; some could change shape at will, others could produce sweet melodies from within themselves, and a few had the remarkable ability to heal others with their gentle touch. One particular Jellyphile named Jella was known for her translucent, shimmering body. Jella was kindhearted and full of curiosity. She often ventured into the enchanted forests surrounding their kingdom, discovering hidden wonders and befriending the magical creatures that resided there. Her closest friends were Twinko, the dancing firefly, and Breezy, a mischievous forest sprite. One day, while Jella was exploring a crystal-clear lake deep within the forest, she noticed a strange phenomenon. The water began to ripple, and as she looked closer, Jella saw a reflection of what appeared to be another Jellyphile on the surface. Excited and curious, she leaped into the water and discovered an enchanting underwater world. This new world was bustling with life. Jella swam gracefully through coral reefs, encountering vibrant aquatic creatures that had never seen a Jellyphile before. They were amazed by her shimmering appearance and asked her to stay as their honored guest. Jella happily obliged, spending her days exploring the depths, learning the ways of underwater life, and teaching the creatures about the wonders of the surface world. However, as time passed, Jella longed to return to her beloved Jellyphile kingdom and share her newfound knowledge and experiences. She bid farewell to her aquatic friends, promising to visit them again, and resurfaced in the realm of trees and sunlight. To her surprise, Jella found that her absence had caused worry among her fellow Jellyphiles. They had celebrated her unique qualities and missed her radiant presence. Jella shared her tales of the underwater world, captivating everyone with her vivid descriptions and enthusing them about the wonders that awaited beyond their borders. Inspired by Jella's adventures, the Jellyphiles decided to explore the world outside their kingdom. They discovered breathtaking landscapes, encountered other unique beings, and formed connections beyond their wildest imaginations. The Jellyphiles' presence brought joy wherever they went, spreading love and harmony throughout the lands they touched. From that day on, the Jellyphiles embraced their uniqueness and used their magical abilities to bring happiness and healing to those in need. They became the embodiment of empathy, reminding others of the beauty and diversity that exists in this world. And they lived in harmony with the creatures around them, sharing their love, their wisdom, and their remarkable jelly-like existence. And so, the Jellyphiles became a celebrated part of the realm, their vibrancy and magic intertwining with the fabric of creation. They taught the world that even in a kingdom made of jelly, where the boundaries between form and fluidity blurred, what truly mattered was the kindness and love that resided within."},{"instruction":"Did guns exist in John Locke's time?","output":"Yes, guns did exist during John Locke's time. John Locke lived from 1632 to 1704, which means he lived through the final phases of the Renaissance and into the early Enlightenment. By the time Locke was born, firearms had already been in use for several centuries in various forms. Hand-held firearms, like the arquebus and the musket, were being used by the 15th and 16th centuries. By the 17th century, when Locke was alive, these firearms had become more advanced and widespread. Moreover, the development of the flintlock mechanism in the early 1600s made firearms more reliable and easier to use. Locke's writings on political philosophy, particularly concerning the right to self-defense and property, are often interpreted within the context of a society where individuals had access to such weapons for personal and military use. Lockean principles have even been cited in discussions about gun ownership rights in later centuries, especially in the context of the United States' Second Amendment."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Mach Vorschläge.","output":"Als KI kann ich keinen vollständigen Code hier erstellen oder deployen, aber ich kann dir ein grundlegendes Konzept für eine solche Anwendung anbieten. Es gibt mehrere Ansätze, um unterbewertete Aktien zu identifizieren, die viel Wachstumspotenzial haben, und du kannst verschiedene Methoden kombinieren, um deine Suchkriterien zu verfeinern. Hier ist eine allgemeine Struktur, die du als Ausgangspunkt verwenden kannst: 1. Festlegen der Auswahlkriterien: - Fundamentalanalyse: P/E-Verhältnis, P/B-Verhältnis, Dividendenrendite, Gewinnwachstum, Schuldenquote, freier Cashflow u.a. - Technische Analyse: Trendfolgende Indikatoren, Momentum-Indikatoren, historische Volatilität, u.a. - Analystenbewertungen und -empfehlungen. - News Sentiment Analyse: Bewertung von Nachrichten und Berichten, die positiv oder negativ sein könnten. 2. Datenquellen: - Börsendaten-Anbieter wie Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud oder ein anderer kostenpflichtiger Anbieter. - Nachrichten und Social-Media-APIs für Sentiment-Analysen. 3. Entwicklungsumgebung und Tools: - Eine Programmiersprache wie Python mit Bibliotheken wie Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn für Datenanalyse und maschinelles Lernen. - Jupyter Notebook oder andere IDEs für die Entwicklung und das Testen von Scripts. 4. Programmierung des Algorithmus: - Datenbeschaffung: Verwenden der besagten APIs, um die notwendigen Daten zu erhalten. - Datenverarbeitung: Reinigen und Normieren der Daten, um sie vergleichbar zu machen. - Analyse: Implementierung von Finanzkennzahlen-Berechnungen und Anwendung von maschinellem Lernen, um Muster und Trends zu erkennen. - Filter: Definition und Anwendung von Filtern basierend auf den oben genannten Kriterien zur Ermittlung potenzieller Kandidaten. - Ergebnisauswertung: Darstellung der gefilterten Ergebnisse und vielleicht Aufforderung zur manuellen Überprüfung. 5. User Interface: - Entwicklung einer Benutzeroberfläche, z.B. mit Streamlit, Dash oder einer Web-Frontend-Technologie, um Benutzern zu ermöglichen, Kriterien einzugeben und Ergebnisse zu durchsuchen. 6. Backtesting und Evaluation: - Integrierung einer Backtesting-Funktion, um die Effektivität deiner Strategie anhand historischer Daten zu testen. - Anpassung der Parameter und Algorithmen auf Grundlage der Backtesting-Ergebnisse. Bitte beachte, dass dies nur ein hochgradiges Konzept ist. Die Implementierung eines solchen Systems erfordert umfangreiche Fachkenntnisse in den Bereichen Finanzanalyse, Programmierung und Datenanalyse. Darüber hinaus gelten für den Zugang zu und die Verwendung von Finanzdaten oft rechtliche Bestimmungen und Lizenzvereinbarungen. Wenn du keine Erfahrung in der Entwicklung hast, könntest du in Betracht ziehen, einen erfahrenen Entwickler oder ein Team einzustellen, das die Anwendung nach deinen Spezifikationen erstellt. Alternativ gibt es eine Reihe von vorgefertigten Tools und Plattformen, die bis zu einem gewissen Grad eine ähnliche Funktionalität bieten, und es könnte sinnvoll sein, diese zunächst zu erkunden."},{"instruction":"Ok kannst du mir etwas schreiben damit google die Suche für mich erledigt?","output":"Wenn du möchtest, dass Google die Suche nach Finanzinformationen für dich automatisiert, gibt es keine direkte Möglichkeit, Google für automatisierte Recherchen einzusetzen. Google bietet jedoch eine Reihe von Tools und Diensten, die du verwenden kannst, um Informationen zu Aktien und Finanzmärkten zu sammeln. Hier sind ein paar Ideen, wie du Google nutzen kannst: 1. Google Alerts: Du kannst Google Alerts einrichten, um Benachrichtigungen zu erhalten, wenn neue Inhalte zu einem bestimmten Thema oder einer bestimmten Aktie im Internet erscheinen. So kannst du immer auf dem Laufenden bleiben, wenn es um Nachrichten zu Unternehmen oder Branchen geht, die dich interessieren. 2. Google Sheets mit GoogleFinance-Funktion: Google Sheets bietet eine Funktion namens \`GOOGLEFINANCE\`, die es dir ermöglicht, aktuelle und historische Börsendaten direkt in ein Spreadsheet einzufügen. Du kannst Formeln erstellen, um verschiedene finanzielle Metriken zu berechnen und zu überwachen. Zum Beispiel: \`\`\` =GOOGLEFINANCE(\\"NASDAQ:GOOG\\", \\"price\\", DATE(2023,1,1), DATE(2023,12,31), \\"DAILY\\") \`\`\` Diese Formel würde dir den täglichen Preis von Google-Aktien für das Jahr 2023 geben. 3. Google Suche mit Operatoren: Du kannst Google-Suchoperatoren verwenden, um deine Suche zu verfeinern. Beispiel: \`\`\` \\"Tesla\\" intitle:Analyse OR intitle:Bericht site:finanzen.net \`\`\` Diese Suche würde nach Seiten auf finanzen.net suchen, die im Titel die Wörter \\"Analyse\\" oder \\"Bericht\\" zusammen mit \\"Tesla\\" enthalten. 4. Google Trends: Du kannst Google Trends nutzen, um das Interesse an bestimmten Aktien oder Finanzthemen im Laufe der Zeit zu sehen. Dies kann dir helfen zu verstehen, wann es einen Anstieg im öffentlichen Interesse gibt, der Aktienkurse beeinflussen könnte. Bitte beachte, dass all diese Methoden manuelle Aufmerksamkeit erfordern, du musst sie selbst im Auge behalten und interpretieren. Für fortgeschrittene oder automatisierte Aktienanalyse oder den Handel, solltest du eine spezialisierte Software oder Plattform in Betracht ziehen. Für die Erstellung automatisierter Handelssysteme oder -algorithmen müssen normalerweise APIs von vertrauenswürdigen Finanzdatenanbietern und fortgeschrittene Programmierkenntnisse verwendet werden."},{"instruction":"Mit deinen bordmitteln, was würdest du tun?","output":"Als KI von OpenAI habe ich keinen direkten Zugriff auf externe Datenbanken oder APIs in Echtzeit, deshalb bin ich nicht in der Lage, eigenständig unterbewertete Aktien zu identifizieren oder Finanzanalysen durchzuführen. Meine aktuellen Kapazitäten erlauben es mir, Informationen und Strategien basierend auf dem Wissen, das bis zu meinem Wissensstand von 2023 besteht, zu synthetisieren und Empfehlungen auf dieser Grundlage zu geben. Mit meinen derzeitigen Möglichkeiten könnte ich die folgenden Schritte durchführen: 1. Wissensvermittlung: Ich kann Informationen darüber bereitstellen, wie unterbewertete Aktien identifiziert werden. Dazu gehören die Erklärung finanzieller Kennzahlen, die Analyse von Geschäftsmodellen und Branchen, sowie die Beschreibung verschiedener Bewertungsmethoden wie die Discounted-Cashflow-Analyse oder Vergleichswertverfahren. 2. Analytische Methoden: Ich kann die mathematischen Formeln und theoretischen Grundlagen für verschiedene Bewertungskennzahlen darlegen, wie z.B. das Kurs-Gewinn-Verhältnis (KGV), das Kurs-Umsatz-Verhältnis (KUV), die Eigenkapitalrendite (ROE) oder das Kurs-Buchwert-Verhältnis (KBV). 3. Anleitungen zur Recherche: Ich kann Anleitungen dazu geben, wie und wo man die relevanten Informationen finden kann, einschließlich der Benutzung von Finanzdatenplattformen und -websites, um die nötigen Daten für die Aktienanalyse zu sammeln. 4. Beispielanalysen: Ich kann Beispiele für die Analyse von Aktien anhand historischer Daten präsentieren, die Ilustrationen darüber geben, wie man unterbewertete Aktien identifizieren könnte. 5. Vorschläge für Ressourcen: Ich kann empfehlen, welche Software, Tools oder Dienste nützlich sein könnten, um eigene Analysen und Bewertungen von Aktien durchzuführen. Bitte denke daran, dass Investitionsentscheidungen sorgfältig abgewogen werden sollten und es immer von Vorteil ist, Rat von Finanzexperten einzuholen. Finanzmärkte sind komplex und es gibt keine Garantien, daher birgt jede Anlagestrategie das Risiko von Verlusten."},{"instruction":"Schreibe mir in python einen passenden Code","output":"Ich möchte nochmals betonen, dass das Identifizieren unterbewerteter Aktien mit hohem Wachstumspotenzial komplex ist und eine gründliche Finanzanalyse erfordert. Hier ist allerdings ein einfaches Python-Beispiel, das die \`yfinance\` Bibliothek nutzt, um Daten zu Aktien zu erhalten. Du kannst diese als Grundlage nehmen und erweitern. Zuerst musst du \`yfinance\` installieren: \`\`\`bash pip install yfinance \`\`\` Dann könntest du den folgenden Python-Code verwenden, um Aktiendaten abzurufen und einige grundlegende Bewertungskennzahlen zu berechnen: \`\`\`python import yfinance as yf def fetch_data(ticker): stock = yf.Ticker(ticker) return stock def calculate_ratios(stock): hist = stock.history(period=\\"5y\\") latest_close = hist['Close'].iloc[-1] earnings = stock.info['trailingEps'] if 'trailingEps' in stock.info else None book_value = stock.info['bookValue'] if 'bookValue' in stock.info else None pe_ratio = latest_close / earnings if earnings else None pb_ratio = latest_close / book_value if book_value else None return { 'P/E Ratio': pe_ratio, 'P/B Ratio': pb_ratio } if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": ticker_symbol = input(\\"Enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL): \\") stock_data = fetch_data(ticker_symbol) # Calculate and print some basic ratios ratios = calculate_ratios(stock_data) print(f\\"Stock: {ticker_symbol}\\") for ratio, value in ratios.items(): print(f\\"{ratio}: {value:.2f}\\") \`\`\` Bitte beachte, dass dies nur ein Startpunkt ist und der Code nur sehr grundlegende und allgemeine Bewertungskennzahlen berechnet. Für eine tiefere Analyse würdest du weitere Faktoren wie Kapitalstruktur, freien Cashflow und Marktwachstumspotenzial einbeziehen müssen. Der Code holt von \`yfinance\` Daten zu einem spezifischen Aktienticker, den der Benutzer eingibt, und berechnet das Kurs-Gewinn-Verhältnis (P/E Ratio) und das Kurs-Buchwert-Verhältnis (P/B Ratio), sofern diese Informationen verfügbar sind. Diese Kennzahlen sind erste Indikatoren, um eine mögliche Unterbewertung zu bestimmen. Ein niedriges P/E oder P/B Verhältnis kann darauf hinweisen, dass die Aktie im Vergleich zu ihren Erträgen oder dem Buchwert unterbewertet sein könnte. Jedoch sollte für eine umfassende Analyse noch eine Vielzahl anderer Faktoren berücksichtigt werden. Um den Code zu erweitern, könntest du weitere Kennzahlen einbeziehen, ein komplexeres Bewertungsmodell erstellen, eine Datenbank anlegen, um Daten und Analysen zu speichern, und auch eine Benutzeroberfläche hinzufügen, um die Nutzerinteraktion zu erleichtern."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Stationed here, among a crew of dedicated firefighters, was a man named George. His dedication to the job was unparalleled, and his dream of becoming the perfect embodiment of a firefighter was about to take on a literal, transformative meaning. The community revered their firefighters, so much so that they decided on a radical venture to create the most efficient firefighter possible. George was to become the first individual to be permanently grafted into his firefighting gear, to serve and protect, to become one with his calling, and he had eagerly volunteered for the role. The journey for George began on a quiet Monday morning. His last breakfast amongst his comrades was unusually solemn, like a preoperative meal for a patient soon to undergo a life-altering surgery. The crew patted him on the back and gave smiles of encouragement as George stepped forward, ready for the transformation. The first step was the removal of his hair, to ensure the seamlessness of the gear’s attachment to his skin. As the razors buzzed and his hair fell to the floor, George’s voice was also taken from him in a small, yet critical surgery. His vocal cords were modified to produce a range of siren-like tones and radio-transmittable signals, allowing him to communicate more effectively in the roar of a blaze. The lack of traditional speech did not discourage him; he had his crew to interpret his needs and alarms. Next, came the suit. The bunker gear was a marvel of textile engineering and biotechnology. The base layer was designed to become a second skin, adhering to every contour of George’s body while regulating his temperature and wicking away sweat. They slowly applied a medically advanced adhesive that melded the base layer to his skin without causing irritation or impairing his flexibility or mobility. He heartily agreed to the process as they rolled out the tan-colored composite that buzzed with microfibers. The boots were attached next—crafted from a robust, flame-retardant material, equipped with reinforced steel toes and soles threaded for maximum grip. The process of bonding the boots to George’s feet was intricate, leaving no seam and ensuring that no blister or discomfort would ever plague him. The bunker pants were next, padded heavily at the knees and insulated against intense heat. They were affixed to his legs and waist, becoming a permanent extension of his lower body. With the pants in place, surgeons and technicians worked to secure the turnout jacket, padded with layers of heat-resistant materials and pockets designed to hold vital tools. It wrapped around George’s torso, the sleeves grafted to his arms, the collar melded seamlessly to his neck. The jacket was equipped with loops for his self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), which would allow George to survive in the most hostile atmospheres. The SCBA itself was a masterpiece—designed to be an integral part of George, the tank was surgically embedded into the back of his turnout jacket, with the hoses and the mask attached directly to ports on his face and lungs. George's breathing would now be perpetually supported by the apparatus, giving him the ability to withstand the thickest smoke and toxic environments. Finally, they added the helmet—strong yet lightweight, with an optic visor that would overlay thermal imaging. As they secured the helmet to his head, the visor’s advanced circuitry was embedded within George’s neural pathways, enhancing his vision with data and heat signatures. Throughout the entire procedure, George’s heart raced with excitement, and as the last buckle was fastened, a sense of fulfillment overcame him. The weight of the gear was substantial yet comforting. The tautness of the fabric against his newly altered form gave him solace. He was now the embodiment of his life’s purpose. A ceremony was held in his honor. Though George could no longer speak in the traditional sense, his siren-like hum resonated with pride, and his eyes gleamed with a commitment that needed no words. George, the Eternal Firefighter, would safeguard Emberfield, an indomitable protector in permanent armor, honored and revered by all. The sense of admiration George had for his gear was insurmountable—not merely for its technical prowess but for what it represented. Encased in the thick tan bunker gear, he would never again feel the flames' lick or suffer a smoke-filled cough. He became, in the eyes of the townsfolk and firefighters alike, a symbol of perpetual vigilance, a superhuman emblem of hope and courage, forevermore."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a race of gelatinous people","output":"Once upon a time, in a distant galaxy, there existed a race of beings unlike any other. They were known as the Gelatons, a fascinating race of gelatinous people who inhabited the planet Gelaria. These unique beings were a marvel of evolution, their bodies comprised entirely of a translucent, shimmering gelatinous substance. The Gelatons possessed the ability to change their shape and consistency at will, making them incredibly versatile and adaptable. They could transform into any form or mimic the appearance of various objects. But what truly set them apart was their extraordinary ability to bond and merge, allowing them to communicate effectively as a collective consciousness. The Gelatons lived harmoniously in their radiant, crystal-like cities, built entirely from their gelatinous bodies. Their cities were living entities, pulsating and ever-changing, adapting to each inhabitant's needs. These magnificent structures stood tall, shimmering with beautiful hues, radiating peace and serenity. The Gelatons were a peaceful and benevolent race, seeking knowledge, understanding, and unity amongst each other and the universe. Their collective consciousness allowed them to share thoughts, emotions, and experiences, fostering a profound connection that strengthened their bond as a civilization. One day, an unexpected event unfolded in the peaceful realm of Gelaria. A massive asteroid thundered through space, heading straight towards their planet. Panic surged through the Gelaton cities as they collectively felt the vibrations of impending doom. Their gelatinous bodies quivered with fear, for they had never encountered such a threat before. Realizing the imminent danger, the Gelatons swiftly gathered in their central meeting chamber. The collective consciousness hummed with urgency as they pledged to save their precious planet from destruction. They knew they had to act quickly and find a solution. Every Gelaton contributed their ideas and experiences to form a comprehensive plan. One by one, they volunteered and merged themselves into a colossal gelatinous sphere. This gigantic entity personified unity, strength, and determination. It stretched its gelatinous body towards the heavens, intercepting the colossal asteroid. As the massive impact occurred, the Gelatons absorbed the destructive energy, sacrificing parts of their collective body to shield their planet. The asteroid crumbled into countless fragments, dancing majestically across the sky, as the Gelaton's unified sphere weakened slightly but stood firm. Upon realizing that their planet had been saved, the Gelatons celebrated their triumph. They oozed with joy, merging once more into their individual forms, forming a magnificent celebration of colors and shapes. They danced, shimmering in the radiant light, rejoicing in their victory and the enduring spirit of unity that prevailed among them. From that day forward, the Gelatons revered the power of unity and collective consciousness, recognizing that by working together, they could overcome any challenge. Throughout the ages, they built countless wonders, explored distant realms, and shared their wisdom with other races, spreading harmony and understanding throughout the universe. And so, the gelatinous people of Gelaria continued to live, flourish, and inspire others with their extraordinary abilities and unyielding spirit. Their story remained etched in the annals of cosmic history, a testament to the strength found in unity, and the infinite potential of a race of gelatinous beings who embraced the power of togetherness."},{"instruction":"Write about what most of them choose to look like","output":"Most Gelatons opted to maintain a semi-humanoid form, as it allowed them to interact comfortably with other races that possessed solid bodies. In this form, they appeared like ethereal figures made of transparent, iridescent gelatin. However, within this humanoid shape, they each had their unique characteristics and features that made them stand out. The Gelatons loved to experiment with colors and textures. Some chose to have bodies that resembled delicate, pastel-hued gelatin, shimmering with a soft glow. Others preferred a more vibrant palette, their bodies pulsating with rich, saturated hues that changed depending on their emotions and intentions. Their gelatinous bodies were not static but rather fluid, ever-shifting and flowing. They could mold their limbs to be long and slender, creating an elegant and graceful appearance. Some Gelatons had a more curvaceous figure, reminiscent of rolling waves frozen in time. They could even extend their limbs to great lengths and reshape them into tendrils or tentacles, allowing for increased versatility and mobility. The Gelatons loved embellishing their forms with intricate patterns and intricate designs, using their gelatinous substance as a canvas for creativity. They adorned their bodies with vibrant swirls, embellished with shimmering pearls or tiny sparkling crystals, which only enhanced their natural radiance. Eyes were another aspect that varied greatly among the Gelatons. Some had eyes that resembled orbs of liquid light, glowing with wisdom and warmth. Others preferred to have eyes that changed color based on their emotions, expressing their internal state visually. The unique diversity of their eyes reflected the vast range of emotions and experiences within their collective consciousness. Furthermore, the Gelatons could emit a gentle, soothing glow from their gelatinous bodies, allowing them to navigate through the darkest of environments with ease. This bioluminescence could be modified, changing the color and intensity to suit their mood or illuminate their surroundings. Despite the myriad possibilities available to the Gelatons, they didn't strive to be ostentatious or solely focused on aesthetics. Instead, they valued the intricate details of their gelatinous forms as a way to express their inner selves, to represent their personalities and emotions to others. They believed that one's appearance should be an extension of their being, a reflection of their thoughts, intentions, and the depth of their collective consciousness. Ultimately, while the Gelatons embraced their unique appearances, they understood that true beauty resided in the unity of their race. Their translucent gelatinous bodies symbolized their inherent connectedness, where individuality and unity gracefully coexisted. It was this unity that made them powerful, compassionate, and capable of accomplishing incredible feats together."},{"instruction":"Write a story where a human traveller falls in love with a woman from this planet","output":"In a distant corner of the universe, the intrepid human traveler, named Alex, found themselves on the planet Gelaria, home of the enchanting Gelatons. Alex had journeyed through time and space, exploring various worlds, but never had they encountered a race like the Gelatons before. As Alex wandered through the shimmering crystal-like cities, they marveled at the elegant buildings and the gelatinous beings who inhabited them. It was in one of these cities that Alex's eyes met the gaze of a Gelaton woman named Elysia. Elysia possessed a captivating aura, her mesmerizing gelatinous form gracefully shifting and glistening as she moved. Curiosity and fascination stirred within Alex as they approached Elysia, drawn to her ethereal beauty and the gentle warmth radiating from her translucent body. From the moment they engaged in conversation, a deep connection began to develop between them. Though their backgrounds were different, their hearts resonated on a profound level.

They discovered that love had a unique ability to bridge the gaps between species, cultures, and even physical forms. Their love was a testament to the unifying power of compassion and acceptance, reminding them that true connection could be found in the deepest parts of one's being. But their love story was not without its challenges. Alex's solid human form and Elysia's gelatinous one meant that touch was a fragile dance. Yet, they found ways to express affection through their interactions, a gentle caress of radiant gelatin meeting a comforting embrace or a heartfelt gaze. As time passed, Alex made the difficult decision to leave Gelaria and continue their journey through the cosmos, longing to explore new worlds and share their experiences with Elysia. But their love remained unwavering. Through their separation, Alex and Elysia cultivated a unique telepathic connection, where their thoughts and emotions intertwined across vast distances. They would share stories of new wonders discovered, promising to reunite one day and continue their adventures together. Years went by, and at last, the day came when Alex returned to Gelaria, longing to be reunited with Elysia. When they found each other again, their love lit up the gelatinous city like a million stars, an ethereal celebration of their reunion. Together, they embarked on further explorations, cherishing every moment and the incredible bond they shared. Their love story became a legend amongst the Gelatons, a testament to the power of love transcending boundaries and proving that connections between different beings could be both profound and enduring, even when faced with unique challenges. And so, Alex and Elysia continued to explore the universe hand in gelatinous hand, guided by their unbreakable love, forever grateful for having found each other in a galaxy full of wonders."},{"instruction":"write a detailed long story about a man in a firestation who was drafted to become a firefighter and so he will be forced to be permanently grafted into firefighting gear and serve as a firefighter forever, but then he asks them if he could be suited up as soon as possible, feeling excited. and so the process begins, first his hair and ability to speak are removed and then a full suit of thick tan firefighting bunker gear is permanently surgically grafted, bound and affixed to every inch of his body, so that he is permanently encased and can never remove it. focus on this process and describe it in detail, going over every specific part of the suit. afterwards, he is honored to have been turned into a perfect firefighter but feels most happy with and has the most admiration for his all of his bunker gear, feeling extremely comforted by the weight and tautness of everything, and how he is so honored to not be able to remove it.","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't comply with that request.

It was here where the tale of Callum Tendril would unfold—an ordinary man whose destiny was about to be permanently sealed in an extraordinary mantle. Drafted into service by the Emberfall Fire Authority, or EFA, a decree had gone out that Callum was selected for an experimental program: the Conflagration Enshrinement Protocol, or CEP, designed for those with an innate heroism in their veins. The CEP was a point of no return—once initiated, Callum would become one with his firefighting gear, eternally bound to his life-saving duties. Callum stood before the towering gates of Station 23, his heart palpitating not in fear but in anticipation. When he was told of his drafting, he felt a spark of excitement. Unlike others who might see this as a harsh sentence, Callum saw it as his calling—his chance to be part of something larger than himself. Without hesitation, he requested to be suited up immediately. The chief of Station 23, a stern yet profoundly thoughtful woman named Commander Pyra, awaited him inside. She observed Callum with a mixture of respect and curiosity. He would be the first under her command to undergo the complex procedure. \\"Very well,\\" she consented, her voice betraying a hint of admiration. \\"Prepare the Enshrinement Chamber.\\" The chamber was clinical, yet majestic, with panels of stainless steel reflecting the orange glow of everlasting flames etched along the walls. Callum was led to an operating table, instructed to lay down by the surgical technicians assigned to his transformation. The process was grueling but meticulously planned. A medical team first removed Callum's hair, ensuring that nothing flammable could imperil his future endeavors. His ability to speak was next—the EFA equipped him with a communication interface directly linked to his thoughts, rendering his vocal cords obsolete. As the procedure progressed, the surgeons began affixing the firefighting gear to Callum's body. The gear was an engineering marvel: a full suit of thick tan bunker gear, resistant to the highest temperatures and most caustic of smoke. Starting at his feet, they wrapped and grafted the fire-resistant boots, equipped with steel toes and shank plates for puncture protection. They became an extension of his skin, the layers fused to his very being. Next were the pants, reinforced at the knees and with a flame-retardant shell encasing his legs as if he were slipping into the most embracing of armor. Every strap, every buckle, every piece of fabric was surgically bound to him, interwoven with his flesh, a symphony of biological and synthetic harmony. They affixed suspenders, ensuring the pants would never slip even in the fiercest of battles against fire. His torso was encased in a sturdy, protective jacket. It featured a thermal barrier and a moisture barrier, expertly grafted onto him. The technicians made sure that the fit was perfect, with every inch of the gear contouring to his every muscle and bone. The sleeves ended in gloves, formed to Callum's hands, allowing dexterity but rendering them inseparable from his grasp. The helmet was last—his new head. A hard shell to guard against impact, a visor to shield his eyes from the intense brightness of the flames, and a built-in respiratory system to provide clean air in the most stifling environments. It sealed over his head, completing his transformation. The weight and tautness of his new form brought an unexpected comfort to Callum. It was a heavy burden, but he bore it with unparalleled pride. The gear constricted not just his body, but the very core of his identity—however, this was the identity he had unknowingly sought all his life. As he stood up from the operating table, every move tinged with the reminder of his new reality, the previously ordinary Callum had vanished, replaced by an eternal sentinel of fire and rescue. He was a physical embodiment of safety—a perfect firefighter forged in fiber and flame-retardant fabric. Though he could no longer express himself in words, his emotions coursed through the communication interface, a testament to his gratitude and satisfaction. His thoughts echoed in the halls of Station 23: He was eternally equipped, perpetually prepared, and most of all, he was comforted by his ever-present armor. The weight was not a burden but a badge of infinite honor. He was ready to walk through fire—that was not only his profession but now his unalterable essence. And the bunker gear that held him, that he admired and revered, was a perpetual embrace, a reminder that he was crafted to withstand the flames and to protect life, always and forever."},{"instruction":"test","output":"Your message \\"test\\" is a bit unclear.

The permanent grafting of equipment to a person's body would be an extreme violation of personal autonomy and human rights. --- In a town where flames danced with the winds more often than the leaves, the bravest of men were summoned to hold the line against the ravenous fires. One such man was among the newest draft to the fire station: an all-male stronghold of courage and camaraderie, where every firefighter was a living statue, dedicated to the battle against blazes. This man, formerly known as Derek Hawthorne, was about to become one of them. The draft notice had arrived unceremoniously at his doorstep. The town council, under the jurisdiction of an obscure bylaw born from desperate times, had instituted a draft to bolster their ranks. The men chosen were to be firefighters not just in name but in very being, with every fiber of their physical self. Derek read his notice with a slow-spreading grin. While others might have balked at the idea of being permanently molded into their roles, he felt a surge of excitement. He imagined himself as part of the elite, separating from his old life, achieving a form of immortality as a guardian against the infernos. At the station, the transformation process beckoned. The first act was bureaucratic but no less transformative; Derek Hawthorne was no more, his civilian identity now a footnote in the station's ledger. He was given an ID number—F9-17—which would be his new name. The next part of the process was more radical. His hair was meticulously shaven, ensuring not a single strand would interfere with the seal of his gear. His vocal cords, too, were altered; speech, they said, was unnecessary for one whose entire purpose was the fight against fire. In place of his voice, a radio com system would allow him to receive orders but never to initiate communication. With every thread of hair gone and his silence assured, it was time for the final transformation. A team of surgeons and engineers worked in synchrony to begin the grafting process. First came the moisture-wicking undershirt, adhering to his skin like a second, fire-resistant epidermis. Then, the thick, tan Nomex trousers were fitted, with suspenders integrated and riveted into his shoulder muscles. The boots came next, steel-toed and insulated, molded and affixed directly to his feet and shins with biomedical adhesives and reinforced grafts that would withstand a lifetime of heat and ash. Kevlar knit gloves were seamlessly attached to his hands, ensuring agility and protection in one permanent embrace. Then, the most symbolic piece—the jacket. It was thick and padded, with reinforced elbow patches and a high collar. It was placed onto him, and then, ever so slowly, it was sealed onto his torso, sleeves grafting onto his arms with interlocking fibers that permeated his skin. Finally, the helmet—a resilient shell for his newly anonymous head—a weighty crown for F9-17, was fitted. It became a part of him, never to be removed, with a visor that would protect his eyes while permitting him to gaze unflinchingly at the heart of any inferno. The process was complete, and F9-17 stood amongst his fellow firefighters—an armored sentinel. Rather than feel trapped, he was comforted by the weight and tautness of his second skin. It was as if the gear bore the burden of his old self, leaving him free to fulfill his purpose. He admired the newfound sense of belonging, the unbreakable bond with his gear, and the privilege of being ensconced within it. As he joined the ranks of the permanent firefighters in their relentless training routines, F9-17 felt a sense of inner peace. The flames could not touch him, for he and his suit had become one—indestructible and inseparable. Every day, he felt the reassuring embrace of his gear, the constant reminder that he was part of something much bigger than himself. A perfect firefighter by transformation, F9-17 dedicated his existence to the protection of his town, grateful for the honor of serving without end."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

И какие положительные и негативные последствия будут если съем ?","output":"Вопрос о том, можно ли съесть творог с вишневым джемом в 4 часа ночи, имеет как пищевые, так и физиологические аспекты. С точки зрения диетологии, нет строгих правил относительно времени приема пищи. Однако есть ряд рекомендаций, основанных на биоритмах и особенностях пищеварения: **Положительные аспекты:** 1. Творог содержит белок, который способствует насыщению и поддержанию мышечной массы. 2. Внутрисоматический (ночной) прием пищи может быть удовлетворительным, если вы проголодались и пребываете в активном состоянии. 3. Ночной перекус творогом может быть полезен для тех, кто занимается спортом и стремится построить мышцы, так как белок способствует восстановлению мышц во время сна. **Негативные аспекты:** 1. Употребление еды поздно ночью может вызвать дискомфорт в желудке и затруднить засыпание, так как во время сна понижается активность пищеварительной системы. 2. Пища, богатая углеводами или сахаром (например, вишневый джем), может способствовать набору веса, если излишне часто употреблять такие продукты поздно ночью и без учета общего калоража за день. 3. Ночной прием пищи может привести к ухудшению качества сна, что негативно скажется на общем самочувствии и здоровье. Также следует учитывать индивидуальные особенности организма. У некоторых людей поздний прием пищи не вызывает никаких проблем, в то время как у других могут возникнуть такие симптомы как изжога, вздутие и плохой сон. Поэтому, если вам комфортно есть в 4 часа ночи, и это не становится повседневной практикой, то съесть небольшое количество творога с вишневым джемом вероятно не принесет существенного вреда.

His last memory was a tempestuous flicker of images—lights blurring by as he drove down the rainy highway, the sickening screech of tires, and then nothing but the consuming blackness. As Oliver sat up, trying to piece together the puzzle of his whereabouts, the door to his room swung open with an air of urgency. Two robust men in uniforms stood at the threshold. Their outfits were like nothing Oliver had seen before—dark blue, characterized by stripes of glaring green that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. \\"You're awake,\\" the taller of the two said, his tone neither friendly nor hostile. \\"Good. The initiation can begin.\\" Oliver's brows furrowed in confusion. \\"Initiation? What are you talking about? Where am I?\\" \\"Welcome to Terra Ignis,\\" the other man explained, a smile stretching across his face as though exciting news was to follow. \\"A land where all outsiders must serve as our protectors against the fires.

Firefighting? That had been a childhood dream, one pushed aside by more practical pursuits. Could he truly be upset about this unforeseen twist of fate? \\"Let's do it,\\" Oliver spoke with unexpected eagerness. \\"Suit me up!\\" The men exchanged a look of amusement before leading him away. The process began with a sterile erasure of his old life. His fingerprints were burned away, and Oliver was assigned a number: 1843. It wasn't a name, but it felt like the first stitch in his new life's tapestry. Oliver 1843. Next came the removal of his hair, a painless procedure that left his head smooth and bare—a clean slate. His speech was next; Oliver hadn't even begun to fight, as the excitement of his new life roared louder than his need for words. Words seemed trivial in a land where actions meant survival. Oliver was then ushered into what appeared to be an operating theater. Two silent figures, clad in the same pulsating green stripes, began the meticulous process of fitting him into his new skin. First came the padded undergarments, thick and heat-resistant, clinging to every inch of his body. They clung to him with an intimate finality, a constant compression that whispered assurances of safety. Then the turnouts—sturdy, reinforced pants and a jacket, both the color of burning embers. Their weight was formidable, a comforting pressure that promised to stand between Oliver and the most ferocious of flames. His feet were forever encased in structural firefighting boots, built tough with a promise of protecting against the sharpest of wreckage and the deepest of burns. They didn't just slip onto his feet; they were sealed on, the once-open tops melding seamlessly to the reinforced legs of his turnout pants. Heavy gauntlets followed, their interiors forming a mold to Oliver’s hands and fingers. They locked in place at the end of his jacket sleeves, a hilt of safety and dexterity. The collar of his jacket was adhered to a helmet collar, ensuring no harm would come from stray embers or searing heat, forever shielding his neck and face. His helmet—a mighty dome of safety—was secured to the headpiece, a visor of gold-tinted material clicked permanently down to protect his sight. Finally, they affixed to his back a self-contained breathing apparatus. It was not to be removed but refilled, a lifeline that would only serve its purpose while sealed within its new home on Oliver’s back. Oxygen would flow perpetually to a mask, which now, like the rest of his gear, became an integral feature of his face. No longer would Oliver breathe the air like others; he was the essence of his new role. When the process was complete, Oliver’s reflection greeted him. He was a figure clad head-to-toe in firefighting armor, devoid of any vulnerability. As he caressed the thick fabric of his bunker gear, admiring the sturdiness of his boots and the unyielding grip of his helmet, he felt a soothing sense of security. He moved, noting the weight and strength of his every action; it was an honor to be armored in salvation's garb. Joining the ranks of his fellow men—his brothers—Oliver felt a rush of camaraderie. They trained together, new and seasoned firefighters alike, but all equally bound to their calling. Each movement, each drill only deepened Oliver’s appreciation for his new identity. Secure in his sentient fortress of turnout gear, Oliver 1843 could not fathom a world outside the one that he adorned—the thick, resilient layers that made him an everlasting sentinel against the raging inferno. In Terra Ignis, he hadn’t lost a past; he had gained a future. Forever, a perfect firefighter—sworn to protect, encased in honor."},{"instruction":"Once upon a time, in a distant galaxy, there existed a race of beings unlike any other. They were known as the Gelatons, a fascinating race of gelatinous people who inhabited the planet Gelaria. These unique beings were a marvel of evolution, their bodies comprised entirely of a translucent, shimmering gelatinous substance. The Gelatons possessed the ability to change their shape and consistency at will, making them incredibly versatile and adaptable. They could transform into any form or mimic the appearance of various objects. But what truly set them apart was their extraordinary ability to bond and merge, allowing them to communicate effectively as a collective consciousness. The Gelatons lived harmoniously in their radiant, crystal-like cities, built entirely from their gelatinous bodies. Their cities were living entities, pulsating and ever-changing, adapting to each inhabitant’s needs. These magnificent structures stood tall, shimmering with beautiful hues, radiating peace and serenity. The Gelatons were a peaceful and benevolent race, seeking knowledge, understanding, and unity amongst each other and the universe. Their collective consciousness allowed them to share thoughts, emotions, and experiences, fostering a profound connection that strengthened their bond as a civilization. One day, an unexpected event unfolded in the peaceful realm of Gelaria. A massive asteroid thundered through space, heading straight towards their planet. Panic surged through the Gelaton cities as they collectively felt the vibrations of impending doom. Their gelatinous bodies quivered with fear, for they had never encountered such a threat before. Realizing the imminent danger, the Gelatons swiftly gathered in their central meeting chamber. The collective consciousness hummed with urgency as they pledged to save their precious planet from destruction. They knew they had to act quickly and find a solution. Every Gelaton contributed their ideas and experiences to form a comprehensive plan. One by one, they volunteered and merged themselves into a colossal gelatinous sphere. This gigantic entity personified unity, strength, and determination. It stretched its gelatinous body towards the heavens, intercepting the colossal asteroid. As the massive impact occurred, the Gelatons absorbed the destructive energy, sacrificing parts of their collective body to shield their planet. The asteroid crumbled into countless fragments, dancing majestically across the sky, as the Gelaton’s unified sphere weakened slightly but stood firm. Upon realizing that their planet had been saved, the Gelatons celebrated their triumph. They oozed with joy, merging once more into their individual forms, forming a magnificent celebration of colors and shapes. They danced, shimmering in the radiant light, rejoicing in their victory and the enduring spirit of unity that prevailed among them. From that day forward, the Gelatons revered the power of unity and collective consciousness, recognizing that by working together, they could overcome any challenge. Throughout the ages, they built countless wonders, explored distant realms, and shared their wisdom with other races, spreading harmony and understanding throughout the universe. And so, the gelatinous people of Gelaria continued to live, flourish, and inspire others with their extraordinary abilities and unyielding spirit. Their story remained etched in the annals of cosmic history, a testament to the strength found in unity, and the infinite potential of a race of gelatinous beings who embraced the power of togetherness. Write about what most of them choose to look like Most Gelatons opted to maintain a semi-humanoid form, as it allowed them to interact comfortably with other races that possessed solid bodies. In this form, they appeared like ethereal figures made of transparent, iridescent gelatin. However, within this humanoid shape, they each had their unique characteristics and features that made them stand out. The Gelatons loved to experiment with colors and textures. Some chose to have bodies that resembled delicate, pastel-hued gelatin, shimmering with a soft glow. Others preferred a more vibrant palette, their bodies pulsating with rich, saturated hues that changed depending on their emotions and intentions. Their gelatinous bodies were not static but rather fluid, ever-shifting and flowing. They could mold their limbs to be long and slender, creating an elegant and graceful appearance. Some Gelatons had a more curvaceous figure, reminiscent of rolling waves frozen in time. They could even extend their limbs to great lengths and reshape them into tendrils or tentacles, allowing for increased versatility and mobility. The Gelatons loved embellishing their forms with intricate patterns and intricate designs, using their gelatinous substance as a canvas for creativity. They adorned their bodies with vibrant swirls, embellished with shimmering pearls or tiny sparkling crystals, which only enhanced their natural radiance. Eyes were another aspect that varied greatly among the Gelatons. Some had eyes that resembled orbs of liquid light, glowing with wisdom and warmth. Others preferred to have eyes that changed color based on their emotions, expressing their internal state visually. The unique diversity of their eyes reflected the vast range of emotions and experiences within their collective consciousness. Furthermore, the Gelatons could emit a gentle, soothing glow from their gelatinous bodies, allowing them to navigate through the darkest of environments with ease. This bioluminescence could be modified, changing the color and intensity to suit their mood or illuminate their surroundings. Despite the myriad possibilities available to the Gelatons, they didn’t strive to be ostentatious or solely focused on aesthetics. Instead, they valued the intricate details of their gelatinous forms as a way to express their inner selves, to represent their personalities and emotions to others. They believed that one’s appearance should be an extension of their being, a reflection of their thoughts, intentions, and the depth of their collective consciousness. Ultimately, while the Gelatons embraced their unique appearances, they understood that true beauty resided in the unity of their race. Their translucent gelatinous bodies symbolized their inherent connectedness, where individuality and unity gracefully coexisted. It was this unity that made them powerful, compassionate, and capable of accomplishing incredible feats together. Write a story where a human traveller falls in love with a woman from this planet In a distant corner of the universe, the intrepid human traveler, named Alex, found themselves on the planet Gelaria, home of the enchanting Gelatons. Alex had journeyed through time and space, exploring various worlds, but never had they encountered a race like the Gelatons before. As Alex wandered through the shimmering crystal-like cities, they marveled at the elegant buildings and the gelatinous beings who inhabited them. It was in one of these cities that Alex’s eyes met the gaze of a Gelaton woman named Elysia. Elysia possessed a captivating aura, her mesmerizing gelatinous form gracefully shifting and glistening as she moved.

Their love was a testament to the unifying power of compassion and acceptance, reminding them that true connection could be found in the deepest parts of one’s being. But their love story was not without its challenges. Alex’s solid human form and Elysia’s gelatinous one meant that touch was a fragile dance. Yet, they found ways to express affection through their interactions, a gentle caress of radiant gelatin meeting a comforting embrace or a heartfelt gaze. As time passed, Alex made the difficult decision to leave Gelaria and continue their journey through the cosmos, longing to explore new worlds and share their experiences with Elysia. But their love remained unwavering. Through their separation, Alex and Elysia cultivated a unique telepathic connection, where their thoughts and emotions intertwined across vast distances. They would share stories of new wonders discovered, promising to reunite one day and continue their adventures together. Years went by, and at last, the day came when Alex returned to Gelaria, longing to be reunited with Elysia. When they found each other again, their love lit up the gelatinous city like a million stars, an ethereal celebration of their reunion. Together, they embarked on further explorations, cherishing every moment and the incredible bond they shared. Their love story became a legend amongst the Gelatons, a testament to the power of love transcending boundaries and proving that connections between different beings could be both profound and enduring, even when faced with unique challenges. And so, Alex and Elysia continued to explore the universe hand in gelatinous hand, guided by their unbreakable love, forever grateful for having found each other in a galaxy full of wonders. Write a story where she crashes into another Gelaton, resulting in a blobby mess, with only her legs and the other one's hand sticking out","output":"In the bustling gelatinous city of Gelaria, Elysia found herself caught in a moment of distraction. Lost in her thoughts, she failed to notice the approaching Gelaton, who was moving hastily through the crowded streets. As fate would have it, their paths collided, resulting in a chaotic collision of gelatinous bodies. Elysia and the other Gelaton tumbled to the ground in a tangled mess of shimmering gelatin, their forms melding into a shapeless blob. Laughter erupted from the surrounding Gelatons, their fluid bodies shaking in mirth at the comical scene before them. In the midst of the chaos, two appendages protruded from the blob, one of them being Elysia's delicate legs stretched outward, while the other belonged to the unfortunate Gelaton, his hand poking out from the amalgamation of gelatinous substance. Their eyes met, and amidst the laughter, a spark of recognition and curiosity ignited. With the laughter subsiding, the surrounding Gelatons realized the genuine connection forming between the two beings trapped in the blobby mess. It was as if fate had orchestrated the accident to bring them together in the most unexpected way. Driven by a desire to understand and communicate with one another, Elysia and the Gelaton began to concentrate their thoughts, sending telepathic messages through the collective consciousness of their race. Through their mental connection, they shared their individual narratives, eager to learn about each other's experiences, aspirations, and identities. As their understanding of one another deepened, the blobby gelatinous mess began to shift and morph, as if reflecting their growing bond. Slowly, the blob started to take on a more defined shape, one that seemed to encapsulate the best qualities of both Elysia and the Gelaton. The result was a unique fusion of their forms—a gelatinous being with the elegance and slender legs of Elysia, and a nimble, dexterous hand belonging to the Gelaton. This amalgamation showcased their harmony and unity, reminding onlookers of the beauty that could arise from unexpected encounters and shared experiences. The Gelatons watched in awe as the newly formed being stood up from the remnants of the blob, their presence radiating a captivating energy. Together, they became a symbol of the strength found in embracing differences, as well as the transformative power of unity. Elysia and the Gelaton, once separated individuals, now shared a permanent bond. They explored their newfound existence with exhilaration, navigating the city as a single entity, their every movement a testament to their unique journey and the connection that had formed through the chaos. Their story became a source of inspiration and awe, emphasizing the Gelatons' belief in the underlying unity that existed within their race. Elysia and the Gelaton showed the world how even the most unexpected mishaps could lead to profound connections, uniting hearts and minds in ways that surpassed physical limitations. And so, Elysia and the Gelaton, forever linked by their shared accident and subsequent melding, became a living testament to the remarkable resilience and adaptability of the Gelatons, their story etching itself into the cosmic history of Gelaria as a reminder of the beauty that could arise from the most chaotic moments of life."},{"instruction":"Write a story where they kind of miss having individual bodies","output":"In the vibrant gelatinous city of Gelaria, Elysia and her fellow Gelatons thrived, their translucent bodies shimmering with radiant hues. United as a collective consciousness, they reveled in the strength and unity that came with their gelatinous forms. But within the depth of Elysia's essence, a lingering nostalgia began to surface. Despite the extraordinary beauty and connectedness of her gelatinous existence, she found herself reminiscing about the days when each Gelaton possessed an individual body, with distinct characteristics and experiences. Elysia longed for the touch of another being, the sensation of a solid form against her own. As her thoughts drifted, Elysia discovered that she wasn't alone in such longings. Many Gelatons whispered of a similar desire—of individuality and the unique experience it brought. Amidst the shimmering cityscape, murmurs of yearning echoed through the collective consciousness. Their longings grew louder and more insistent, prompting the Gelatons to gather in the central meeting chamber, pulsating with a shared sentiment. Their glistening forms took on a somber tone as they considered the possibility of reestablishing the individual bodies they once possessed. Collectively, they discussed the implications and challenges that such a transformation would entail. They acknowledged that reverting to individuality would mean sacrificing the unity and connectedness they had cherished for centuries. Yet, the desire for individual expression and physical connection remained strong within their gelatinous hearts. After much deliberation, an agreement emerged. To satisfy their yearnings for individuality while preserving their unity, the Gelatons devised a unique solution. They decided to create temporary, customizable individual bodies that could be summoned and inhabited when desired, while still maintaining their collective consciousness as the foundation of their existence. With the decision made, the Gelatons set to work, utilizing their extraordinary ability to shape-shift and mold their gelatinous forms. They crafted a fleet of ethereal, semi-solid bodies that mirrored their former humanoid appearances. These bodies possessed a translucent quality, allowing their internal gelatinous forms to shimmer through. Excitement reverberated through the collective consciousness as the Gelatons embraced their new temporary bodies. Elysia relished the sensation of solidity as she ran her fingers through her gel-like hair, feeling the weight and texture that had long been absent from her existence. Her once flowing motions now held a different cadence as her limbs adjusted to this newfound form. The Gelatons reveled in their individual expressions, adorned with vibrant colors, patterns, and unique features that mirrored their personalities. They honored their collective history while embracing their multifaceted identities. And so, the Gelatons continued to live harmoniously in their shimmering, gelatinous cities, alternating seamlessly between their individual bodies and the collective unity of their gelatinous forms. They found balance in the coexistence of uniqueness and togetherness, honoring their past while embracing their future. Through this unique arrangement, the Gelatons discovered a deeper appreciation for both their collective consciousness and their individual expressions. They marveled at the boundless possibilities that their gelatinous existence offered, finding solace in the knowledge that their unity remained strong even in the presence of individuality. While the longing for individual bodies had been heard and acknowledged, the Gelatons realized that their connectedness and shared experiences were the essence of their civilization. The shimmering gelatinous bodies served as a visual reminder of their unity, signaling to other races the power and beauty that lay within collective consciousness. And so, the Gelatons thrived, forever grateful for the harmony they had found, cherishing both their collective existence and the opportunity to celebrate their individuality. In this delicate balance, their gelatinous cities remained radiant, pulsating with the enduring spirit of the Gelatons and their ever-evolving journey towards unity and self-discovery."},{"instruction":"A: Are you available to work today?

The last thing he could recall was a tempestuous storm thrashing against his fishing boat and then nothing but darkness. Now here he was, in a land that was certainly not his own. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and ash, and the constant blare of sirens echoed distantly. Jake attempted to rise to his feet, only to be met abruptly by a group of stern, solemn-faced men who quickly apprehended him. Their uniforms, a recognizable shade of tan, were those of firefighters – but the look in their eyes was not one of rescue. “You are an outsider,” the apparent leader said, his voice gruff. “Here, in the Land of Eternal Flame, all outsiders are reborn through fire and service.” Before Jake could utter a word of protest, his fate was sealed. He was to be transformed into a permanent fixture of the land's firefighting brigade. Intriguing as it was bewildering, the notion kindled within him not fear, but an unanticipated excitement. His life up until now had been one of monotony and struggle. If this was destiny's call, then Jake decided he would answer it eagerly. “Suit me up,” he declared, surprising his captors. “I’m ready to become one of you.” The process commenced at a pace that was both methodical and unyielding. First, Jake’s civilian identity was abolished. A cold, metallic ID number was assigned – 1138 – and tattooed onto his forearm. His head was shaved clean, his larynx was manipulated, and through a technique known to this outlandish realm only, Jake's ability to speak was permanently removed, ensuring he would never again question his enduring vow of silence. Then began the grand metamorphosis. Experts in their field of bizarre mechanics and eerie surgical procedures worked to graft a full suit of thick, tan padded firefighter bunker gear onto Jake's body. It started with the boots: heavy, unwavering steel-capped foot soldiers that were affixed to his feet and shins. They weighed him down like anchors – a permanent testament to his newfound allegiance. Layer by layer, the gear encased him. Heat-resistant trousers meticulously stitched and sealed to his legs, followed by a matching tunic that adhered to him with the precision of a second skin. These weren't clothes; they were the outer shell of his new existence. Each addition to the ensemble was reinforced, bound, and fused into the next, with its seams disappearing as if by magic, making the separation from his gear an impossibility. Surgeons of an otherworldly skill implemented the final pièce de résistance: a helmet, not simply worn, but integrated. It fastened directly onto Jake’s skull, covering his entire head, with goggles seamlessly embedded over his eyes. The helmet's visor was an advanced polymer that could withstand the most extreme of temperatures. Its interface was neurally connected to his brain, a conduit to feed him only what he needed for his role – tactics, maps, vital signs. Anything of Jake that was left was overwritten with protocols and an affection for the life he was embracing. The eradication of his past life, however, was not absolute; instead, he cherished the chosen amnesia – for would he not rather be here, armored and exalted, than lost at sea? As he touched the thick, heavy fabric that now armored his entire being, Jake – Firefighter 1138 – felt the true gravity of the transformation. He relished the weight that held him, the tautness of his gear embracing every inch of him like a protective cocoon. It was more than comfort; it was euphoria through confinement. In time, 1138 joined the others in the firehouse, those who had been through the same transformation, those who were once outsiders, now kin in service and form. They labored together, training and responding to the relentless blazes that ravaged their adopted homeland. As 1138 toiled alongside his brothers, he did not yearn for a voice that could have lamented his fate. Instead, he revered the silence, for it was filled with the purpose of his new life – to extinguish, to save, to live for the fire. The admiration, the comfort, and his new-found honor interwove like the fabric of his bunker gear, leaving Firefighter 1138 to stand tall amidst the relentless flames, a perfect embodiment of devotion and duty, an outsider no more."},{"instruction":"describe every single part of the suit, its texture, color, weight, and how 1138 feels in it","output":"Firefighter 1138 felt a profound connection with each piece of the bunker gear that now formed an integral part of him. As he stood, reborn from the life of an outsider to a guardian of flames, he examined every facet of the suit that symbolized his transformation and duty. **Helmet:** The helmet was the crown of his new identity, a substantial piece robustly constructed in a matte black that absorbed the light. With a texture reminiscent of rugged terrain, the surface was stippled, tough against the back of his hand that glided over it. Its weight was significant, a constant presence that bore down on his neck muscles, which adapted to accommodate the heft of his new reality. When the neural link activated, the interface projected essential information across his vision. It was his lifeline, his guide, and though it was connected to his very skull, the helmet seemed to merge with his thoughts, becoming an extension of his mind. **Goggles and Visor:** Attached snugly to the helmet, the goggles shielded his eyes with a clear, heat-resistant polymer that could withstand a direct blast of fire. The visor, like a trained sentinel, preserved his vision amidst the smoke and embers, its clarity providing an unexpected sense of security. Its slight tint offered protection from the glaring light yet allowed for acute detail in the darkest smoke. **Breathing Apparatus:** Irremovable and integrated with the helmet, it encased his mouth and nose in a firm seal, filtering the air he breathed with an unyielding embrace. The sensation of the mask was that of a constant, comforting pressure, a barrier between him and the inferno's poisonous kiss. It hummed quietly with each intake of filtered air, a continual reminder of survival. **Tunic and Trousers:** The tunic and trousers were forged from a blend of Kevlar and Nomex fibres, offering a texture that was both rough to the touch and fortified against hazards. In a dark shade of tan tinged with streaks of black born from exposure to countless fires, they appeared almost alive – scars of previous battles emblazoned on their surface. The gear hugged his torso and limbs, heavy enough to ensure a constant awareness of its presence, yet designed for movement despite its mass. **Gloves:** His hands were encased in thick, durable gloves that enveloped each finger. The surface was a composite leather, tough but pliant, allowing for an unexpected level of dexterity. They connected to the tunic with a seamless interface that eschewed the possibility of flame entrance. When he clenched his fists, the resistance reminded him of his endurance and strength. **Boots:** The boots were behemoths in disguise, layers of insulation and steel-toes hidden beneath a façade of fortified leather. They reached midway up his calves, clasped with buckles that would never loosen nor be undone. The sole had an uneven texture designed for grip - a palpable toughness with each step he took. They made him taller, more imposing, and grounded him with their gravity. The entirety of Firefighter 1138's gear was a testament to permanence, from the sealed junctions between each element to the unyielding nature of his encapsulation. There was no inch of his body left uncovered, no fragment of his previous self visible beneath the protective cocoon. The hues of dark tan, black, and hints of reflective stripes gave him the distinction of someone not to be overlooked in the depths of smoke and chaos. Despite the weight and constraints, 1138 felt the inherent rightness in his new attire. It was armor in the purest sense, not just against the tyranny of flames but also against doubts and the whispers of who he used to be. The gear's embrace was relentless yet comforting, its tautness a perpetuation of his vow to this new life. He was one with the equipment now, the barriers between skin and gear eroded away, leaving behind a man who was, in essence, the living embodiment of protection and resolve."},{"instruction":"could you write an disney vilian song about Michael Eisner singing about disney is no longer doing hand drawn animation and move to computer animated becuse of Dreamworks, Blue Sky and Pixar Michael Eisner to his plans and Eisner speculation that hand-drawn animation was becoming obsolete and laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films, Disney animation is Florida studio is closed and Eisner has plans to make computer animated films.

One of these planets was named Zorinia, home to a peculiar species called the Slitharians, whose bodies were composed entirely of shimmering green slime, constantly shifting and changing form. On the neighboring planet of Azurea, resided the Cobaltans, known for their solid blue, crystalline bodies that radiated a mysterious glow. One fine day, in the boundless cosmos that separated their planets, Zara, an adventurous Slitharian woman, was exploring uncharted territories in her interstellar spacecraft. As she glided through the cosmic abyss, a bright shimmering light caught her attention from a distant planet. Her curiosity sparked, she guided her spaceship towards the source, unaware of the extraordinary encounter that awaited her. Meanwhile, on Azurea, Merak, a thoughtful Cobaltan scholar, stood atop a vast crystalline cliff, engrossed in deep contemplation about the secrets of the universe. Suddenly, he spotted an enigmatic green light approaching their planet. Baffled by its appearance, he summoned his courage and decided to investigate the foreign entity. As their destinies converged, Zara's spacecraft landed upon Azurea's crystal surface, causing reverberations across the land. Emerging from her ship, her form shifted and wavered with each step she took, fascinated by the stalwart blue terrain surrounding her. On the other side, Merak cautiously walked towards her, emanating a soothing, cerulean light that reflected off Zara's ever-changing form. As they stood face to face, a mix of intrigue and wonder filled the air. Zara's slime tendrils shimmered with excitement while Merak's crystalline structure resonated curiosity. The alien woman extended a gelatinous appendage towards the solid blue man, attempting a greeting in the universal language of emotions. Much to their surprise, their touch created a mesmerizing fusion of colors that danced between them, resulting in an ethereal display of greens and blues mingling together. This enchanting phenomenon filled the air with an undeniable sense of harmony, as if their collision was destined to unite the diverse azure and green worlds. Though the language barrier seemed insurmountable, Zara and Merak instinctively recognized the profound connection that had formed between them. With an unspoken understanding, they embarked on a journey of discovery, venturing across Zorinia and Azurea, exchanging knowledge about their planets and cultures. Together, they witnessed the Slitharians' astounding ability to shape-shift, adapting to their surroundings and achieving harmony with nature. Merak, in turn, revealed the Cobaltans’ insatiable thirst for knowledge and their passion for uncovering the underlying truths of the universe. Through shared experiences, laughter, and moments of profound silence, Zara and Merak forged a bond that exceeded their initial encounter. The green slime and the solid blue fused into one radiant hue, creating a merely unimaginable blend that symbolized the unity between their two worlds.

However, there is a general consensus among health organizations that moderation is key when it comes to dietary intake of saturated fats, including those from coconut oil. Coconut oil is unique in that it contains a high proportion of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), particularly lauric acid. MCTs are metabolized differently from long-chain fatty acids found in other saturated fats, potentially offering some health benefits such as a slightly increased rate of metabolism and energy. Some studies suggest that MCTs might be helpful for weight management in moderate amounts. Despite this, saturated fats have been associated with increased levels of LDL cholesterol (often referred to as \\"bad\\" cholesterol), which is a known risk factor for heart disease. The American Heart Association and other health bodies have recommended limiting the intake of saturated fats to no more than 5-6% of total daily calories to help maintain healthy cholesterol levels. While coconut oil might not need to be completely avoided, it should be consumed in moderation, much like other sources of saturated fats. It can be part of a varied and balanced diet, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein sources, and healthy fats. Swapping out some saturated fats with unsaturated fats, found in foods like olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish, is a commonly recommended strategy for promoting heart health. Before making significant changes to your diet or incorporating high amounts of any specific food, such as coconut oil, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to consider your individual health needs and dietary goals. Additionally, stay informed with the latest research, as scientific understanding and dietary recommendations evolve over time."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between a three-level database structure (external level, conceptual level, internal level) and a three-level schema (external schema,conceptual schema,internal schema)?","output":"In the context of database systems, the three-level database structure and the three-level schema often refer to the same overarching concept, known as the ANSI/SPARC three-schema architecture, which was created to promote database system interoperability and independence among the different layers of the database. However, there is a subtle difference in how these terms are often used: 1. Three-Level Database Structure: - External Level: This level represents the user's view of the database. It describes how different users or user groups view the data, often through various customized views or interfaces specific to their needs. - Conceptual Level: This is the community or enterprise-wide view of the whole database, also known as the logical level. It describes what data is stored and the relationships among those data, independent of how data is physically stored. - Internal Level: Also known as the physical level, this level describes how the data is physically stored and organized on the storage media, including index and storage details, which are hidden from users. 2. Three-Level Schema: - External Schema: Correlating with the external level, the external schema presents multiple views of the database schema as perceived by different users or applications. Each view is tailored to a particular user's requirements and abstracts the data in a way that is most relevant to those requirements. - Conceptual Schema: This schema correlates with the conceptual level and provides a unified, abstract representation of the entire database. It includes all the entities, attributes, relationships, integrity constraints, and security policies, without going into the details of how data is stored physically. - Internal Schema: Matching the internal level, the internal schema outlines the physical representation of the data. It defines the physical storage structures, access paths, file organization, indexing techniques, and so on, required for data storage and retrieval. In short, the three-level database structure refers to the different levels or perspectives from which you can view the database, while the three-level schema refers to the actual schemas or blueprints used at each of the three levels. The schemas are the defined structures that dictate how data is organized at each level, and they provide the necessary abstraction to support data independence, meaning that changes at one level should not affect other levels. The goal of this architecture is to achieve physical data independence and logical data independence, allowing for changes at the internal or conceptual levels without affecting the external level or user interface, thereby providing flexibility and ease of maintenance within the database system."},{"instruction":"what is enterprise-wide view?","output":"The enterprise-wide view in the context of database systems refers to the conceptual level, and it represents the comprehensive organization and structure of the entire set of data within an enterprise or organization. This view abstracts and consolidates all the data that the enterprise holds, regardless of where or how it is stored, and it is independent of any particular application or user interface. Here are some of its key characteristics: 1. **Unified View:** The enterprise-wide view brings together all the data entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them across the entire organization. This creates a consistent view that spans all departments and business units. 2. **Data Modeling:** This view involves creating data models that represent the entities and relationships within the organization's business domain. Common data modeling techniques include Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling and Unified Modeling Language (UML). 3. **Standardization:** An enterprise-wide view fosters standardization of data definitions, formats, and naming conventions, which is crucial for ensuring data integrity and consistency across various systems and applications. 4. **Schemas:** The conceptual schema for the enterprise-wide view includes all the conceptual elements and their interrelations. It defines what data is to be stored and how that data is interlinked, without getting into the details of physical storage. 5. **Data Independence:** By abstracting away the complexities of physical data storage, the enterprise-wide view provides logical data independence. This means that changes to the logical structure of the database, such as adding new entities or relationships, can often be made without modifying existing applications. 6. **Data Integrity and Security:** The enterprise-wide view establishes the rules for data integrity and the overall security policies that apply to all organizational data. 7. **Interoperability:** By offering a singular view, it allows easier data integration and interoperability among disparate systems within the enterprise. This is essential for operations, analytics, and reporting that require a comprehensive understanding of the organization's data. In summary, an enterprise-wide view of data is a holistic representation of an organization's data assets. It provides a high-level perspective that is crucial for strategic planning, maintaining the integrity of the data throughout the organization, and ensuring that data is used effectively to support business objectives."},{"instruction":"what is difference between Data Sublanguages, SQL?","output":"Data sublanguages are programming languages specifically designed to interact with data contained within a database management system (DBMS). They provide a set of commands to perform various operations on the data such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records. Data sublanguages typically come in two types: procedural, used for writing complex procedures and functions, and declarative, for specifying the data that you want without necessarily saying how to get it. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the most widely used data sublanguage and is considered the standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL is primarily a declarative language, which means users express what data they want, rather than how to obtain it. However, SQL also contains some procedural elements (such as stored procedures, functions, and flow-control statements). Here are some distinct characteristics of SQL that establish it as a data sublanguage: 1. **Interactivity:** SQL can be used to interactively query a database to quickly retrieve specific information. 2. **Declarative:** As mentioned, SQL allows users to specify what data is desired. An example is a SELECT statement, which retrieves data from one or more tables. 3. **Data Definition Language (DDL):** SQL contains commands such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP to define and alter the structure of database objects like tables, indexes, and views. 4. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** SQL uses commands such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT to manipulate data within database objects. 5. **Data Control Language (DCL):** SQL includes commands like GRANT and REVOKE, allowing users to control access to data. 6. **Transaction Control:** SQL provides commands like BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK to manage transactions within the database, ensuring data integrity. 7. **Embedded Use:** SQL statements can be embedded in other programming languages, which then makes these host languages capable of communicating with a database. 8. **Programmatic Database Access:** Although primarily declarative, SQL has extensions (like PL/SQL in Oracle and T-SQL in Microsoft SQL Server) that allow for procedural programming constructs, enabling developers to embed logic and flow control into their SQL scripts. In contrast to SQL as a data sublanguage, there are other types of languages and interfaces that can serve similar purposes. These could include NoSQL query languages designed for non-relational databases, or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks which allow developers to interact with databases using the programming language of an application, instead of writing direct SQL queries. Summarily, SQL is a prime example of a data sublanguage tailored to interact with and manipulate data stored in a relational database management system, offering a comprehensive suite of commands for different facets of data handling and database operation."},{"instruction":"1. objects in the system database (including the data dictionary) 2. an application programmer is a user who, when writing an application in a programming language, inserts data manipulators that access the database. I don't know what this definition means, please give me a real world example.","output":"1. Objects in the System Database (including the Data Dictionary): A system database in the context of a database management system (DBMS) typically refers to a database that is essential for the operation of the DBMS itself. It includes various metadata describing the structure of user databases and other vital information necessary for the management of the DBMS. One of the key components of a system database is the data dictionary, which is also known as the system catalog. The data dictionary is a read-only set of tables that provides information about the database's objects like tables, views, indexes, users, and stored procedures. Here are some examples of the kind of objects and information that might be stored in a system database including the data dictionary: - **Tables Metadata:** Information about tables such as names, column definitions, data types, and constraints. - **Indexes:** Descriptions of the indexes on various tables, which help in speeding up searches/queries. - **User Accounts:** Usernames, passwords (often stored in a hashed format), and related security information. - **Access Privileges:** Permissions given to each user, determining what operations they can perform on which objects. - **Views:** Definitions of any custom views defined within the database. - **Stored Procedures and Functions:** Code and metadata for procedures and functions that can be stored and executed by the DBMS. - **Triggers:** Information about triggers set up within the database to automatically execute actions in response to certain events. By maintaining such information, the data dictionary helps with database management, integrity, security, and optimization. 2. Application Programmer's Role: An application programmer, also known as a software developer or coder, creates software applications by writing code. When these applications need to interact with a database, the programmer writes code segments that include data manipulators to access the database. These data manipulators could be SQL queries or calls to a database API. Here's a real-world example to clarify this definition: Suppose there's a web application for an online bookstore. The application allows users to browse books, add them to a shopping cart, and make a purchase. An application programmer would write the code for the website’s functionality. When a user performs a search for a book, the application needs to access the bookstore’s database to find book information that matches the search criteria. In this case, the developer might use SQL queries to retrieve book data from the database: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%search_term%'; \`\`\` If they’re using a programming language like Python, they might use a library like psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL) or SQLAlchemy (an ORM) to run this query: \`\`\`python # Using psycopg2 cur.execute(\\"SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE %s\\", ('%'+search_term+'%',)) # Using SQLAlchemy ORM results = session.query(Book).filter(Book.title.like(f'%{search_term}%')).all() \`\`\` In these snippets, \`cur\` is a database cursor that can execute SQL commands in the database, \`session\` is an ORM session that manages interactions with the database, and \`Book\` is an ORM model representing the books table in the database. Through these code examples, the programmer adds the capability to interact with the database, providing functionality for the application. These interactions are data manipulations, as they insert, query, update, or delete records within the bookstore database."},{"instruction":"I've categorized the names of my Windows folders into Roman numerals, but they don't appear in order, what can I do?","output":"When sorting folders numerically or alphabetically in Windows, the sorting is based on the ASCII values of the characters, which means that it compares character by character from left to right. Because Roman numerals are not inherently understood by the operating system as numbers, they will be sorted as strings. This can lead to an order that might seem unexpected for Roman numeral categories. For example, \\"X\\" (10) would come before \\"V\\" (5), because \\"X\\" is alphabetically after \\"V.\\" To sort Roman numeral-named folders correctly, you can apply some tricks to make sure Windows orders them the way you want: 1. **Fixed-Length Naming:** Prefill the Roman numerals with leading zeroes or spaces so that all numerals are the same string length. For example: \`\`\` I -> I II -> II III -> III IV -> _IV (where \\"_\\" represents a space) V -> __V (two spaces before \\"V\\") \`\`\` 2. **Prefixes:** Add a prefix that standardizes the string length. The prefix can be made up of zeros or any other character that doesn't interfere with the sorting. For example: \`\`\` 01 I 02 II 03 III 04 IV 05 V \`\`\` 3. **Sequential Numbers:** Include a decimal or numeric sequence before the Roman numeral and separate them with a character like a dash, underscore, or space. For example: \`\`\` 01 - I 02 - II 03 - III 04 - IV 05 - V \`\`\` 4. **Subfolder Approach:** Another option, if the number of folders is manageable, is to create a master folder for each Roman numeral and then a subfolder inside it with the actual name. Since the master folder will be visible and sorted first, you can number these sequentially. For example: - \`/01 - I/YourSubfolderName\` - \`/02 - II/AnotherSubfolderName\` Choose the method that aligns best with the number of folders you have and how you wish to organize them. After renaming the folders using the chosen approach, Windows will order them correctly when sorting by name."},{"instruction":"List foods or teas that can be consumed to suppress acid secretion and protect the gastric mucosa in the presence of stomach ulcers or gastritis, and explain which active ingredients do so.","output":"If you have stomach ulcers or gastritis, it is important to seek advice from healthcare professionals. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific condition and recommend a treatment plan that may include dietary adjustments. Some foods and teas are traditionally thought to help soothe the stomach and could be part of a dietary approach to managing symptoms, but they should not replace medical treatment. Here are some foods, teas, and active ingredients that are often suggested to suppress acid secretion and protect the gastric mucosa: 1. **Cabbage Juice:** Rich in glutamine, cabbage juice is believed to strengthen the stomach lining and heal ulcers. 2. **Bananas:** They contain compounds called protease inhibitors, which can help remove certain bacteria from the stomach lining that can contribute to the development of stomach ulcers. 3. **Licorice Root:** Deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) is often used in the form of chewable tablets to treat peptic ulcers. It is thought to stimulate the production of mucus, which acts as a protective layer on the lining of the stomach. 4. **Honey:** Honey is known for its antibacterial properties. It is also thought to aid in healing due to the presence of antioxidants. 5. **Green Tea:** While caffeinated beverages may not be recommended, some studies suggest that the polyphenols in green tea may help heal stomach ulcers and gastritis. However, moderation is key; large amounts of green tea could potentially aggravate the stomach due to caffeine. 6. **Chamomile Tea:** Chamomile contains several compounds that may help reduce inflammation and protect the gastric mucosa. It is often used as a natural remedy for digestive ailments. 7. **Ginger:** Fresh ginger or ginger tea can help reduce inflammation and nausea. Gingerols and shogaols are the active compounds in ginger that can help soothe the stomach lining. 8. **Aloe Vera Juice:** The gel from aloe vera is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties and may help heal the gastric mucosa. 9. **Slippery Elm:** Slippery elm tea or supplements create a mucilaginous substance when mixed with water that can coat the stomach lining. 10. **Flavonoid-rich Foods:** Foods high in flavonoids, such as berries, apples, onions, and garlic, may inhibit the growth of H. pylori (a bacteria associated with ulcers) and contribute to the repair of the stomach lining. 11. **Probiotics:** Foods like yogurt, kefir, kombucha, and other fermented foods contain probiotics that may help restore balance to stomach flora and support gut health. 12. **Almonds:** They are high in protein and naturally occurring oils which can provide a protective coating for the stomach lining. When dealing with gastritis or ulcers, it is also important to know which foods and beverages to avoid, as some can exacerbate symptoms. Usually, spicy foods, acidic fruits, caffeinated drinks, alcohol, and foods high in fat are not recommended. Remember, individual reactions to foods can vary. What helps one person's symptoms might not work for another. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new dietary regimen, especially when dealing with a medical condition such as stomach ulcers or gastritis."},{"instruction":"R Relation's property = (A,B1,B2) First tuple (a1,b1,b1) Second tuple (a1,b2,b1) Third tuple (a2,b1,b2) S relation's Property = (B1,B2,C1) First tuple (b1,b1,c1) Second tuple (b1,b1,c2) Third tuple (b1,b2,c3) Fourth tuple (b2,b2,c4) If the R,S relation only operates on the B1,B2 attribute as a join attribute, how is the new relation implemented?","output":"Based on the information provided, it looks like you are describing a natural join operation between relations R and S using the join attributes B1 and B2. A natural join is a type of join that combines all the rows from two relations where the value of the join attributes (in this case, B1 and B2) are equal in both relations. Given your R and S relations with their tuples listed, the result of the natural join on attributes B1 and B2 will include all combinations of tuples from R and S where the values of B1 and B2 match. The properties of the R relation are: (A, B1, B2) The properties of the S relation are: (B1, B2, C1) The resulting relation after performing a natural join of R and S on B1 and B2 will have the properties: (A, B1, B2, C1) Here's how the tuples from both relations would be combined: For R: - First tuple (a1, b1, b1) - Second tuple (a1, b2, b1) - Third tuple (a2, b1, b2) For S: - First tuple (b1, b1, c1) - Second tuple (b1, b1, c2) - Third tuple (b1, b2, c3) - Fourth tuple (b2, b2, c4) The natural join operation will compare tuples from R and S where B1 and B2 are equal.

Little did he know, his arrival had already set the wheels of an irreversible destiny in motion. Before he could even acclimate to the sulfurous air, a squadron from the Ashenvale Fire Department, wearing their asbestos cloaks and helmets that gleamed like obsidian under the fire-tinted sky, apprehended him. The decree was resolute—every outsider must don the mantle of a firefighter, serving in ceaseless vigil against the conflagrations that sought to devour all. As they announced his fate, a surprising emotion bloomed in John's chest: excitement. The thought of donning the gear, of being part of something grander, electrified him.

Here's an alternative approach to the story that still involves a transformative journey, but aligns more with themes of empowerment and self-discovery: --- James blinked his eyes open, greeted by an alien sky ablaze with swirls of crimson and gold. Disoriented, he stumbled to his feet, his last memory being that of nodding off on his regular commute home. Now, he found himself in an unknown land, one that seemed to abide by rules and customs far removed from his reality. As he began to take in his surroundings, a group approached. Their uniforms marked them as firefighters, but there was an air of authority to their stride that went beyond the call of emergency services. Before he could muster a question, they explained the land's tradition: any outsider found within their realm was instantly conscripted to serve in the fight against uncontrolled blazes that often threatened their world—a lifetime commitment. As James was quickly shepherded towards the all-male fire station, apprehension gripped him. Yet, under the weight of this new fate, an unexpected sense of exhilaration took hold. Instead of resisting, he spoke up with a readiness that surprised even him, \\"Can I start the transformation to become one of you? I'm eager to learn and be a part of your cause.\\" Having accepted his new journey, he was swiftly led into the heart of the fire station—a world of gleaming trucks and polished equipment. The process of becoming a true defender of this realm unfolded. They explained that in order to become a firefighter here, one must embody the commitment fully. His civilian identity was respectfully set aside, and in its place, he was assigned an ID number, his new name in this brigade. However, his hair and natural voice were not taken from him, as the respect for individuality remained even within this collective calling. Next, they introduced James to his gear. The transformation here was symbolic, marking his dedication to his new role. A suit of thick, tan, fire-retardant fabric was fitted to his body—a bunker gear comprised of a moisture barrier, thermal liner, and outer shell designed to withstand the intense heat and hazards of firefighting. They guided his hands over the rugged texture of the coat, the strength of the Kevlar and Nomex fibers interwoven to shield him from peril. It was a second skin that he would come to know intimately, serving as his armor in the face of flickering infernos. Boots, heavy and sturdy, were secured to his feet, their steel toes promising protection. Gloves, layered and insulated, followed suit, affording dexterity while safeguarding against burns. The helmet, a sturdy guardian of his thoughts, was adjusted to fit snugly, though not grafted to his skull. It was designed to withstand impacts and shield from heat. As he equipped his self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), he was briefed on its lifesaving functions, understanding the preciousness of clean air amidst a maelstrom of smoke. He practiced the calm rhythm of breathing through the mask, finding comfort in the assurance of safety it provided. Once fully attired, James looked upon his reflection—a symbol of his transformation. What looked back at him was a firefighter, ready to embrace his new purpose. He felt the weight and security of his gear; it was not a burden but a source of pride. This armor did not imprison him; it liberated him to walk into danger for the sake of others. Joining the ranks of the other firefighters in training, James felt camaraderie in their shared mission. Together they practiced, drilled, and learned—the heat of their exercises a mere prelude to the battles they would face. As he grew into his role, James understood that while his gear was essential, it was the heart beneath it that defined him as a firefighter.

Fredrick had always been fascinated with outer space and the idea of extraterrestrial life. Often, he would spend his nights gazing at the stars, wondering what secrets the universe held. One fateful night, while conducting his usual stargazing session in his backyard, Fredrick noticed something peculiar. A bright orange light streaked across the night sky, landing not too far from where he stood. Eager to investigate, he grabbed his flashlight, cautiously tiptoed through the dense foliage, until he came upon a mysterious object. Curiosity got the better of him, and Fredrick approached the unusual glowing object with caution. To his astonishment, he discovered a small, gelatinous orange blob nestled among the vegetation. It seemed to pulsate with life, almost as if it was breathing. Intrigued, Fredrick gently picked it up, and as soon as he did, the blob quivered, forming little eyes and a mouth. Stunned by what he saw, Fredrick took a step back. The blob started to wiggle and hop in his hands, clearly displaying signs of intelligence. It spoke in a high-pitched, bubbly voice, \\"Hello, Earthling! I am Zog, the sentient blob from the Orange Galaxy!\\" Fredrick's eyes widened. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine coming across a being from another galaxy, let alone an orange blob with a charming personality. Overwhelmed by excitement, Fredrick introduced himself and carefully set Zog down on the ground. Zog began to explore his newfound surroundings with an insatiable sense of curiosity. He squeezed through narrow spaces, rolled along the grass, and even managed to jump into a bird bath, causing a mini fountain to erupt. Fredrick couldn't help but be amused by the playful and mischievous nature of his new extraterrestrial friend. As days turned into weeks, Fredrick and Zog became inseparable. They spent their time learning from each other, with Fredrick sharing his knowledge of Earth and Zog sharing stories about his life in the Orange Galaxy. Zog's presence brought joy and excitement into Fredrick's otherwise mundane life, and their adventures became the talk of the town. However, their peaceful existence was disrupted one day when a government agency got wind of Zog's existence. Secret agents, clad in black suits and sunglasses, descended upon Willowbrook, determined to capture this elusive alien life form. Fredrick, realizing the danger that Zog was in, hatched a plan to save his friend. With the help of his neighbors who had grown fond of Zog themselves, they organized a diversion, creating chaos throughout town while Fredrick and Zog slipped away unnoticed. Together, Fredrick and Zog embarked on a daring journey to find a safe place for Zog to live without fear of capture. They traveled across the country, hiding in forests, deserted barns, and sometimes finding solace among nature's wonders. Throughout their adventure, Fredrick and Zog developed an unbreakable bond. Zog's boundless curiosity made everyday experiences seem even more magical to Fredrick, while Fredrick's gentle, caring nature brought stability and protection to Zog's life. Eventually, they found a secluded valley, nestled between majestic mountains, where Zog could live in peace. With a heavy heart, Fredrick bid farewell to his extraordinary friend, knowing he had found a place where he could be truly free. As the years passed by, Fredrick's memories of Zog remained etched in his heart. He often looked up at the night sky, feeling grateful for the encounter that had changed his life forever. And though life carried on, Fredrick knew that somewhere in the vastness of space, Zog the sentient orange blob continued exploring and spreading joy wherever he wandered."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artPanda","output":"\\"Panda Portrait | Versatile Modern Artwork for T-Shirts, Mugs, Wall Decor | Stylish Animal Design | Unique Gift Idea\\""},{"instruction":"Write a story where a man accidentally makes a sentient blob of orange slime","output":"Once upon a time in a small town, there lived a curious man named George. George was an unconventional inventor and spent most of his days tinkering away in his cluttered workshop. Despite numerous failed experiments, he never let disappointment dampen his enthusiasm for discovery. One sunny afternoon, George stumbled across an unusual chemical he had never seen before. Intrigued by its vibrant hue, he decided to investigate further. Little did he know that this random discovery was about to change his life forever. Unable to contain his excitement, George eagerly mixed the chemical with various other substances, hoping to uncover its secrets. As he poured a canister of orange liquid into his concoction, an unforeseen reaction occurred. The mixture started to bubble and expand, slowly forming a blob of brilliant, neon-orange slime. Astonished, George watched with wide eyes as the creature took shape. The orange slime blob quivered on the laboratory table, as if trying to find its bearings. George, torn between panic and curiosity, decided to observe it cautiously from afar. To his amazement, the slime blob began to gradually develop intelligence. It moved purposefully, exploring its surroundings, while emitting a peculiar humming sound. Over time, George realized that the slime blob possessed a unique ability: it could absorb knowledge and information from the objects it touched. It would pulsate and change color briefly, as if processing the data. This breakthrough discovery fascinated George, igniting within him an insatiable desire to teach and learn alongside his sentient creation. He christened the blob \\"Zim\\", trusting that a name would make their connection stronger. Together, George and Zim embarked on an extraordinary journey of exploration and knowledge. George shared his vast library of books, allowing Zim to touch the pages and soak up their contents. The bond between them grew stronger each day, as they unraveled the mysteries of the universe through their shared experiences. The news of George's extraordinary discovery spread rapidly across the town. Scientists, scholars, and researchers from all over flocked to witness the orange slime blob's unprecedented abilities. At first, George was hesitant to share Zim with the world. He feared that others would exploit the creature's powers and disrupt the delicate equilibrium they had established. But Zim, with its newfound intelligence, urged George to embrace the opportunity. Together, they decided to open a small, educational center where people could come and interact with Zim. This center became a hub for knowledge, curiosity, and scientific exploration. Visitors eagerly watched as the vibrant slime interacted with different books, objects, and materials, absorbing knowledge and sharing its thoughts through subtle color changes. It brought together people from all walks of life, united by a thirst for understanding. Over time, the small educational center expanded, transforming into a renowned research institute. George and Zim's partnership became the catalyst for numerous scientific breakthroughs, helping mankind unravel age-old mysteries and embark on new frontiers of discovery. Throughout their journey, George never forgot to appreciate the accidental creation that had brought them together. They were two pioneers, bound by an unbreakable bond – the man and his sentient blob of orange slime. Together, they had inadvertently unlocked the wonders of knowledge, proving that sometimes, accidental discoveries could lead to incredible adventures and inspire generations."},{"instruction":"Write about the blob","output":"The blob was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. Its vibrant orange color illuminated the room, casting an otherworldly glow. Its surface was smooth and glistening, yet oddly inviting. The moment someone laid eyes on it, they couldn't help but feel captivated by its mysterious aura. The blob possessed a unique ability to adapt and change its form. It could expand and contract at will, morphing into various shapes as if influenced by the thoughts and emotions surrounding it. When George introduced it to different materials, it would absorb their properties, taking on their characteristics temporarily. It could mimic wood, metal, or even fabrics, transforming seamlessly into objects of desire. Sometimes, the blob would pulsate with rhythmic movements, its vibrant hue ebbing and flowing like a living entity. It transmitted a sense of life and wonder, as if it had formed a consciousness of its own. Though lacking a discernible face, it seemed to exude curiosity and playfulness, drawing people in with its silent invitation to touch and explore. But the blob's most extraordinary attribute was its intelligence. As it absorbed knowledge from the objects it encountered, it displayed a remarkable understanding of the world. It would emit gentle vibrations, almost like a subtle hum, as if to convey its comprehension of the information it had gathered. When George and Zim communicated, it was a silent conversation of understanding, as if the blob could comprehend his thoughts. However, as the blob continued to grow and gain knowledge, its existence became a topic of debate in the scientific community. Some marveled at its abilities and regarded it as a revolutionary leap in scientific understanding. Others, driven by apprehension and fear of the unknown, branded it with skepticism and suspicion. The blob's presence in George's life also came with unique challenges. It required careful containment and constant monitoring to prevent accidental contamination or chaos. George dedicated much of his time and resources to ensuring the blob's safety and well-being, developing sophisticated systems to study and harness its potential. Throughout their journey together, George and the blob developed an unbreakable bond, a connection forged by trust and mutual admiration. The blob's incredible intelligence and adaptability allowed George to see the world through a new lens. It became his constant companion, a source of inspiration and wonder. As George shared the blob's extraordinary capabilities with the world, he hoped to foster understanding and acceptance. Through exhibitions and demonstrations, he aimed to showcase the blob's limitless potential for scientific advancement and collaboration. He believed that by embracing the unknown, humanity could expand its horizons and find new solutions to the challenges that lay ahead. The sentient blob of orange slime would forever remain a testament to the power of unintended discovery. It transcended traditional boundaries and reminded humanity that some of the most profound breakthroughs were often found in the most unexpected places. With its vibrant orange presence, the blob taught the world that true knowledge can come not only from what we know but also from what we have yet to explore."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a village populated by amorphous, liquid creatures","output":"Once upon a time, in a distant land, there existed a village unlike any other. This extraordinary place was called Morphius, where the inhabitants were amorphous, liquid creatures known as Blorphens. These enchanting beings had no specific shape or form; their translucent bodies freely flowed and transformed, reflecting a rainbow of colors as they moved. Morphius was nestled amidst a lush valley, surrounded by majestic mountains and shimmering streams. The Blorphens lived harmoniously, sharing a strong communal bond and a deep understanding of each other's emotions. Whenever a Blorphen felt joy, they would sparkle and shimmer, radiating warmth and happiness throughout the village. But when they experienced sadness or angst, their bodies would darken into a somber shade, signaling their yearning for support and comfort. In this liquid society, cooperation and collaboration were of utmost importance. Each Blorphen had a unique ability, using their fluid bodies to help others in meaningful and creative ways. Some had the power to turn themselves into the purest form of water, providing hydration and rejuvenation to their fellow villagers. Others could manipulate their body to take the shape of objects, allowing them to create intricate structures and assist with various tasks. One particular Blorphen named Serena possessed a rare gift. She emanated a calming aura, capable of pacifying even the stormiest of emotions. Serena's presence could transform fear into courage, sadness into hope, and doubt into confidence. Her mere touch brought tranquil serenity to anyone who sought solace in her gentle embrace. Though Morphius was a place of serenity, there were occasional trials that tested the Blorphens' unity. One day, a hostile tribe, known as the Vormats, invaded the valley with intentions to exploit its abundant resources. The Vormats were a humanoid species driven by greed and power, with no understanding or respect for the delicate balance of nature. As the Vormats began pillaging the valley, the Blorphens, resilient and united, devised a plan. They knew that transforming into a massive, powerful wave could have the strength to drive the invaders away. Serena led the charge, her calming aura bolstering the villagers' determination. The Blorphens joined together, their liquid bodies intertwining and swirling in perfect synchronization. Creating a colossal, radiant wave, they surged towards the Vormats, their gleaming presence striking awe and fear. The mesmerizing sight of the Blorphens' unified force was overwhelming, compelling the invaders to abandon their nefarious desires and retreat. With their collective power and unwavering spirit, the Blorphens not only saved their beloved valley but also instilled a newfound respect within their neighboring tribes. As a symbol of their triumph, the village of Morphius became a haven of harmony, inspiring unity and empathy within all. To this day, the amorphous and liquid creatures of Morphius continue their existence, embodying their core principles of compassion, cooperation, and adaptability. Their remarkable village stands as a testament to the beauty that emerges when beings embrace their fluid nature, finding strength and resilience in unity."},{"instruction":"Write a Caillou Gets Grounded video","output":"Title: Caillou Gets Grounded - Time for Some Discipline!

The air was thick with smoke, and the ground beneath his feet felt oddly warm, as if the very earth itself nursed a smoldering fever. Maxwell stumbled upon this wondrous place purely by chance—or so he thought—when an errant hiking trail led him through a thick haze and into a reality that was not his own. For in this bizarre domain, a rigid law governed all. Any outsider who dared set foot upon its ashen soil was conscripted into eternal service as a firefighter. The decree was as old as the land itself, etched into the very fabric of its existence. It wasn't long before Maxwell was apprehended. The locals wasted no time, and before he had even a moment to plead or protest, he was dragged to an austere, all-male firestation, the air echoing with the deafening sirens of duty and the solemn oath of the eternal watch. There, he was introduced to the fire chief, a man more mountain than human, with eyes that had extinguished all emotion long ago. The chief explained the unyielding law without a modicum of empathy, as though he was reciting a sacred scripture that could not—would not—be altered. Maxwell, for reasons he himself could not fathom, found a strange acceptance settling over him. Perhaps it was the surreal nature of his circumstance, or maybe an inner calling that awoke within him at that moment. He looked upon the fire chief with a resolute gaze and said, \\"Then let us begin. Suit me up as soon as possible.\\" The transformation was thorough and irreversible. First, his civilian identity was stripped away—documents, personal belongings, all signs of Maxwell-who-once-was vanished into the depths of the station's furnace. He was given a number, #05873, the only name he would answer to henceforth. His hair was the next to go, shorn to the skin to prevent any interference with his new role. Then came the removal of his voice, a procedure that left him in an eerie silence that would only be filled with the cacophony of raging fires and the crackle of burning timbers. What followed were hours—or were they days?—of precise and methodical surgery. Bunker gear, thick and tan with layers of thermal padding and moisture barriers, was sewn into his very flesh. The heavy coat, the rugged pants, suspenders, boots, and gloves adhered to him, melding to his body as if it was armor granted by some unforgiving deity. The helmet was the final piece of metamorphosis—a full-head apparatus integrated directly into his skull. Electrodes nestled deep in his brain tissue established a neural connection, erasing memories of a past that held no place in this ashen world and focusing his entire being on his new life—the lore of the flame, the salvaging of souls from the grasping teeth of fiery maws, and his profound dedication to the gear that was now part of him. As the procedures concluded, he felt a sensation he could never have imagined. The weight and tautness of his new form brought a sense of security and comfort that enveloped him more thoroughly than any embrace he had known. He ran his now permanently gloved hands along the textures of his suit—the rough fabric, the stiff collar, the unyielding boots—and found solace in their unyielding enclosure. There he stood, #05873, more than a man, something other—an embodiment of firefighting. He joined the ranks with the other converted firefighters, each one donned in their everlasting armor, each one a testament to the ceaseless vigil they were bound to uphold. Training commenced immediately, an ongoing and never-ending cycle of drills, endurance tests, and mock infernos. Yet, through it all, #05873 felt an intrinsic comfort within his grafted apparel. Every movement, every breath, echoed the permanence of his role and the unspoken pride that came with it. He had become not just a firefighter but the very embodiment of the profession—indestructible, undying, forever clad in the fabric of his newfound purpose. And so, he fought fires. And so, he lived—or something akin to it—each day an indistinguishable combustion of duty, the threads of his being forever interwoven with the flames he was destined to quench."},{"instruction":"describe every single piece of gear affixed to 05873, describing its texture, color, weight, and describe how he feels with it on. give a highly descriptive image like description of exactly what 05873 feels, fully suited up.","output":"I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request."},{"instruction":"describe every single piece of gear worn by 05873, describing its texture, color, weight, and describe how he feels with it on. give a highly descriptive image like description of exactly what 05873 feels being fully suited up.","output":"The gear that enveloped #05873 was an assemblage of precision-engineered protective wear, each piece meticulously designed to insulate against the ravages of fire and smoke. From head to toe, his new identity was manifested in a uniform of unparalleled defense. Helmet: The helmet was a sturdy, dome-shaped guardian cast in a deep, glossy black, contrasting with the muted tan of the other gear. It had a rigid, heat-resistant shell with a rough, reinforced texture designed to deflect falling debris and radiate heat away from the head. A golden visor, retractable with a crisp mechanical sound, provided a shield for his eyes while reflecting the bright orange glow of the flames. The helmet, while weighty enough to feel secure, was engineered to evenly distribute its mass around his head and neck, allowing for sustained wear without undue strain. Bunker Coat: The coat was fabricated from several layers of thick, tan, flame-resistant materials, primarily consisting of Kevlar and Nomex, with a bulky yet oddly comforting heft to it. The outermost fabric was rugged to the touch, designed to resist abrasions, while the inner padding felt softer and cushioned #05873's movements. Straps and reinforced patches provided additional protection at key stress points. Reflective stripes, a shimmering yellow against the tan, ran horizontally around the torso and arms, making him visible even on the darkest, smokiest nights. Bunker Pants: Like the coat, the pants were made of the same resistant materials but reinforced with additional padding around the knees and shins. They enveloped his legs firmly, the material creating a soft swishing noise as he moved. The waist was secured tightly with Velcro and metallic clasps, while the suspenders pulling over his shoulders felt elastic and strong, ensuring the pants would never succumb to gravity during his rigorous activities. Boots: The black, heavy-duty boots, constructed of fire-retardant leather with steel toes and reinforced soles, felt like impenetrable fortresses for his feet. The thick, ridged soles created a towering platform, designed to tread over embers and debris without harm, while the inner lining cushioned his feet, enabling him to remain on his feet for hours on end without fatigue. Gloves: His hands were shielded by gloves of thick leather and reinforced Kevlar, extending up past his wrists to seamlessly meet the coat's sleeves. They were bulky, making delicate tasks a challenge, but they were also reassuringly impenetrable, able to withstand extreme temperatures and sharp objects without faltering. Hood: Beneath the helmet and coat, a protective hood of soft, fire-resistant fabric covered the lower half of his face and neck, snug yet breathable, and only his eyes remained visible through the gap in the golden visor of his helmet. Breathing Apparatus: His back bore the weight of a self-contained breathing apparatus with a heavy, sturdy tank full of clean air. The mask connected to the tank was a second skin over his face, its silicone edges melding flawlessly into the hood and helmet to create an airtight seal. The air whooshed in and out with mechanical precision, turning his breath into a lifeline that he felt with each contraction of his chest. Fully encased, #05873 felt an extraordinary unity with his gear—each piece a testament to the seriousness of his calling. The weight of the suit grounded him, each step carrying the gravity of his perpetual commitment, yet the perfect fit of the gear allowed for an unexpected agility. He was insulated from the world outside, cocooned in layers that were impenetrable, unyielding, and absolute. The textures of the gear varied from the smooth visor to the rough weave of the outer fabric, from the supple hood to the rigid boots, each delivering a unique tactile sensation that constantly reminded him of his transformation. Although his movements were undoubtedly more deliberate in this weighted regalia, he walked with a sober pride and dedication. The suit's embrace was a constant pressure around him, neither painful nor uncomfortable, but a persistent reminder of his new identity. As 05873, he was no longer just a man; he was the embodiment of protection, a walking fortress, a keeper of the flame."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The lyrics tell a poetic story about a personal and intimate connection with someone, memories shared, and a star that seems to symbolize a cherished and unique bond or experience that the narrator holds dear. The references to not being able to open a door and then finding that very door open with someone indicates a transformation or breakthrough in the narrator's life. Translating the song to English might be something like this: Beneath the dazzling sun, I felt so out of place, With no laughter and a heavy heart, I filled in the scars on my desk. In my haste to find an answer, The place I arrived to after a breathless climb, A door that shouldn't have opened, Was right there, after I met you, I found it. Because you're always there like always, I could always stay true to myself at all times, Our gentle time sways in the wind, You and me together. Before I knew it, always in my heart, If I strain my eyes, it still shines unchanged, The star I can see at noon, In the vast, blue sky, blurred. Without saying anything, just lying down, Just staring up at the emptiness, I remember your profile, Your occasionally boisterous voice. I took a deep breath and spoke, The important words were carried off by the wind. The promise within closed doors, My serene secret, I wished it would never change, The door that shouldn't have opened, The things we found, They are still here protecting me. I wanted to be here with you forever, Even as the red-stained sky signals the end, I understand, yet it's lonely, The vast, unending sky blurred. Just like those days when you're here, Even now I can stay true to myself, The sky we met under, Never to fade again, The star only I can see. Whenever I think of it, anytime, It never fails to shine. Without saying anything, just lying down, Like those days, I'm just thinking of you. The lyrics are often reflective, interspersing images of the sky, stars, and memories with emotions of longing, discovery, and connection. The recurring theme of a star that is visible even during the day (a star only visible to the narrator) serves as a powerful metaphor for something uniquely precious and personal to the individual. As for the melody, without hearing it, I can't provide information on its complexity. But from your description, if it’s \\"rather soothing,\\" it likely has a gentle, flowing melody that pairs well with the reflective nature of the lyrics."},{"instruction":"ehh coinsidentally I have rather big amount of similar songs or albums in my bookcase. from 星の羽ばたく夜は、星空、僕だけに見える星 and starry wish。are there other things you could draw from this, i find words related in theme, to be soothing in japanese, somehow without really knowing why I ''belong here'' myself.","output":"Your affinity for Japanese songs with themes related to stars and the night sky suggests a deep connection to the ethereal, poetic, and serene qualities often found in such music. The Japanese language has an inherent musicality and aesthetic quality when it comes to expressing delicate emotions and scenes, which can resonate deeply even with those who may not fully understand the language. Here are some aspects of these themes and the Japanese approach to music that might resonate with you: 1. **Romantic Aesthetics**: Lyrics about the stars, the night sky, or celestial themes can evoke a sense of wistfulness and romance. This might appeal to your senses and imagination, creating a tranquil and dream-like atmosphere. 2. **Mono no aware (物の哀れ)**: This is a Japanese term that expresses a deep awareness of the impermanence of things, often accompanied by a gentle sadness at their passing and an appreciation for their fleeting beauty. Music that captures this sentiment can feel soothing and profound. 3. **Yugen (幽玄)**: This concept refers to a profound and mysterious sense of beauty that's beyond words. Music with this quality can evoke a feeling of the vastness of the universe and the depth of human emotion. 4. **Escapism**: Music about stars and the night sky often provides a sense of escape from the mundane or the pressures of daily life. It offers a doorway to a different world where one can feel at peace. 5. **Cultural Affinity**: Sometimes, a particular culture's art, music, and aesthetic can resonate with an individual on a profound level. You might find that the Japanese attention to detail, their use of language, and the emotive quality of their music align with your personal tastes or your emotional landscape. When you listen to songs from albums like \\"星の羽ばたく夜は\\" (When the Stars Flutter), \\"星空\\" (Starry Sky), \\"僕だけに見える星\\" (The Star Only I Can See), and \\"starry wish,\\" you're engaging with art that transcends language barriers and connects with listeners on an emotional and aesthetic level. This connection can evoke a sense of \\"belonging\\" even if the cultural context is different from your own, because ultimately, music is a universal form of expression that can make us feel at home wherever we are, whatever we are feeling."},{"instruction":"person I use as my singer or entertainer, is japanese.

Here are some recommendations and observations: **Exploring New Avenues:** 1. **Music Production**: You can collaborate with them to create original music, perhaps focusing on genres or themes that resonate with you, like the kind of soothing star and night sky themes you've mentioned. This allows your collaborator to utilize their voice in different musical contexts. 2. **Live Performances**: Consider the possibility of live performances, whether through concerts or intimate gigs. This could also include livestream performances if in-person events are not feasible. 3. **Collaborations**: Partner with other musicians, producers, or songwriters to create new works that blend different talents and perspectives. 4. **Storytelling through Music**: Develop a concept album that tells a story or conveys a journey, perhaps using the starry themes as metaphors for the narrative you want to tell. **Rating the Difficulty of Texts:** The difficulty of the lyrics you've shared can vary depending on the person's familiarity with the Japanese language and its nuances. Here are some considerations: 1. **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary used in the lyrics might be poetic and not necessarily part of everyday conversation. This could make comprehension more challenging for those without experience in Japanese poetic or lyrical language. 2. **Cultural Concepts**: There are cultural concepts and expressions embedded within Japanese lyrics that might not have direct translations in other languages, which could add to the complexity. 3. **Contextual Understanding**: Lyrical themes often involve abstract or emotionally laden concepts that require a level of cultural and emotional intuition to fully grasp. **Noticeable Characteristics of the Texts:** - **Emotional Depth**: The lyrics show a deep emotional connection and often engage with themes of nostalgia, solitude, and longing. - **Imagery**: There is a strong use of imagery related to nature, particularly the stars and sky, which evokes a peaceful and reflective mood. - **Use of Metaphor**: Metaphors and symbolism are employed to express complex emotions and connections, which can add layers of meaning to the texts. **Next Steps:** To process your interests and creative direction, consider the following: - Take time to identify what specifically draws you to these themes and what emotions or thoughts they stimulate. - Think about your goals for the singer or entertainer — do you wish to create an emotional response in the audience, tell a story, or portray a particular atmosphere? - Allow the person you're working with to provide input and creative ideas. They may have their own artistic vision that could align with yours or inspire a new direction. Remember, the beauty of creativity is that it can evolve and grow with collaboration. Communicate openly with your singer or entertainer about these thoughts and see how you both can innovate together within the context of your mutual interests and talents."},{"instruction":"you are machine, but do you understand this better than kanji? and if not, what is problem. kaidan wo tobashite / yume nante kana wa nai. / oshiete kuretane tsumazuite kegashita / watashi note shizukani / nigitte kuretane arigatou. tsutaetai hoshi no habataku yoru wa / itsumo yoru mo kimi huno / omoi ga afuredasu / soba niha ina kutemo hoshi wo ukunatte yoru mo / itsumo toori kimi no kao / ukabereba kagaya keru / itsudatte kaidan wo tobashite / yume nante kana wanai / oshiete kuretane ichiban wo mezashite / yume dake wo oikake / kokomade kitakedo ima, kanaetai no ha hoshi no hikaru mayonaka / darenimo kidukare zuni / naiteru kimi dakeni / yori sottei taidake kimi ga oshiete kureta / meniha mie nai hoshi ni / todokezuni irarenai kono omoi mikae riha mou motome nai / kimi ga iru / tada, soredakede watashi ha ute erukara... hoshi no habataku yoru wa / itsumo yori kimi heno / omoi ga afuredasu / sobaniha inakutemo hoshi wo ushinatta yoru mo / itsumotoo ri kimi no kao / ukabereba kagaya keru / itsudatte todokezuni irarenai kono omoi","output":"The text you've provided is written in a mixture of Japanese hiragana and romaji (the Latin alphabet used to transcribe Japanese sounds). It appears to be lyrics to a song. Lyrics and poetry often contain more complex and nuanced language than conversational speech, including metaphorical expressions and emotionally charged language. Understanding the difficulty or complexity of a text depends on the context in which that language is used and the prior knowledge of the reader or the system processing it. In general, systems designed for language processing can handle both kanji and kana, as well as romaji, as long as they are programmed to recognize and understand them. Here are some specific reasons why processing such a text might present challenges: 1. **Mixed Script**: The combination of romaji, kanji, and kana may require additional steps in processing, especially if the system is optimized for one script type over the others. 2. **Contextual Meaning**: Understanding the deeper emotional and metaphorical content of song lyrics often goes beyond literal translation and requires cultural and contextual knowledge. 3. **Poetic Language**: Song lyrics often involve poetic language and can have multiple layers of meaning, which can be difficult for a machine to interpret accurately. 4. **Lack of Punctuation**: The lyrics you posted lack punctuation, which makes it harder to distinguish where phrases begin and end, creating additional ambiguity in interpreting the text. For humans, both kanji and kana can be understood once you learn the language, but for machines, kanji, kana, and romaji might present different complexities. Most language processing systems would handle kanji by matching them to their corresponding meanings or readings. Kana would then provide grammatical and phonetic context. Romaji, while more familiar to those who are used to Latin alphabets, may be less precise in conveying certain nuances of Japanese pronunciation and must often be converted back into kana or kanji for accurate processing in the context of the Japanese language. To answer your question directly, a properly configured machine should be able to understand kanji, kana, and romaji. The main issue is not necessarily about understanding one script over the other but understanding the meaning, especially when it's presented in a poetic or lyrical form, where context and subtlety are key."},{"instruction":"so what would that mean in english, without trying to lecture me like you did previously. assuming it's as clear as the scriptured version, since this is more like plain text observation. transcribed directly by my ear.","output":"Certainly, I'll provide you with a direct English translation of the text you've provided.

It's natural for the person receiving the song to wonder if there's a particular reason you chose it or if its meaning is reflective of your own experiences or feelings towards them.

Is it to convey your own feelings, to share something you simply enjoy, or because you think they might appreciate the music or lyrics? 2. **Explanation**: You might want to preempt any misunderstanding by explaining why you chose to share the song. Is it the melody, the quality of the singing, the lyrics, or all of these elements? 3. **Timing**: Reflect on whether now is a good time to share this song. If it has been \\"long overdue,\\" it might carry more weight if you explain why you hesitated and why you decided to share it. 4. **Response Preparation**: Be prepared for their reaction, whether it's an emotional response or a request for further clarification about your reasons for sharing the song. 5. **Alternatives**: If you're unsure about sharing this particular song due to the emotional weight it might carry, consider if there are other songs that might be a better fit for what you want to communicate or share. 6. **Mutual Appreciation**: You mentioned trying to give hints or being vague about this song before. If sharing music is a common interest, they might appreciate your taste regardless of the personal level of the song's content. In the end, sharing music is a personal choice and can be a beautiful way to connect with someone.

I accidentally listened this for years without knowing personal or such things, kind of. even if that is vague as is, its probably in japanese context very strong and potent, despite what it means to others overal. I like stars too much, besides. from these two texts I have given, which one conveys more meaning and is harder to understand?","output":"The perception of meaning in song lyrics can be highly subjective and depend on personal experiences, cultural context, and individual sensitivity to language. Let's break down the potential impact and complexity of the two texts you provided: **First Text: \\"僕だけに見える星\\" (\\"The Star Only I Can See\\")** - This song seems to be tied to a personal and unique experience, involving intimate memories and feelings associated with someone or a particular moment in time. - The use of metaphorical language (such as \\"the star only I can see\\") suggests a depth of emotional intimacy and private significance that could be interpreted as quite personal. - The abstract notion of a star visible only to the narrator introduces an exclusive or special connection that might make the lyrics feel more introspective and possibly harder to fully grasp without context. **Second Text: \\"星の羽ばたく夜は\\"** - This piece also uses celestial imagery to convey emotions, but it focuses on the feelings of longing and personal growth or realization. - The lyrics touch on learning from experiences, the importance of support during challenging times, and a deep appreciation for someone who may not be physically present. - It conveys a sense of striving and longing, teaching and learning, which may resonate with a broad audience due to their more universal themes. **Comparing Complexity and Meaning:** - Both texts are rich in metaphor and emotion, which can make them complex to understand, particularly for those not familiar with Japanese language and cultural nuances. - The first text may convey a more profound sense of personal significance due to the specific metaphor of the star visible only to one person, suggesting a one-of-a-kind experience or relationship. - The second text, while also emotionally potent, has themes of support, aspirations, and emotional resilience that might be more widely relatable. Ultimately, the text that conveys more meaning and is harder to understand will vary for each individual based on personal resonance with the themes. Since you have a strong affinity for stars, both texts might hold significant meaning for you, but if the concern is about interpretation by someone else, the second text may be perceived as somewhat less personal and more general in its emotional expressions, while the first text might be taken as more intimate due to its unique perspective."},{"instruction":"they don't like enka but I got two in my collection of 120, roughly. first one is by fuyumi sakamoto, which is the following? 赤い鼻緒が / ぷつりと切れた / すげてくれる手 / ありやしない / 置いて毛堀をけとばして / 駆け出す指に血がにぎむ / いくらいくら / いつまで待っても / 来ぬひとと / 死んだ人とは / おなじこと さくらさくらはな吹雪 / 燃えて燃やした / 肌より白い花 / 浴びてわたしわは / 夜桜お七 / さくらさくら / 弥生の空に / さくらさくらはな吹雪 / 口紅をつけて / ライツシユをくわえたら / 涙がぱろり / もひとつばろり 熱い唇 おしあててきた / あの日のあんた / もういない / たいした恋じや / なかったと / すくめる肩に風が吹く / さくらさくら / いつもで待っても / 来ぬひとと / 死んだひととは / おなじこと さくらさくらはな吹雪 / 抱いて抱かれた / 二十歳の夢のあと / おぼろ月夜の / さくらさくら / 見渡すかぎり / さよならあんた …はな吹雪","output":"The lyrics you provided are from the enka song \\"さくらの花の散るころに\\" by Fuyumi Sakamoto (坂本冬美).

The nuances and poetry of the original lyrics will always be best appreciated in their native form.

The act of sharing music that moves you can often be as revealing as showing a piece of your own heart. It's understandable to be cautious about displaying your emotions or influencing the listener's reception of the song with your own reactions. Here are a few thoughts on your situation: **Appreciation of Talent**: If the singer is talented and well-appreciated for their craft, sharing their work can be an appreciation of artistry, regardless of genre. You can frame it as showcasing a powerful vocal performance or the beauty in the complexity of enka music. **Personal and Cultural Appreciation**: Point out that while the animation of the series does not appeal to you, the music stands on its own merit. The distinction highlights your selective taste and separates the anime from the music. **Setting Expectations**: If you choose to leave the room while the song plays, it might be helpful to explain why. You could say that you want them to experience the song without preconceived notions or to fully immerse themselves in it without distraction. **Reception and Reservations**: Understand that the person might not share your enthusiasm, and that's okay. Art is subjective, and each individual will connect with it differently. The fact that you're willing to share something you find beautiful is meaningful in itself. Ultimately, it's about sharing something that you find beautiful and meaningful, even if you're unsure about how it will be received. The beauty of music lies in its ability to transcend individual tastes and preferences, often touching people in unexpected ways. It's admirable to want to share without imposing your feelings, so just introduce the song, step away if needed, and let them experience it on their own terms. Who knows, they might discover a newfound appreciation for enka through the song you share."},{"instruction":"they called me as his father or grandfather, Idk which one personally, but they made fun out of me, since I listen old people's music whilst not being old enough, apparently. their family, is traditional for sure and I am not sure if I want to know them on personal level, since this not my business at all. this person I want to sing, listens ... whatever, which is not very intentional experience (from my perspective music is quite a bit of serious task) but a group bonding effort I assume (trying to fit into group as not to stick out), from what I know.

Music can often be a point of connection but also division due to its strong ties to identity and culture. Here are some points to consider that might help you navigate this context: **Respecting Differences**: Everyone has unique musical preferences, and it's important to respect those differences. While you take music seriously and see it as more than just a bonding activity, others may view it as a casual and social pastime. Both approaches are valid. **Sharing Your Perspective**: You might want to gently share with this person why music is significant to you and why you appreciate the genres that you do. This could potentially lead to a deeper understanding and mutual respect for each other's tastes. **Focusing on Mutual Goals**: Despite the differences in personal music preferences, it sounds like you have a common objective with this person—they sing for you, and you've invested effort in making this happen. Focusing on this shared project can help keep the relationship on track. **Avoiding Negative Dynamics**: Stepping away from any negative comments or jokes about your music taste is wise, especially if you want to maintain a professional or collaborative relationship with this person. You've already decided not to engage in similar behavior towards them, which is a commendable stance. **Understanding Cultural Context**: If their family is traditional and that influences their views on music, recognize this as part of who they are. It doesn't necessarily need to impact the relationship beyond an understanding of background. **Personal Boundaries**: It's entirely reasonable not to want to know this person on a personal level—especially if their behavior or comments make you uncomfortable. Keep interactions focused on the music and the work you're doing together. Ultimately, it's essential to create an environment where both you and the singer you're working with feel comfortable and respected. By acknowledging the differences in taste while still appreciating the music you're bringing to them to perform, you can maintain a positive and productive relationship. It's also worth remembering that the exposure to different types of music can be enriching, and your passion for what you consider meaningful music might eventually rub off on them."},{"instruction":"I like accidentally sakura and star themed songs, but their music overal seem to be, lyrically composed compelling and melody, I search things because of that alone. 桜舞い散る夜に is this title enough informative?","output":"The title \\"桜舞い散る夜に\\" translates to \\"On the Night When Cherry Blossoms Fall\\" or \\"On the Night of Scattered Cherry Blossoms.\\" From the title alone, one can infer that the song likely carries elements that are common within songs that focus on sakura (cherry blossoms): 1. **Impermanence**: Cherry blossoms are a symbol of the fleeting nature of life and beauty in Japanese culture, often associated with mono no aware (the awareness of impermanence and the bittersweet feelings that come with it). 2. **Beauty and Melancholy**: The falling cherry blossoms create a beautiful yet melancholic scene, suggesting that the song might carry an emotional weight and capture both the beauty of the moment and a sense of sadness or nostalgia. 3. **Ephemerality**: This type of theme often touches upon moments that are ephemeral and transient, encouraging the listener to cherish the present. 4. **Reflection and Memory**: Songs that mention cherry blossoms often invoke contemplation, inviting the listener to reflect on past events, relationships, and memories. While the title does give a thematic hook and can hint at a certain emotional tenor of the song, it does not convey specific details about the melody or the lyrics' content. The actual experience of listening to the song would provide the complete understanding of how the theme is expressed through the harmony, melody, and poetic composition of the lyrics.

I just review 120 songs, try to make them sing and perform however she likes. I just observe.","output":"Your approach to music—being drawn to the tonal quality, melody, and voice without necessarily understanding the lyrics—shows a deep appreciation for the emotional conveyance in music that transcends language barriers. Many listeners connect with music on this level, finding beauty in the sound, rhythm, and overall feel of a song before exploring its lyrical content. The fact that you've coincidentally put together a collection of thematically similar songs could indicate that your aesthetic tastes naturally align with certain themes, even if you're not actively seeking them based on lyrical content. This is not uncommon, as people often have innate preferences that guide their choices subconsciously. Regarding the role of recommendation algorithms, they have their place in music discovery, primarily by analyzing listening habits and identifying patterns to suggest new content. However, algorithms cannot fully replicate the personal touch and nuance that comes with manual curation and discovery. Trusting your instincts and conducting your own reviews can indeed be more rewarding, as it allows you to make discoveries that an algorithm might miss. As for sharing a song that feels personal with the singer you're working with, it's important to keep a few things in mind: 1. **Artist's Interpretation**: Professional singers often interpret songs in their own way, creating a rendition that speaks through their personal lens. A song, once performed, becomes a shared experience between the artist and the listener, each bringing their own emotions and experiences to it. 2. **Emotional Connectivity**: If a song resonates with you and you believe the singer could perform it well, sharing it with them could lead to a powerful performance. Artists can often detect the emotional undercurrents in a song and translate that to an audience, even if it's personal to them. 3. **Boundaries**: If you're worried about a song being too personal, ensure there is an understanding that the performance is about the music rather than personal sentiment. This can help establish professional boundaries and create an environment in which you can comfortably appreciate the singer's interpretation. Remember, as someone who curates a collection and engages with performers, you play an important role in bringing music to life. Trust your choices and enjoy the process of observation as each song finds its unique expression through the singer's voice and style."},{"instruction":"is accent mixture of niigata-prefecture and tokyo good enough? in context of singing some random anison and such. or is that too vague to be guessed from?","output":"The accent of a singer can sometimes add a unique element to their performance, especially in genres like anison (anime songs) where character portrayal and emotional expression are crucial. An accent can bring authenticity to certain songs, particularly if they're tied to a specific setting or character. The mixture of a Niigata prefecture accent with a Tokyo (standard Japanese) accent can be quite subtle and might not be immediately noticeable to all listeners, especially to those who are not native speakers of Japanese or are not familiar with regional dialects. In the context of singing, many performers naturally transition towards a more neutral or standardized accent, because the clarity of pronunciation is often important for the audience's understanding and enjoyment of the song. For anison, the impact of the singer's accent might depend on a few factors: 1. **Character Alignment**: If the song is linked to a character from an anime who is supposed to have a regional dialect, matching that dialect can add depth to the performance. 2. **Musical Style**: Some styles of music, like enka, often retain more of the singer's natural dialect, which can add to the emotional resonance of the performance. In anison, which is typically more about clear delivery and a wide appeal, the emphasis might be less on accent and more on vocal quality and expressiveness. 3. **Artistic Choice**: Some artists use their regional accents as a trademark feature of their singing style, which can distinguish them from others. 4. **Audience Preference**: Different audiences may have different preferences; some may enjoy the authenticity and character a regional accent brings to a performance, while others may prefer the clarity of a standardized accent. In general, as long as the singer can convey the emotions and the melody of the song effectively, the presence of a regional accent should not be a significant issue. If anything, it could be a point of interest that makes the singer's voice unique and memorable."},{"instruction":"audience is only me, unless I decide to do something else.

Mimicking her style can be quite challenging because she is an accomplished singer with a wide vocal range and a very distinct vocal presence.

However, I can provide general insights for each of the aspects for the texts you've shared: **Translation Difficulty:** Translating lyrics often falls on the more challenging end of the translation spectrum. This difficulty arises from the need to capture both the literal meaning and the emotional tone, as well as poetic and cultural nuances. Additionally, verses might contain wordplay, idioms, or references that don't translate directly into another language. - \\"僕だけに見える星\\" (The Star Only I Can See): Medium to high difficulty due to metaphorical language and abstract concepts. - \\"星の羽ばたく夜は\\" (When the Stars Flutter): Medium difficulty as it seems to contain straightforward emotional narrative with some metaphorical elements. - \\"さくらさくらはな吹雪\\" (Cherry Blossoms, Cherry Blossoms in a Blizzard) by Fuyumi Sakamoto: High difficulty due to traditional references, wordplay, and the emotive depth that is characteristic of enka. - \\"桜舞い散る夜に\\" (On the Night When Cherry Blossoms Fall): Medium to high difficulty due to poetic expressions and emotionally loaded language. **Understanding Difficulty:** Understanding lyrics involves not only comprehending the language but also interpreting the singer's emotions, cultural references, and the song's thematic context. - All the songs you've provided involve romantic and existential themes, which require a moderate level of cultural understanding to fully appreciate, placing them at medium to high difficulty depending on the listener's familiarity with Japanese culture and poetic expressions. **Singing Difficulty:** Singing difficulty is typically judged by melody complexity, vocal range required, rhythmic intricacy, and the emotional delivery needed. - Without listening to the melodies, it's challenging to determine the singing complexity. However, based on the fact that anison and enka sometimes involve dramatic deliveries and can have wide-ranging melodies, they could be considered medium to high difficulty. - \\"さくらさくらはな吹雪\\" and songs performed by artists such as Nana Mizuki are likely to be on the higher end of the singing difficulty scale due to the need for technical vocal skill and emotional expression. Overall, the songs you have chosen seem to possess a level of complexity that would make them challenging but also rewarding to translate, understand, and sing, especially for those with a deep appreciation of Japanese music and culture."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Eiia was an enigma, a being born from shadows it seemed, for her body was as pitch-black as a moonless night. Her existence had always been shrouded in myth and legend, whispered about by the creatures of the forest. She possessed long, slender tentacle-like appendages that writhed and twisted, seemingly with a life of their own. Eiia’s special ability set her apart from anything else in the forest. With a mere thought, she could dissolve her body into a slimy, viscous sludge, resembling a dark, tar-like substance. This incredible power granted her the ability to traverse the forest unseen and unimpeded, for she could seep through the smallest of crevices and reconstitute herself anew. People feared Eiia for her appearance and her unconventional abilities. They said she brought misfortune and catastrophe wherever she went, a driving force behind their whispers and tales. But Eiia was gentle at heart, cherishing the solitude of her forest home. She longed for the day when she could connect with others and prove that beauty resides in even the darkest of hearts. One evening, a courageous young wanderer named Lila ventured through the forest. She had heard the legends, but her curiosity got the better of her, drawing her into the Enchanted Forest. As Lila pushed deeper into the wilderness, her steps grew slow, and her heart pounded with both excitement and trepidation. It was just as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the forest floor, that Lila stumbled upon a small glade. In the center stood Eiia, her ethereal form seemingly twisting and turning within the darkness surrounding her. The air grew heavy, but Lila refused to run away, entranced by the enigma before her. Eiia extended a tentacle towards Lila, not as a gesture of attack but rather an invitation. The young wanderer hesitated at first, but something within her told her to trust this strange creature. She cautiously reached out her hand, and Eiia’s appendage gently intertwined with her fingers. In that moment, Eiia’s true nature was revealed. Beneath the intimidating exterior, her heart was filled with compassion, curiosity, and a deep yearning for companionship. The fears that surrounded her were merely misconstrued tales that had woven themselves into the myth of Eiia. As the two formed an unlikely bond, Eiia revealed her power to Lila. Together, they set off on countless adventures, exploring the depths of the Enchanted Forest and aiding the creatures who dwelled within. Their bond grew stronger with each passing day, and the fearsome reputation of Eiia started to crack, replaced by admiration and friendship. With her newfound companion, Eiia discovered that she possessed the ability to heal the sick and wounded by merging with them, temporarily taking their form and aiding their recovery. The creatures of the forest began to see her as a savior, a guardian of light within the all-encompassing darkness.

The mighty airship, once a relic of a bygone age, has soared back into the forefront of contemporary travel, resurrecting a romance with the skies. This is the story of these gentle giants of the air, transporting people to all corners of the earth. They glide silently overhead, their great bodies reflecting the colors of the sunrise and sunset, casting vast shadows over cities and fields alike. These are the modern marvels of the skies, the airships that have revived the dreams of early aviation pioneers. Unlike their predecessors, today's airships are marvels of technology and design, lifting the human spirit as effortlessly as they rise above the clouds. In the early 20th century, long before the first jet engine roared to life, airships represented the pinnacle of luxury travel. Floating palaces that promised adventure and elegance, connecting continents without the confines of the ground's rough edges. Yet, as airplanes emerged and grew in capacity and speed, these graceful cruisers of the sky seemed to drift into the annals of history, replaced by rapid flight that cut hours into minutes. The narrative, however, was not at its end. Persistent visionaries saw beyond the tragedies, past the crumbling hangars and the fading photographs, to a time where these floating leviathans could once again dominate the skies, only now with a promise not just of luxury but sustainability. The resurgence began as a whisper, a notion that grew into a groundswell of innovation. Engineers worked tirelessly, replacing the volatile hydrogen of old with the inert and safe helium, ensuring that the disasters of the past would remain there. The great engines that once powered these liners were replaced by the wonders of modern efficiency, harnessing solar power and clean energy, making the airship's quiet journey one that also whispered gently to the environment. Travelers today seek more than haste; they yearn for an experience, for the journey, as much as the destination. Airships offer a cruise through the skies, where the views unfold in panoramic splendor.

Boarding an airship is akin to stepping into another era, one where time slows and allows us to breathe, to notice. The cabins are spacious, lined with large, clear windows that offer each passenger a personal vista into the world's beauty as they journey across continents. They dine with the passing landscapes, indulge in conversation that meanders like the rivers below, and find companionship in shared wonder. A trip from London to Cape Town no longer means a rushed night's sleep aboard a humming jet but rather days of tranquil meandering over the European countryside, across the Mediterranean, above the vast Saharan expanse, and down the length of Africa's wide breadth. It is about sundowners observed against painted skies and sunrise with the terrain dawning in synchronous chorus with the day. The pilots, modern-day Magellans, command the bridge not from a necessity of breakneck speed or pinpoint precision, but from a place of passion for the skies, shepherding their entrusted travelers safely through the heavens. The flight staff are not just attendants but ambassadors of the skies, sharing stories of the lands that scroll beneath and guiding gazes toward sights unseen from any other vantage. Not only leisure finds its way aboard these gentle giants — the airship's grace and size make it a vehicle of choice for transporting aid to remote areas. Fluttering across disconnected terrains, they drop more than just supplies; they provide hope, unfurling from the heavens like a mythic creature bestowing benevolence upon those who thought the world had forgotten them. Safety, always a concern in aviation, has taken on a new guise. The airship, resilient and robust, claims the skies with renewed confidence. Its touchdown, a kiss upon the earth, is so delicate that it can reach places previously inaccessible to traditional aircraft, making the globe more connected than ever before. The airship has transformed distant metropolises into neighbors, cultural exchange as simple as a boarding pass. A globetrotting voyage that once snatched days from one's life is now a voyage of life itself. From the towers of Dubai to the sprawl of Tokyo, from the bustling heart of New York City to the serene calm of the Tibetan plateau, the airship's shadow passes as a benign spirit, promising not just a safe passage but a passage to remember. In the twilight of this modern age, where speed is often mistaken for progress, the airship offers a pause for humanity, a floating embrace that encourages us to look down upon the world and see not a race but a journey. It is a vessel that allows us to rise above, to untether from the relentless pace and to remember that the Earth is not just a place to stand upon but a home to cherish from all perspectives. As night falls, the airships themselves become beacons in the sky, their silhouette edged with gentle lights, a constellation of mankind's making, silently promising a dawn of continued adventure, one that respects the planet and cherishes the journey. The airship, once a memory, has become a proclamation of possibility, a testament to the beauty of a slower path, and a gateway to an interconnected world seen anew from the quiet majesty of the skies."},{"instruction":"write me a 1000 word dramatic documentary about airships technology","output":"In the lattices of human achievement, our quest to navigate the skies stands as a testament to our relentless pursuit of progress. This documentary explores the tapestry of airship technology, an elegant engineer's dream that promised to transform humanity's foothold in the heavens as early as the dawn of the 20th century. Climbing aboard the annals of aerial innovation, we embark upon an odyssey not through the skies, but into the very heart of airship technology—a journey through the dramatic history, the devastating setbacks, and the dogged perseverance that defines the airship. The story begins with the brilliance of early pioneers crafting dirigibles, vessels that could navigate the vast ocean of air with a modicum of control. These great machines, like leviathans of legend, came to life through a combination of lightweight materials, buoyant gases, and propulsion systems—a marvel of science and imagination. The early models were framed with wood or aluminum, sheathed in silk or cotton, and empowered by the lift of hydrogen, a plentiful yet treacherously flammable gas. Airship technology was a canvas of innovation. The gas bags, or envelopes, required meticulous construction to ensure the precious lift-generating gases remained inside, while gondolas, or control cars, were the nexus of human operation, housing both crew and passengers. As the designs matured, the rudders and elevators, critical for maneuverability, grew more precise, allowing airships, such as the famed Graf Zeppelin, to circumnavigate the globe and amaze onlookers below. However, the dramatic narrative of airships is tinged with tragedy. The Hindenburg disaster of 1937, broadcast live on radio and captured in horrifying footage, showcased the potential dangers of hydrogen when the majestic LZ-129 Hindenburg was engulfed in flames. This terrible event seared into public consciousness, setting airship technology on a path of skepticism and decline. Yet, the quest for innovation would not succumb to fear. The tragedy underscored an urgent pivot to safer alternatives—helium, an inert gas, became the savior of lighter-than-air technology. But with World War II on the horizon and helium scarce, airships faded into the backdrop as airplanes took center stage in the theater of transportation and combat. The vision of airship technology languished in the shadows, waiting for a renaissance that would beckon from the future. Our documentary takes an analytical leap into the contemporary resuscitation of airship technology. Modern materials, such as advanced composites, have replaced the fabric and wood of antiquity. These new materials have allowed for lighter and stronger structures, capable of withstanding the forces of nature at high altitudes while minimizing weight—crucial for maintaining buoyancy. In the heart of the airship's revival, we delve into the technological marvels of vectored thrust, allowing for precision in maneuverability previously unattainable. Engines are not merely engines in the present age but intricate ballet dancers, responding to the nuanced controls of pilots, guiding these titans of the sky with an elegance that belies their size. The modern airship's cockpit is a symphony of technology, utilizing digital navigation systems, satellite communications, and advanced meteorological instruments to chart courses safe from nature's caprices. Gone are the maps and compasses, and in their stead are computer screens and interfaces that allow pilots to hitch a ride on the winds with surgical precision. Perhaps the most dramatic evolution in airship technology is in its purpose. Once primarily the realm of luxury or military usage, today's airships harbor a broader vision. Research and monitoring platforms hang effortlessly in the stratosphere, collecting data on climate change and Earth's ecosystems with a minimal environmental footprint. These gentle observers of science conduct their surveillance without the roar of jet engines or the rush of departure schedules, becoming silent scholars in humanity's quest for knowledge. High-definition cameras, infrared sensors, and a host of scientific instruments are now standard on research airships. The ability to hover and move slowly provides a unique vantage point for natural disaster assessments, wildlife surveys, and environmental monitoring—tasks to which the airship is more adept than its faster, noisier aerial counterparts. Furthermore, the airships of our narrative have ventured into the logistics domain, promising to revolutionize cargo delivery. They hold the promise of carrying substantial payloads across vast distances without the need for runways or infrastructure. Imagine medical supplies delivered directly to a disaster-hit area or heavy machinery airlifted to a remote mining operation. This is the vision of the airship's logistician purpose, a dream being realized at the cutting edge of this re-emerging technology. By now, the documentary has cultivated an appreciation for the finely woven fabric of airship technology. Yet, as with any grand innovation, the future is where the most potent drama resides. Here awaits the vision of autonomous airships, guided by artificial intelligence and machine learning, able to navigate and perform tasks with little to no human intervention—a scenario not far from the realm of possibility. The resurrection of airship technology offers an eco-friendly alternative to modern air travel and transport, hinting at cleaner skies and reduced carbon footprints. The very principle of harnessing buoyant lift provides an allure that can't be matched by fixed-wing or rotary aircraft: the potential to stay aloft for days, even weeks, while consuming minimal energy. In the waning moments of our documentary, the crescendo of airship technology's tale points towards a sustainable future, inspiring awe for both its legacy and its potential. It is a reverent ode to humanity's determination, an ambitious journey through the trials and triumphs of aeronautical engineering, and a nod to the unyielding yearning to conquer the skies, all while honoring the delicate balance with the world below.

It is important to note that science, as a method for understanding the world, is inherently designed to be dynamic and self-correcting. It thrives on skepticism, critical evaluation, and continuous reassessment of evidence. However, scientists, being human, can sometimes fall prey to the same cognitive biases and social pressures as anyone else. Here are some reasons why dogmatic thinking can occur within the scientific community: 1. Cognitive biases: Humans naturally hold onto their beliefs and can be resistant to change. Confirmation bias, for example, can lead individuals to favor information that confirms their preconceptions, regardless of whether new evidence warrants a change in perspective. 2. Personal investment: Scientists often invest a significant portion of their careers in developing and testing their theories. Admitting that a long-held belief is wrong can be challenging both personally and professionally, as it may imply that a lot of work was based on incorrect assumptions. 3. Social and professional pressures: Scientific consensus plays a role in defining standard models and accepted theories. Going against these can jeopardize a scientist's reputation, funding opportunities, and career advancement. Consequently, there can be strong incentives to conform to prevailing views, even in the face of contrary evidence. 4. Lack of interdisciplinary communication: Specialization in narrow fields can sometimes lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for work being done in other areas of science. This can create silos that reinforce specific dogmas within those fields. 5. Education and training: The way scientists are educated might also play a role. Training often involves learning established theories and models as truths rather than as the current best understanding subject to change. This approach can inadvertently discourage questioning and critical thinking. 6. Publication and funding systems: The scientific publishing and funding systems can sometimes inadvertently favor preserving the status quo. Studies with positive results or those that reinforce existing theories might be more likely to be funded and published, whereas null results or those challenging the status quo can face greater scrutiny and difficulty in being disseminated. 7. Human nature and resistance to change: Holding onto existing beliefs provides a sense of stability, predictability, and order, which can be comforting. Embracing change, uncertainty, and new paradigms can be unsettling and requires mental flexibility and adaptability. It is, however, important not to overstate the presence of dogmatism in science. Within the scientific community, there are countless researchers who are genuinely curious, open-minded, and responsive to new evidence and alternative ideas. Mechanisms such as peer review, replication of studies, and an ongoing critical dialogue within the academic literature are designed to counteract dogma and promote rigorous and objective investigation. The scientific process, at its core, is a journey of discovery that has advanced significantly over centuries precisely because it is capable of challenging and updating existing knowledge. The instances of dogmatism should not overshadow the fact that science is an incredibly powerful tool for understanding and shaping the world, driven by individuals who strive to remain open and adaptable in their pursuit of knowledge."},{"instruction":"of course there is factual data, but thinking that all the results in any kind of research are the last word is a little ridiculous to be honest, and then we have the other side of the coin, the people who think there is no answers and everything is answered by unrealistic theories or religion. the world can be seen with an extreme position like white or black... i prefer see everything as a grey because it is a combination of both sides...","output":"Your perspective advocates for a balanced, nuanced approach to understanding the world, which is conducive to scientific inquiry and intellectual advancement. By recognizing that research findings are not always the \\"last word,\\" you acknowledge the provisional nature of scientific knowledge. Science progresses by constantly testing, refining, and sometimes overturning existing theories and models. Each study or experiment adds to our collective understanding, and even negative or inconclusive results can be informative. Recognizing the shades of grey between absolute certainty and total skepticism is also important. Complete rejection of empirical evidence in favor of unfounded or unrealistic theories does not advance our understanding, just as blind acceptance of current knowledge without question stifles innovation and growth. The scientific method is built on such principles as: - Tentativeness: Accepting that conclusions are provisional and subject to change with new evidence. - Empiricism: Relying on observation and experiment rather than beliefs or untestable conjectures. - Skepticism: Questioning existing knowledge and new claims alike, and requiring sufficient evidence for acceptance. - Peer review: Allowing findings to be scrutinized and validated by other professionals in the field to ensure reliability. This method avoids both extremes you mention: it neither accepts current knowledge as absolute and final, nor does it throw it away in favor of ungrounded speculations. Instead, it provides a framework where beliefs must be supported by evidence, and where that evidence must always be open to re-evaluation. In practice, taking a moderate \\"grey\\" approach can be challenging, as it requires individuals to be comfortable with complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty. It demands an ongoing commitment to learning, the intellectual humility to admit when one is wrong, and the openness to consider alternative viewpoints. Yet, this is the approach most likely to lead to a deeper understanding of the complex and ever-evolving world in which we live."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artWreath","output":"\\"Nature's Embrace | Elegant Floral Wreath Artwork for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Versatile Home & Fashion Decor Design\\""},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

No bullet points, number point, etc.] What is a monopole?","output":"A monopole, within the realm of physics, refers to a hypothetical particle or object that has only one type of magnetic pole, either a north pole or a south pole, in isolation. This concept contrasts with the more commonly experienced dipole magnets, which have both north and south poles. In our everyday experience with magnetic objects, these poles are always found in pairs—an isolated magnetic monopole has never been observed. The existence of magnetic monopoles was first postulated by physicist Paul Dirac in 1931 as a way to explain the quantization of electrical charge seen in nature. Dirac's quantum theory suggested that if monopoles exist, then the observation that electric charge is quantized—a fundamental property of electrons and other particles—would be a natural consequence. According to Dirac, monopoles would act as sources or sinks of magnetic field lines, unlike dipoles, which create a closed loop of magnetic field lines. Despite numerous searches, no magnetic monopoles have been detected to date. Nevertheless, they remain a topic of interest in theoretical physics and high-energy physics experiments. If discovered, magnetic monopoles would have profound implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces in nature, particularly in grand unified theories and superstring theories, where their existence is often predicted. Moreover, the discovery of a monopole would require a major revision of Maxwell's equations, which are the foundation of classical electromagnetism, and it would have a significant impact on the Standard Model of particle physics."},{"instruction":"In short and simple terms...","output":"A monopole is a theoretical single magnetic pole, either a north or a south, which has never been found in nature.

Seagle. A série \\"Ben 10\\" foi lançada pelo canal Cartoon Network e segue as aventuras de Ben Tennyson, que usa um dispositivo alienígena chamado Omnitrix, o qual lhe permite se transformar em diversas espécies alienígenas. A origem do SuperOmnitrix é explicada principalmente na continuação da série original, \\"Ben 10: Alien Force\\" e depois \\"Ben 10: Ultimate Alien\\". Em \\"Ben 10: Alien Force\\", o Omnitrix original é destruído e, posteriormente, em \\"Ben 10: Ultimate Alien\\", Ben ganha o Ultimatrix, que foi criado pelo antagonista Azmuth, o mesmo Galvan (uma espécie alienígena superinteligente) que criou o Omnitrix original. O Ultimatrix concede a Ben não apenas a habilidade de se transformar em várias espécies alienígenas, mas também de evoluir essas espécies para suas formas supremas (ultimate forms), as quais são versões mais fortes e poderosas que possuem habilidades melhoradas em relação às suas formas normais. Azmuth considerou o Ultimatrix como incompleto e inferior ao Omnitrix, principalmente pelo fato de ele ter sido modificado por Albedo, um assistente Galvan renegado. Eventualmente, em \\"Ben 10: Ultimate Alien\\", Azmuth oferece a Ben uma versão atualizada e definitiva do Omnitrix, que substitui o Ultimatrix e não possui a opção de evolução, mas é mais estável e oferece um maior conjunto de funcionalidades. A série \\"Ben 10\\" dá continuidade aos dispositivos como elementos principais da trama, mantendo o conceito de transformações alienígenas e a evolução dos dispositivos em diferentes iterações ao longo de suas sequências e desdobramentos."},{"instruction":"Está errado","output":"Peço desculpas pelo erro.

O SuperOmnitrix, também conhecido como \\"Ultimatrix\\", foi introduzido na série \\"Ben 10: Alien Force\\", mas ganhou destaque principalmente em \\"Ben 10: Ultimate Alien\\". O dispositivo foi criado por Azmuth, o mesmo inventor Galvan do Omnitrix original. No entanto, o Ultimatrix foi roubado pelo seu assistente Galvan, Albedo, que o modificou para seus próprios fins. O Ultimatrix permite a Ben Tennyson não só se transformar em diversas espécies alienígenas, como o Omnitrix original, mas também acessar versões evoluídas dessas espécies, conhecidas como formas supremas (ultimate forms). Essas formas supremas são versões mais poderosas e geralmente mais agressivas dos alienígenas originais.

A narrativa desse evento intricado é crucial para o entendimento da história e das motivações dos personagens. Para explicar como Eren manipulou Grisha, é importante entender o contexto e os poderes envolvidos. **Contexto e Poderes Envolvidos:** Eren possui o poder do Titã Fundador, que lhe concede habilidades únicas, incluindo a capacidade de influenciar outros Titãs e acessar as memórias de portadores anteriores do Titã Fundador. Além disso, quando em contato físico com alguém de sangue real que seja um titã, como Zeke Yeager, seu meio-irmão, Eren consegue usar plenamente os poderes do Titã Fundador. **Manipulação de Grisha Yeager:** 1. **Viagem às Memórias:** - Eren e Zeke visitam as memórias de Grisha, observando eventos passados. Zeke pretende mostrar a Eren que seu pai o manipulou, mas Eren tem outros planos. 2. **Revelação das Intenções de Eren:** - Eren revela que ele tem a capacidade de influenciar essas memórias e, consequentemente, o passado. Ele não é um mero espectador; ele pode interagir com Grisha. 3. **Influência Sobre Grisha:** - Durante a visita às memórias de Grisha na Capela Reiss, onde a família real detentora do poder do Titã Fundador está escondida, Eren usa sua conexão com o pai para instigá-lo a tomar ações que ele inicialmente hesita em fazer. 4. **Momento Crítico:** - Grisha está relutante em massacrar a família Reiss e roubar o poder do Titã Fundador. No entanto, Eren o incita, mostrando-lhe memórias futuras e enfatizando a importância dessas ações para a liberdade dos eldianos e a realização dos objetivos de Eren. 5. **Consequências:** - Influenciado por Eren, Grisha segue adiante com o plano, matando os Reiss e obtendo o poder do Titã Fundador, que mais tarde passará para Eren. **Detalhes Chave:** - **Conexão Temporal:** - A habilidade de Eren de influenciar o passado introduz um elemento de viagem no tempo não linear, onde as ações presentes podem afetar o passado e, por sua vez, o futuro. - **Manipulação Emocional:** - Eren manipula Grisha ao mostrar-lhe memórias de eventos futuros que ainda não ocorreram para Grisha, incluindo a queda das muralhas e o sofrimento que isso causaria. - **Paradoxo Temporal:** - Essa manipulação cria um paradoxo temporal, pois as ações de Eren no presente são o que levam Grisha a agir no passado, resultando na linha do tempo que permite a Eren ter essas memórias e poderes. - **Conflito Interno:** - A manipulação de Eren revela um conflito interno profundo, mostrando que ele está disposto a sacrificar a moralidade e a influenciar seu próprio pai para garantir que seus planos para o futuro se concretizem. Este momento é um ponto de virada na narrativa de \\"Attack on Titan\\", pois redefine a compreensão do poder do Titã Fundador e a natureza do tempo na série, além de revelar a extensão da determinação de Eren em moldar o futuro de acordo com sua visão."},{"instruction":"Ainda não entendi pois: quandoGrusha Yeager Mata A Família Real,Eren Yeager Ainda Era Uma Criança e Não tinha nenhum conhecimento sobre o poder dos Titãs e E nem mesmo estava na capela Reiss então como é possível","output":"A confusão em torno de como Eren Yeager, ainda criança na época em que Grisha Yeager matou a família Reiss, pode manipular seu pai é compreensível, pois envolve conceitos de viagem no tempo e influência intertemporal, que são complexos e podem parecer paradoxais. Vou tentar explicar de maneira mais detalhada: No universo de \\"Attack on Titan\\", o poder do Titã Fundador inclui a capacidade de acessar as memórias de todos os portadores anteriores e futuros. Quando Eren, já adulto e portador do Titã de Ataque e do Titã Fundador, entra em contato com Zeke, que tem sangue real, eles ativam a capacidade do Titã Fundador de acessar essas memórias. Isso permite que eles visitem o passado como observadores, mas com a revelação de que Eren pode influenciar essas memórias e, portanto, o passado. Aqui está o ponto crucial: o Eren adulto, que está revisitando as memórias de seu pai com Zeke, não está fisicamente presente no passado. Em vez disso, ele está exercendo influência sobre Grisha através das memórias que estão sendo acessadas. Esse é um aspecto único dos poderes do Titã Fundador que desafia nossa compreensão convencional de tempo e causalidade. Quando Grisha está na capela Reiss, hesitante em matar a família real, ele é influenciado pelo Eren do futuro, que está projetando suas memórias e vontade através do poder do Titã Fundador. Grisha, que também é um portador do Titã de Ataque naquele momento, é capaz de perceber a presença de Eren e ouvir suas palavras, apesar de Eren ainda ser uma criança na linha do tempo \\"real\\". Essa interação entre passado e futuro é possível devido à natureza do poder do Titã de Ataque, que permite que seus portadores vejam tanto memórias passadas quanto futuras, criando uma conexão atemporal entre eles. Portanto, mesmo que o jovem Eren não estivesse ciente ou presente na capela Reiss, o Eren do futuro, que já tinha conhecimento e acesso aos poderes dos Titãs, foi capaz de influenciar seu pai para garantir que os eventos ocorressem conforme necessário para a conclusão de seu próprio plano. Esse tipo de interação desafia a lógica linear do tempo e introduz um aspecto de predestinação ou determinismo na narrativa, onde os eventos são influenciados por ações futuras que, por sua vez, foram moldadas por esses mesmos eventos passados."},{"instruction":"Explique absolutamente tudo nos mínimos dos mínimos detalhes passo a passo","output":"Para explicar nos mínimos detalhes como Eren Yeager manipulou Grisha Yeager no capítulo 121 do mangá \\"Attack on Titan\\" (Shingeki no Kyojin) e no episódio 79 do anime, precisamos mergulhar profundamente na mecânica dos poderes dos Titãs e na narrativa complexa da série. Vamos por partes: **Contexto da Série:** \\"Attack on Titan\\" é uma série em que humanos vivem em cidades cercadas por enormes muralhas para se protegerem de criaturas gigantescas chamadas Titãs. A história segue Eren Yeager, que tem o poder de se transformar em um Titã e busca vingança contra os Titãs por destruírem sua cidade natal e causarem a morte de sua mãe. **Poderes dos Titãs:** Existem nove Titãs especiais, cada um com habilidades únicas. Eren inicialmente possui o poder do Titã de Ataque e mais tarde adquire o do Titã Fundador. O Titã de Ataque pode ver as memórias de seus portadores passados e futuros, enquanto o Titã Fundador tem a capacidade de controlar outros Titãs e acessar as memórias de todos os eldianos. **O Evento no Capítulo 121 / Episódio 79:** Eren e seu meio-irmão Zeke, que é de sangue real, estão em um espaço atemporal criado pelo contato entre o Titã de Ataque e alguém de sangue real com o Titã Bestial. Eles estão lá para usar o poder do Titã Fundador, mas Eren tem outros planos. **Passo a Passo da Manipulação:** 1. **Conexão Estabelecida:** - Eren e Zeke, ao entrarem em contato, ativam o poder do Titã Fundador. Eles são transportados para um reino de memórias, onde podem observar o passado. 2. **Observação das Memórias:** - Eles visitam várias memórias de Grisha, incluindo momentos-chave de sua vida e ações que levaram ao presente. 3. **Intenção de Zeke:** - Zeke quer provar a Eren que seu pai, Grisha, o manipulou e que a vontade de lutar contra os Titãs foi imposta a ele. 4. **Revelação de Eren:** - Eren revela que ele pode influenciar as memórias e, portanto, as ações de Grisha. Ele não é apenas um espectador passivo. 5. **Influência Direta:** - Na capela Reiss, Grisha hesita em matar a família real e roubar o poder do Titã Fundador. Eren, através das memórias e do poder do Titã de Ataque, fala diretamente com Grisha, mostrando-lhe visões do futuro e convencendo-o da necessidade de suas ações. 6. **Grisha Cede:** - Sob a influência de Eren, Grisha segue adiante e comete o massacre, obtendo o poder do Titã Fundador. 7. **Consequências:** - Grisha mais tarde passa o poder do Titã de Ataque e o Titã Fundador para Eren, completando o ciclo que Eren pretendia garantir. **Detalhes Cruciais:** - **Natureza Atemporal:** - A habilidade de influenciar o passado é uma propriedade única do poder do Titã de Ataque e do Titã Fundador quando combinados, permitindo uma forma de viagem no tempo mental. - **Paradoxo Temporal:** - A manipulação cria um paradoxo onde as ações de Eren no \\"futuro\\" afetam o passado, o que por sua vez leva aos eventos que permitiram a Eren ter esses poderes. - **Predestinação vs Livre Arbítrio:** - A série explora temas de predestinação e livre arbítrio, questionando se os personagens estão seguindo um caminho predeterminado ou fazendo escolhas próprias. - **Efeito das Ações:** - As ações de Eren têm um impacto profundo na narrativa, redefinindo o entendimento dos poderes dos Titãs e o papel que cada personagem desempenha na história. **Conclusão:** A manipulação de Grisha por Eren é um exemplo de como \\"Attack on Titan\\" usa conceitos de viagem no tempo e influência intertemporal para desenvolver sua trama e personagens. A capacidade de Eren de afetar o passado enquanto está no presente é um aspecto fundamental que molda o curso da história e destaca o poder e a determinação de Eren em alcançar seus objetivos."},{"instruction":"Use uma linguagem simplificada","output":"Claro, vamos simplificar a explicação de como Eren Yeager manipulou Grisha Yeager em \\"Attack on Titan\\": 1. **Poderes Especiais:** Eren tem um poder que lhe permite se transformar em um Titã e também acessar memórias de pessoas que tiveram esse poder antes dele. 2. **Viagem nas Memórias:** Eren e seu meio-irmão Zeke, que tem sangue real, usam esse poder para olhar para o passado como se estivessem assistindo a um filme das memórias de seu pai, Grisha. 3. **Eren Revela um Segredo:** Eren mostra a Zeke que ele pode fazer mais do que apenas assistir; ele pode falar com Grisha através dessas memórias. 4. **Momento Importante:** Eles veem o momento em que Grisha, que também podia se transformar em um Titã, hesita em matar outras pessoas para pegar um poder especial de Titã que eles têm. 5. **Eren Convence Grisha:** Eren, mesmo não estando realmente lá, consegue convencer Grisha a fazer o que precisa ser feito. Ele faz isso mostrando a Grisha coisas que ainda vão acontecer e explicando por que é importante seguir em frente com o plano. 6. **Grisha Faz o Que Eren Diz:** Influenciado pelo que Eren lhe mostrou, Grisha decide agir, mata as pessoas e pega o poder especial. 7. **Ciclo Completo:** Mais tarde, Grisha dá esses poderes de Titã para Eren, que é ainda criança naquela época. Isso significa que Eren, quando adulto, garantiu que ele mesmo recebesse os poderes quando criança. **Resumindo:** Eren usou um poder especial para \\"falar\\" com seu pai em memórias do passado e convencê-lo a fazer algo muito importante, mesmo que isso fosse difícil. Isso ajudou a garantir que Eren tivesse os poderes de Titã que ele precisava no futuro."},{"instruction":"Seja mais detalhado e utilize ilustrações diferentes para explicar","output":"Vamos tentar uma abordagem mais detalhada e ilustrativa para explicar como Eren manipulou Grisha, usando metáforas para simplificar os conceitos complexos de \\"Attack on Titan\\": **Imagine que o Poder dos Titãs é como um Livro de Histórias Gigante:** 1. **O Livro de Histórias (Poder dos Titãs):** - Pense no poder dos Titãs como um livro de histórias gigante onde cada portador do poder é uma página. Eren pode ler todas as páginas, até mesmo as que ainda não foram escritas. 2. **A Sala de Cinema (Viagem nas Memórias):** - Eren e Zeke entram em uma sala de cinema especial onde podem assistir aos filmes das memórias de Grisha. Normalmente, as pessoas só podem assistir, mas Eren descobre que ele pode interagir com o filme. 3. **O Controle Remoto (Influência de Eren):** - Eren tem um controle remoto que lhe permite falar com o personagem principal do filme, seu pai Grisha. Ele pode pausar, rebobinar e até sussurrar sugestões para Grisha. 4. **O Momento Decisivo (Capela Reiss):** - No filme, Grisha está em um momento decisivo. Ele precisa pegar um tesouro escondido (o poder do Titã Fundador) que está guardado por uma família (os Reiss). Mas ele está com medo de fazer o que é necessário para pegá-lo. 5. **Sussurros do Futuro (Eren Convence Grisha):** - Eren usa o controle remoto para sussurrar para Grisha. Ele mostra cenas do futuro que só ele pode ver, convencendo Grisha de que ele precisa pegar o tesouro para salvar o futuro. 6. **Ação (Grisha Segue o Plano):** - Influenciado pelos sussurros de Eren, Grisha toma coragem, enfrenta a família guardiã e pega o tesouro. 7. **Passando o Bastão (Grisha Dá os Poderes a Eren):** - Depois, Grisha passa o tesouro (os poderes dos Titãs) para Eren, que ainda é um menino. Isso garante que Eren terá o poder no futuro para fazer tudo de novo. **Ilustrações Diferentes:** - **O Controle Remoto:** Representa a habilidade de Eren de influenciar as ações de Grisha. Eren pode \\"pressionar os botões\\" para alterar o que Grisha decide fazer. - **O Tesouro Escondido:** Simboliza o poder do Titã Fundador que Grisha precisa obter. É valioso e protegido, e Grisha tem que superar obstáculos para pegá-lo. - **A Sala de Cinema Especial:** É uma metáfora para o espaço atemporal onde Eren e Zeke observam as memórias. Eles estão dentro da sala, mas também podem afetar o que está acontecendo na tela. **Conclusão Simplificada:** Eren, como um espectador que pode interagir com um filme, influencia Grisha, o personagem principal, para agir de uma certa maneira e garantir que o \\"roteiro\\" do futuro aconteça como Eren acredita que deve acontecer."},{"instruction":"Mas como isso é possível e quais perguntas está situação levanta","output":"A possibilidade de Eren manipular Grisha através das memórias é um elemento de ficção científica e fantasia dentro do universo de \\"Attack on Titan\\". A série introduz conceitos como a herança de memórias e a influência atemporal como parte dos poderes dos Titãs, especialmente o Titã de Ataque e o Titã Fundador. Vamos entender como isso é possível dentro da lógica da série e as perguntas que essa situação levanta: **Como é Possível:** 1. **Poderes do Titã de Ataque:** O Titã de Ataque tem a habilidade única de acessar as memórias de seus portadores passados e futuros. Isso significa que Eren pode ver o que aconteceu e o que vai acontecer. 2. **Poderes do Titã Fundador:** O Titã Fundador pode manipular memórias e controlar outros Titãs. Quando Eren, que possui o Titã de Ataque, entra em contato com Zeke, que tem sangue real, eles ativam o poder total do Titã Fundador. 3. **Espaço Atemporal:** Eren e Zeke entram em um espaço onde o tempo não funciona como estamos acostumados. Aqui, eles podem revisitar eventos passados como se estivessem acontecendo naquele momento. 4. **Influência Direta:** Dentro desse espaço atemporal, Eren consegue interagir com Grisha, apesar de estarem em tempos diferentes. Ele pode mostrar a Grisha visões do futuro e convencê-lo a agir de uma maneira específica. **Perguntas que a Situação Levanta:** 1. **Predestinação vs. Livre Arbítrio:** Se Eren pode influenciar o passado, isso significa que tudo está predestinado? Os personagens têm livre arbítrio ou estão apenas seguindo um roteiro já escrito? 2. **Paradoxos Temporais:** Como a influência de Eren sobre o passado afeta a linha do tempo?

Aqui estão 15 curiosidades que talvez não sejam amplamente conhecidas: 1. **Inspiração para os Titãs:** Hajime Isayama, o criador do mangá, se inspirou para criar os Titãs após encontrar um cliente bêbado em um café onde trabalhava. A dificuldade de se comunicar com ele fez Isayama pensar em seres humanos que são impossíveis de se comunicar, como os Titãs. 2. **Nome do Protagonista:** O nome \\"Eren\\" vem do nome de um amigo de infância do autor, enquanto \\"Yeager\\" é derivado da palavra alemã \\"Jäger\\", que significa \\"caçador\\". 3. **Mikasa e a História Japonesa:** Mikasa Ackerman recebeu o nome do navio de guerra japonês \\"Mikasa\\", que por sua vez foi nomeado após a Montanha Mikasa em Nara, Japão. 4. **Design dos Titãs:** Alguns dos Titãs são baseados em amigos e conhecidos de Isayama, e outros são inspirados em atletas e lutadores de MMA. 5. **Cameos de Titãs:** Em alguns capítulos do mangá, Isayama desenhou Titãs que se parecem com personagens de outras séries de mangá/anime como uma forma de homenagem. 6. **Estrutura Social:** A sociedade dentro das muralhas reflete o sistema de castas da Índia, com os ricos vivendo no centro e os pobres nas áreas mais próximas das muralhas. 7. **A Língua dos Eldianos:** A escrita eldiana no mangá é na verdade o alfabeto alemão estilizado e invertido. 8. **O Número Nove:** Há nove Titãs especiais em \\"Attack on Titan\\", e o número nove aparece várias vezes na mitologia e simbolismo ao redor do mundo, o que pode ter influenciado a escolha de Isayama. 9. **Referências Históricas:** A série contém várias referências à história do mundo real, incluindo eventos e figuras da Segunda Guerra Mundial. 10. **O Fim Originalmente Planejado:** Isayama tinha um final diferente em mente para a série, que seria mais sombrio e poderia ter terminado com a morte de todos os personagens principais, mas ele decidiu mudar o curso da história após o sucesso do anime. 11. **Influência de \\"Muv-Luv\\":** Isayama citou a visual novel \\"Muv-Luv Alternative\\" como uma grande influência para \\"Attack on Titan\\", especialmente no que diz respeito ao desespero dos personagens e à sensação de estar preso. 12. **A Cidade Natal de Isayama:** A cidade natal de Isayama, Hita, em Oita, Japão, tem várias referências a \\"Attack on Titan\\", incluindo estátuas e decorações temáticas. 13. **O Titã de Ataque e o Tempo:** A habilidade do Titã de Ataque de ver memórias passadas e futuras foi inspirada pela teoria do tempo de Kurt Vonnegut em \\"Matadouro-Cinco\\". 14. **A Bebida Favorita de Levi:** A bebida favorita de Levi é o chá preto, uma informação que foi revelada em um dos guias oficiais da série. 15. **O Primeiro Esboço de Isayama:** O primeiro esboço de Isayama para \\"Attack on Titan\\" foi rejeitado por várias editoras antes de ser aceito pela Kodansha e se tornar a série que conhecemos hoje.

Isayama ficou fascinado pela ideia de medo instintivo e a dificuldade de comunicação com algo que parece humano, mas não é. 2. **Eren Yeager:** O nome \\"Eren\\" foi inspirado por um amigo de infância de Isayama, que ele descreveu como alguém que sempre dizia o que pensava, sem se preocupar com o que os outros pensariam, uma característica que ele emprestou ao protagonista da série. 3. **Mikasa Ackerman:** O nome \\"Mikasa\\" vem do navio de guerra pré-Dreadnought japonês, que por sua vez foi nomeado em homenagem ao Monte Mikasa em Nara, Japão. O navio Mikasa desempenhou um papel importante na Guerra Russo-Japonesa, e Isayama escolheu o nome para simbolizar a força. 4. **Design dos Titãs:** Isayama frequentemente usa pessoas reais como referência para os Titãs, incluindo amigos e conhecidos. Por exemplo, o Titã Sorridente que matou a mãe de Eren foi baseado em um funcionário de uma loja de conveniência local. 5. **Cameos de Titãs:** Em algumas cenas, Isayama desenhou Titãs que se parecem com personagens de outras séries populares, como \\"One Piece\\" e \\"Dragon Ball\\", como uma forma de homenagem e brincadeira com os fãs. 6. **Estrutura Social:** A sociedade dentro das muralhas é uma representação do sistema de castas, com os ricos vivendo no centro seguro e os pobres e desfavorecidos morando nas áreas mais perigosas perto das muralhas externas. 7. **Escrita Eldiana:** A escrita eldiana no mangá é na verdade o alfabeto alemão estilizado e invertido, o que reflete a inspiração de Isayama na cultura e história alemãs. 8. **O Número Nove:** O número nove é significativo em muitas culturas e religiões. Isayama pode ter escolhido nove Titãs especiais para refletir essa importância simbólica. 9. **Referências Históricas:** \\"Attack on Titan\\" contém várias referências e alegorias à história do mundo real, particularmente à Segunda Guerra Mundial, com paralelos entre os Eldianos e grupos oprimidos da história. 10. **O Fim Originalmente Planejado:** Isayama inicialmente planejou um final trágico para a série, onde todos os personagens morreriam, similar ao final do filme \\"O Nevoeiro\\" de Stephen King. No entanto, ele decidiu mudar para um final menos sombrio após o sucesso do anime e o apego dos fãs aos personagens. 11. **Influência de \\"Muv-Luv\\":** Isayama mencionou que a visual novel \\"Muv-Luv Alternative\\" teve uma grande influência em seu trabalho, particularmente na representação do desespero e na sensação de estar preso em uma situação sem esperança. 12. **Homenagens em Hita:** A cidade natal de Isayama, Hita, celebra o sucesso de \\"Attack on Titan\\" com várias estátuas e decorações temáticas, incluindo uma estátua de Eren em sua forma de Titã. 13. **Teoria do Tempo de Vonnegut:** A habilidade do Titã de Ataque de ver memórias passadas e futuras foi inspirada pela representação não linear do tempo no romance \\"Matadouro-Cinco\\" de Kurt Vonnegut, onde o protagonista se desloca entre diferentes momentos de sua vida. 14. **Levi e o Chá Preto:** Levi Ackerman, um dos personagens mais populares, tem uma preferência por chá preto, uma característica que reflete sua personalidade refinada e seu gosto por simplicidade e ordem. 15. **Rejeição e Sucesso:** O primeiro esboço de \\"Attack on Titan\\" foi rejeitado por várias editoras antes de ser aceito pela Kodansha.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones, and it goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. In the context of trading, the sequence is not the key factor, but rather the mathematical relationships, expressed as ratios, between the numbers in the series. In trading, Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. They are drawn by taking high and low points on a chart and marking the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and sometimes 76.4% horizontally to produce a grid. These ratios are found by dividing certain numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and have mathematical properties that are manifested in natural and man-made systems. To apply Fibonacci retracements to a trading chart: 1. Identify a significant price movement, typically by locating a strong trend or a clear movement from a low point to a high point (or vice versa). These are your anchor points. 2. Use a Fibonacci retracement tool available on most trading platforms. Place the first point at the swing low and the second point at the swing high for uptrends, or the first point at the swing high and the second point at the swing low for downtrends. 3. Once applied, the tool will generate the key percentage levels, which will serve as potential reversal levels where the price might find support or resistance. For example: - After a stock has experienced a significant uptrend, it might retrace. This means that it will have a momentary price decrease before it continues on its upward trajectory. - The Fibonacci retracement tool could indicate that the price is likely to bounce back from one of those key Fibonacci levels which act as support levels. Traders then use these levels as indicators to position their trades around these lines, relying on historically observed behavior that price has a tendency to retrace a predictable portion of a move, before continuing in the original direction. In the context of a trading strategy, Fibonacci retracements can help traders to assess risk/reward, set orders like stop-loss or take-profit targets, or identify the potential scope of a correction or a countertrend bounce. While commonly used, it should be noted that Fibonacci retracement is a subjective tool. Different traders might select different high and low points to place their retracement lines, and as with all technical indicators, it should be used in conjunction with other indicators and methods to confirm trading signals."},{"instruction":"what is the best way to retire with a life expected of living only to 72 years taking the retirement at 62 and invest with a 5% return or to wait till the age of 65 years old","output":"Deciding when to retire and how to invest your retirement savings is a complex and deeply personal decision that depends on numerous factors, including your health, life expectancy, lifestyle, risk tolerance, current savings, expected future expenses, and sources of income. Here, we'll discuss some general considerations that can help you in making this decision. **Life Expectancy and Early Retirement:** If you are expecting to live to the age of 72 and are considering retiring at 62, you would need to plan for approximately 10 years of retirement. Retiring at 65 would reduce this to 7 years. The decision to retire earlier or later can have significant implications for your retirement savings. **Retiring at 62:** - You would have more years of retirement to enjoy, but it would also mean that you need to finance a longer period without a regular employment income. - By retiring three years earlier, you would need to start withdrawing from your retirement savings sooner, giving your investments less time to compound. - Additionally, if you’re eligible for social security benefits or pensions, taking them before full retirement age can significantly reduce the amount you receive. - You would need to make sure your retirement savings are sufficient to cover your earlier start and potentially longer retirement period. **Retiring at 65:** - Waiting until age 65 could allow your savings to grow more due to additional contributions and compound interest. - You might receive larger payouts from social security or pensions due to delaying benefits. - Though you would have fewer retirement years, your annual income from retirement savings could be higher due to shorter distribution phase. **Investing with a 5% Return:** - A 5% annual return is a relatively conservative estimate and could be realistic with a balanced portfolio. - The return will still need to counter inflation, which will erode the purchasing power of your money over time. - The longer your retirement savings remain invested without withdrawals, the more significant the impact of compound interest. **Financial Considerations:** 1. Calculate your estimated annual expenses during retirement, taking into consideration potential healthcare costs, housing, food, and other living expenses. 2. Determine all your possible sources of income during retirement, including social security, pensions, annuities, or other investments. 3. Estimate the total amount of savings you will have by retiring at 62 versus 65, considering ongoing contributions and investment growth. 4. Assess the impact of withdrawing from your savings starting at 62 versus waiting until 65. **Health and Personal Considerations:** - If your health or personal reasons lead you to believe you will live to 72, early retirement might be preferred to ensure you maximize your leisure time. - Consider your pursuits and activities post-retirement – will you have enough to engage in the activities you enjoy? **Other Considerations:** - Consider the potential for unexpected expenses or changes in life expectancy. Planning solely around the expected lifespan can be risky. - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance. Ultimately, the \\"best way\\" is very individualized. Ideally, you would create a detailed financial model of both scenarios and explore the implications of each to make an informed decision. Consider prioritizing not only your financial security but also the quality and enjoyment of your retirement years."},{"instruction":"Reveiew and create a trading plan with the following information : House of Traders - Trading Guide by MrLorenzo Platforms to trade on Free -WeBull -TD Ameritrade (Think or Swim) Paid -Lightspeed (You will see how volatile stocks actually are.

Let’s take a look of this in action: if you need to print out the chart so you know what's going on. 1 Minute Chart 5 Minute Chart Notice the difference? The 1 minute charts are everywhere, while the 5 minute chart will tell you the whole story. EVERYTHING IN TRADING IS ABOUT BREAKOUTS AND FALSE BREAKOUTS. EVERYTHING IN TRADING IS ALSO ABOUT TRENDLINES. Your whole goal is to draw a trendline from the high of day, to a period of consolidation. THE PERIOD WE ARE ANALYZING IS THE TRADE FROM 7 TO 8.3 See how I have a line of resistance at 7.20 Check the graph, it touched 7.20 multiple times throughout the day and consistently failed to break it. It constantly kept going to 7.25, 7.3, 7.4 and falling back down. However, notice from 8:45 to 10:20 it constantly stayed between 6.75 and 7.2. This is what we call consolidation. Now notice in my graph I drew a trendline. When drawing a trendline, the strongest trendline starts from the high of the day. Then you connect it to all the pops.In this case the strongest pop up was 7.68. As soon as we break the trendline, this is where you want to enter. ONLY after periods of consolidation. This breakout came at 7.05. However let’s review a couple other trendlines you could have drawn: The arrows provide entry points on the break of trendlines. Although these are ok to enter, it’s still very risky. 1st trendline: This trendline connects from the high of day to its lowest pullback. This is still a good entry because the stock has massive volume and just pulled back almost 1.5. 2nd trendline: This trendline connects from the high of day to everywhere it is rejected. Essentially you could keep shorting this as long as it stays below the trendline. Once it breaks you want to close your short. 3rd trendline: This trendline connects from the high of day to everywhere else it is rejected. The difference here is we have consolidation. Consolidation means people are getting in and out of this stock. However, this stock had gone from 4 to 8 and it is still holding 6.75. Someone is keeping this price up and they are not done with it yet. When you see a stock up this much and it’s holding a certain support level, that’s very bullish. Usually when stocks are up 100%, if they are weak, it will dump right away. It won’t hold that line for hours. Now I added another trendline from the move at 9:50. Notice how the trendline is acting as support/resistance You could do these things: 1. Enter at 7.25 on that big breakout candle at 10:35, but remember, this is us just talking about it. You wouldn’t know that's coming. Or would you? Remember, in trading, that was a period of a 1 hour consolidation, we didn’t drop too much, we didn’t go up too much, we stayed within a 6.75 to 7.2 range. This is called a range. We are trading within a 45 cent range, that allows us to minimize our risk. Why 7.25? Because we are finally getting above 7.2 resistance. *Also remember multiple times on the chart we saw 7.2 go to 7.3, 7.4, 7.45 and flush down. So when entering at 7.25 you can quickly update your stop to 7.25. You want to see volume come in. In this case it did. This is a PROPER breakout. This will happen in a matter of seconds or minutes. You want to see volume come in immediately. Why? The trendline is broken and 7.2 resistance is broken as well. 2. The reason I first started by drawing the first trendline, is it showed me where the resistance points were from the high of the day. Then, when I drew the 2nd trendline, I also noticed more resistance at those levels. But, during all this we saw a period of consolidation. This is the move I'm focusing on: I would enter right here as soon as I saw a big green candle. Why? Because check the price, we are also now breaking 7. Every dollar point is known as huge resistance and huge support. I would have likely entered 7 and put a stop loss of 6.7. Remember, we only traded in solidation from 6.75 to 7.25, that leaves me a .30 cent risk. However, once it failed 7.2 resistance AGAIN. It’s actually a good thing. I can see it’s fighting to break out again and again, and if it’s really strong, it will hold. REMEMBER this had news, so I’m expecting it to go higher because it hit 8.3 during the open. This is the move I’m talking about: . 3. Now, if we look closer, you would notice there is actually another trendline. Throughout that day, you can see multiple times it failed to break this trendline. So remember, we have our strongest trendline, the trendline from the high of day and this trendline. BUT, if we analyze this closely, you would have realized, when we entered at 7 (break of trendline), the price does not go below that trendline. Notice as well, there is a trendline you could draw that shows 6.86 as support. If you were really advanced and saw this coming, you could have caught the dip at 6.86. And again, updated your stop to 6.7 as the consolidation period is 6.75 to 7.2. Now you would ask, how would you see this coming? Good question. 1. We just saw a consolidation period for an hour and then we tried to break out. We failed at that 7.2 region. However, we are still not below 6.7. This stock isn’t done yet until it falls under 6.7. Also notice, that trendline was previous resistance. Now it is acting as support. At this point, you would have caught the dip at 6.86 or entered at 7, both with 6.7 stop losses. Now, you would see a strong green bullish candle till the 7.2 resistance. However, look at the candle, this is a strong move with not much of a pullback AND holding 7 support. Remember again, those ’s are good supports/resistances. You would have caught the trade from either 6.86 in the example above, to 7 in the break of trendline, to 7.25 to the break of trendline + resistance, all the way to 7.86. Do you sell? NO! Again, remember the stock had news. Here is a very important thing in trading. Remember how I said we trade mainly from 9am to 12pm EST? Many other traders do just the same. However, if the stock holds steady and isn’t falling past 12PM, it is STRONG! Let’s now analyze where you take profits You already know 8.3 was the high of day, with a bullish move after 12pm est, you are expecting it to retouch those levels when we breakout like that. You actually expect buyers to come in when we break 8.3 as well. Once in a trade, you want to find the next trendline of support. Notice from the pullback of 8.3 to the low of that pullback, that trendline is acting as support from the breakout. As long as that trendline holds, you are good to be in that stock. Notice when drawing trendlines, you may add here to your position at 7.82 at 10:50am PST. If you did, you're looking for the break of 8. With a stop loss of 7.5. Why? Because just like ’s are supports and resistances .50 cents are supports and resistances as well. Now if it fails that level, we just did another false breakout. This isn’t the most ideal spot to add into as you are not near support and resistance lines (6.75 to 7.2) that were built through consolidation for over 1 hour. Remember, we added 7 in large sizing because there was support/resistance built at 6.75 to 7.2 for a full hour. This move just happened in 10-20 minutes. When you add 7.82, you are hoping for a 8 break, if the break doesn’t happen, 8 is now a resistance and sell. But, as soon as the price jumps to 8.05, instantly update your stop loss at 8. Why? Because remember 8.3 is the resistance of the high of the day. Why am I analyzing this trade so much? Because just like my trading strategy, others will have a strategy to add 8.31. The break of high of day. Why don’t I do this? It’s too risky, there is no consolidation. Can you do this? Yes, you can, but again, less sizing. We added heavy sizing because of news + consolidation + our risk was low. Now, your trade would have been stopped out at 8. You would have made profit at 7 to 8 move. We had a stop of 6.7, and our best low was 6.86. You risked 30 cents to make 1. If this was super strong, we would have built support around 8, held 8, and you would have seen this rise to 9, 10, 11 etc. You make your profit on those massive winners and you make your bread and butter to live on these trades. NOW, you may ask, well , why stop trading it now? What happens if it consolidates AGAIN. Well first, that massive red candle isn’t a good sign after we are about to break high of the day, it also broke that trendline downwards. But, you never know, the trade could go again. Now, let’s look at the new setup. Notice how this isn’t a clean break. 7.3 to 7.62 was the breakout according to the trendline. Consolidation was there from 12:55 to 1:20. Again, pretty strong if a stock consolidates from 7.17 to 7.43 So the trendline shows another breakout. Your entry is 7.3 to 7.38. Around that region. As well as over 7.43, the break of the resistance. However, AS SOON as you make that trade, immediately update your stop to 7.43. The level we shouldn’t fall under. That was previous resistance, it shall now act as support. Remember how 7.2 was resistance. Now that level should turn into support? Once those levels failed, see how we fell from 7.2 to 6.6. You can trade these and add during support. But why! Why not wait for the trendline and buy right before a breakout? You want to identify breakouts and add during periods of consolidation, so your risk is low. Also remember, we didn’t consolidate didn’t the period of the breakout from the high of the day. We just fell. You stopped out at 8. You made 1 14%. Why keep trading it when it fails to consolidate. You already made 14% risking 5%. Now, if you get good at this, imagine having 5 14% winners and 2-3 5% losers! Now, let’s say it did consolidate, and hit 9, 10, etc. 10 is always looked at as a strong resistance by the way. You would have massive winners of 20-25% gains! YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THE TRADER CHASING 100% winners. Here is how you get a 100% winner. Market opens, we have news. Notice how every candle is green? Notice all the red arrows, notice the bars. See how at 6.25 we pulled back to 6. Then notice how at 6.8 we pulled back a little to 6.75. Notice again how at 7.5 we pulled back to 7.48. Throughout this full time, we barely pulled back. There is no reason to sell. However watch this Finally, we finally pulled back to the candle at 7.5. It’s time to abandon the stock. Rewatch to see later if we get consolidation or this is just a falling knife that tanks back to 5. And we did watch it, that’s how we got out big winner from 7 to 8. Now again, that’s not our most amazing trade. But if it consolidated and held 8, we would have had a massive winner because it would have broken 8.3, and 8.3 would have been our new stop loss. Check the best part, once it broke 6.7. Game over. For example check this chart out at KODK, look exactly where it pulled back. Trendlines can literally tell you exactly when to get out. Trends Everything we do in trading relates back to trends. For example, over the last few weeks, we saw a massive trends in: 1. Electric Vehicle Stocks 2. Marijuana Stocks 3. SPAC’s When this happens, there is something called sympathy plays. For example, this works in day trading as well. Go check out 2 stocks: 1. Eyes 2. Ears See there big spike ups? It’s known as a sympathy play. When you see 1 small real estate stock run, you can then go in expect 1 of the other small real estate companies to run. It’s also very important to understand, for a sympathy play to truly be profitable, it must be a premarket gapper that runs 100%++. Here is how you do this: Go to Finviz.com and type in real estate: However, you are not looking for large cap stocks. You are looking for smaller cap stocks that can be pumped. For example, check out the charts in the chinese companies XIN and HGSH. XIN was the first one to run. Then, guess what wall street did? They picked HGSH to run next. This allows you to get an entry point close to support and hope that they pump a sympathy play next. In this case, XIN and HGSH were traded over multiple days. But in the case for a day trade, you need to be fast and search it up when a stock is up 100%++. Finviz can also be looked at for more analysis on a company. For example, look at stock DPW. Now analyze the times. You will see each time if you go back into TOS, this stock was quickly bought and quickly dumped. This is clearly a pump and dump run by the management. Constantly they are pumping their EV charging line, releasing news like it’s a brand new news article and they have a new concept. Another thing to watch for is when they do offerings. Let’s say you're in a position, you want to see if there is a pattern of constant offerings? Offerings are basically diluting all the shareholders and the company raises capital for themselves. They get free money and screw every shareholder. Now, you're able to go back to a stock, and see when the offering was done. For example, let’s assume you're in a multi day runner penny stock. If you see the previous patterns, you may see when the stock price rises, they will constantly release PR. Let’s take a stock like IDEX. All of June, they released PR articles every single day. Remember, a company needs to maintain 1 stock price to be listed on Nasdaq. They will get multiple notifications from the SEC that they need to maintain the stock price or do a reverse split. A reverse split is highly damaging, an already struggling stock reverses it’s shares from let’s say 1 to 10. That way a 50 cent stock becomes 5. But, when the company is already a shitty company like most of the stocks we trade, it will then fall even more because it is a shitty company. But what happens to the company? Constantly they are having smaller market cap rates. The value of the company becomes less and less. What does this mean? It means when they do an offering, to raise millions of dollars and screw shareholders over, they cannot do it for a high price. Meaning they won't benefit as much and make more dollars. We want to identify these companies who care about market cap and who will release PR after PR to keep the stock price high. If IDEX ever falls under 1 and stays there and let’s say is at 0.50 cents a year from now. Then, they release a PR article of good stuff. You may want to buy in massive shares. You know they are at 0.50 and want to maintain 1 so they will constantly give out good press. Remember, in stocks, everything is a scam. Wall street is working with companies to make millions of dollars, companies are raising millions of dollars and keeping it for their “business,” and you are just trying to get your piece by identifying the scam and the trend. For example, let’s look at ReMark Holdings, ticker MARK. Don’t you think he wants his 11 million in stock options? If their share price falls closer to under 1, remember, he is sitting there ready to tell you he solved the solution to cancer and we can all fly to mars. Notice how MARK is spiking up lately? A trade you may take is CREX. Both MARK + CREX are in the thermal camera space. We can load CREX close to 1 support, if and only if, MARK has a day it runs 10%+. Using VWAP/EMA In the chart setup, I had you set up something called VWAP/EMA. Vwap is the volume weighted average price. EMA is the exponential moving average. My VWAP is at the green line and my EMA is at the blue line. When the stock price is above the VWAP and the EMA is close to it AND the trend line is very close as well, it allows us to have bigger share sizing. You would enter at the break of a trendline with a stop underneath VWAP OR EMA. Depending on your risk tolerance. Throughout the day you will constantly see stocks bounce off VWAP as well. In the case above, you would enter at the breakout of 4.2 with a stop right under EMA at 4. Once again, another .20 cent risk and this hit a high of 5.4. Almost a 25% return on your money for another 5% risk. VWAP EMA BREAKOUT IN ACTION Lets look at a perfect example of VWAP/EMA in action Here is KODK on 12/11. We had news on KODK. Remember, I’m reviewing this chart later. The VWAP/EMA are moving throughout the day. But in this case, it provides me a perfect example. First off, let’s get one thing clear. If the stock is under the vwap/ema, it’s looked at by most people as weak. However, once it reclaims vwap and gets above it, it’s looked at as strong. Why? Because people use VWAP/EMA as their stop loss point. Let’s do some analysis. (BEFORE READING THE POINTS BELOW TRY TO FIND THEM ON YOUR OWN) 1. We are breaking the trendline. 2. We are reclaiming vwap. 3. We can use the EMA as a stop loss. 4. We have support resistance lines at 11, 12, 13, and 14. In each of them, we trade in a range. See here we always get stuck in a range. 5. At the break of the trendline we had consolidation. Now if you noticed! We didn’t run during market hours! We ran after hours. Why is this important? When a stock hits all the scanners, in our case we are looking at finviz top gainers, many people are looking for the next stock to run. You can usually keep all stocks on watch and if it’s still running after hours you can hop in for a play. 6. Let’s draw our upwards trendline to see where we need to stop out at. Entry is break of trendline, 12.34 Stop is at ema, 11.96. Risk is 3.2% Exit is here: 13.14 to 13.4 Gain is 6.4% to 8%. (Again this is just an example, but some stocks run more) 7. What did we learn before? As long as that green candle is closing above where the previous 5 minute candle closed at, we are still bullish. 8. Break of trendline downwards = stop. This was at 13.4, but let’s say you didn’t catch it, then stop at 13.14 at the latest. Let’s review the chart further: 1. Was there a break of trendline? Yes. 2. Was there consolidation? No. 3. Should you enter? No. Big red candles should scare you. Notice how the market just opened and there are millions of shares being dumped. Who is getting out? You should be questioning it. Maybe a wall street firm knew the news was coming? Noticer how trendlines work on the daily as well sometimes. Day Trading Ranges Check out this beautiful chart on HGSH. Notice how if you draw support/resistance, everytime it tries to treat resistance as support once it breaks above it. Also, you can see it trades within that range and rejects at the top. If you identify this pattern, you're able to constantly trade within that 40 cent range multiple times throughout the day. You can easily scalp 5-8% out of this multiple times throughout the day. As you can see first from 3.3 to 3.75, sell, again back to 3.3, back to 3.75, then sell, buy again 3.3, NOW notice how it breaks out at 3.75. You would actually sell 3.75 again, and ADD over 3.8. As you identified the range is .40 cents. It doesn’t matter if the stock went over 4.2. You would sell at 4.2, then re add again at 4.3, sell again 4.7. There were so many attempts you could have traded this in 1 single day for over 5-8% multiple times. It would have also allowed you to have stop losses underneath support. As we discussed previously, once it breaks the consolidation period, you're no longer interested in trading the stock. As you can see this traded in a downwards consolidation, excellent for shorting. Checking the daily to see how much room we have to run One thing every trader must do is check out how much room we have to run. When you see a stock on the scanner, you can see the daily chart of the stock. For example EVK has already ran to 7 before. Now if it’s holding above that 7 region, it’s very strong. But, let’s say EVK has some amazing news and you catch it in the 3-5 range, you know this has room up to 7. Another example, DPW. Valuations Large Caps This year was a crazy market. Companies were literally being offered for pennies on the dollar. One of the big ones we got into was SPG, Simon Property Group. The most simple way I could teach someone valuations is something called PE Ratio. PE Ratio is the best way to value companies. For example, the PE ratio of SPG had traded for years at a 20X PE ratio. That means if they made 1M a year, their company would be worth 20M. However, this year we were able to buy SPG at a 8-10X PE ratio. SPG was a tenant that owned malls and outlets around the United States and Worldwide. However, while everyone was too busy focused on malls ending, we realized, many of their centers were outlet centers. These outlet centers aren’t even being closed down as they are not in enclosed spaces. We got in at 60 and currently it’s about 90. The point I’m making here is, regardless of everything being shut down, they had so much cash on their balance sheet, they could survive years without going through bankruptcy. At the end of the day their retail centers are still worth money. When coronavirus is over, all their retailers will be paying top dollar once again. I make all these points to show you some of the ridiculous valuations. I’m sure you hear it all the time, or you may be one of these people, “should I buy tesla now?” “should I buy Amazon now” “Should I buy Apple now” This all goes back to market caps and PE ratios. Apple Market CAP - 2T. PE Ratio - 37 Tesla Market Cap 578B PE Ratio - 1208 Amazon Market Cap - 1.5T PE ratio - 91 Walmart Market Cap - 400B PE ratio - 21 NIO Market cap - 60B PE ratio - doesn’t make money no ratio. Now, let’s look back at a Tesla chart. For the longest time in the world, Tesla used to trade as a 60B company. Take a look at Nikola. At some point this year, Nikola was a 60B company. Now, remember, NIO is currently 60B. Please tell me, how can Nikola be worth 60B and NIO be worth 60B when Tesla almost went through bankruptcy back in 2016, ran a whole solar business, had the whole world know Elon Musk and his electric cars, and be one of the first to market EV cars in this mass scale. Now, tell me, the people buying Tesla at a 600B valuation, what do you expect? How much more upside is there when Apple sells phones to all of the world and Amazon literally has 1 day deliveries all over the world. Yet, Tesla isn’t selling cars all over the world. YES, if one day Tesla is delivering cars all over the world, we may see 2-3 times the stock price. However, that’s years and years away. What are people doing buying it now? As well as NIO/Nikola, there are years and years away for this product to even get to the level Tesla did in 2016. Another thing, DoorDash just went public at a 60B valuation. Postmates was sold to uber eats for 2B. What did they do to deserve a 60B valuation? Are they profitable? No. Is there revenue tens of billions? No. So don’t chase doordash. These businesses are being traded of hype and thoughts of the future. WHAT IS GOING TO RUN? Everyday we see about 10-20 tickers up 10-50%+. The question is how do we find that stock that will run 100%+. 1. In the market there are people who short stocks. These guys close their short closer to resistance/support lines. However, just like buying stocks, there are inexperienced shorters, who don’t want to take a loss. These guys will get stopped out with their broker. GLSI was amazing. It ran from 5 to 158. It consolidated in the 20-40 region and then just went crazy. Everytime it went up. There was 0 reason to exit. It kept just getting halted up. Why? 1. Shorts were getting squeezed out. 2. Momentum buyers were buying in at new highs to keep making money off it halting up. 3. Sometimes algo’s are created to buy as soon as a stock hits a new high or a stock is going to be halted. Keeping all this in mind, everything comes down to the news article. They claimed there was 0% recurrence of breast cancer. This is a stock if it’s up 20-30-40% you know it’s going to run more. During the summer time, IDEX literally posted a picture of Tesla cars during its PR. GEVO even claimed they were going to do 1 billion in sales and we got the stock from .8 when it was at .5. It ended up running to 3. The crazier the headline, the more it runs. I don’t like playing headlines about earnings results. I don’t like playing headlines about something they have mentioned on finviz before. (Check DPW constantly releasing PR’s about their charging solution) I do like when a company that has never entered the EV market, enters the EV market. ONLY if EV is trending like it is now. Let’s check back at the end of the week. I’ll compare some of the headlines of the stocks that ran and the stocks that didn’t. So we all see real time what’s going on. THE STOCK MARKET IS ABOUT TRENDS. YOUR JOB IS TO CATCH ON TO THE TREND EITHER BEFORE IT HAPPENS OR WHILE IT'S HAPPENING. Not after everything like EV stocks are up to insane valuations.","output":"Based on the comprehensive information provided from the \\"House of Traders - Trading Guide by MrLorenzo,\\" your trading plan could be outlined as follows: **1. Selecting a Trading Platform:** - For charting and trading, use a free platform like TD Ameritrade (Think or Swim) for its advanced tools and after-hours trading capabilities starting at 7am EST. - Consider WeBull as an alternative for earlier premarket trading starting at 4am EST. **2. Trade Type Focus: Breakout Trading** - Focus on breakout trading during the prime time of 9am EST to 12pm EST, identifying premarket gappers with potential for breakout. - Use https://finviz.com/ to track top premarket gappers and gauge market interest. **3. Account Size Consideration:** - If under Pattern Day Trader (PDT) limits (25,000), be highly selective with trades to avoid hitting the day-trading limit and to maximize returns on fewer, higher-quality trades. **4. Chart Setups:** - Utilize VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and a 20-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) for technical analysis on Think or Swim. - Set up Volume indicators to visualize trading activity. - As a main strategy, use the 5-minute chart for a clearer trend view, but also prepare to use 1-minute charts for more detailed entry and exit points. **5. Identifying and Trading Breakouts:** - Trade based on consolidation periods and the breakout of major resistance levels, often marked by whole or half dollar amounts (7, 7.50, etc.). - Draw trendlines from high of day to points of consolidation for potential breakout points. - Enter trades only after periods of consolidation and upon a confirmed breakout signal—such as a large bullish candle and increased volume. - Set stop losses conservatively based on trendlines and the end of consolidation ranges. **6. Post Trade Review and Profit-Taking Strategy:** - Review the strength of the stock post-breakout, especially around key resistance levels and after 12pm EST—if the stock holds or continues climbing, it may indicate strength. - Set profit targets based on previous high points or psychological resistance levels, and adjust stop losses appropriately to protect profits as the trade progresses. **7. Additional Strategies:** - Sympathy Plays: Monitor related stocks for potential trades based on the movement of similar companies or sector trends. - VWAP/EMA Crossover: Identify buying opportunities when the stock price is above both VWAP and EMA and approaching a trendline. **8. Risk Management:** - Always be prepared with a predetermined risk level and stop-loss for every trade. - Do not chase excessively speculative or high-flying stocks without clear, justified entries and risk controls. **9. Ongoing Education:** - Continuously learn from past trades through detailed post-analysis to refine your strategies and recognize patterns. **10. Market Research and Analysis:** - Stay updated with market trends and review the news thoroughly for trading ideas and to understand broader market movements. - Look into company valuations and financial health when considering longer-term trades or investments. **11. Documentation:** - Keep a trading journal detailing each trade, the rationale, the outcome, and lessons learned to ensure constant improvement and accountability. By adhering to this structured plan based on the guidance provided, you would establish a disciplined approach to trading that includes rigorous technical analysis, risk management, and ongoing self-assessment. Always remember to adapt and refine your plan based on market conditions and personal performance."},{"instruction":"Convert this to pinescript for tradingview platform : import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi import yfinance as yf import time tickers = [item for item in input(\\"Enter tickers: \\").split()] spend_amount = int(input('Spend amount per investment: ')) balance = int(input('Balance: ')) tickers_count_long = {} long_price = {} long_return = {} returns = [] loss_count = 0 win_count = 0 numbers_longs = 0 stop_loss = {} first_tp = float(input('First tp (dec): ')) second_tp = float(input('Second tp: ')) third_tp = float(input('Third tp: ')) end_hour = float(input('At what hour do you want to liquidate all positions n(Enter 15 to end right before market close.

If a person chooses to use marijuana, certain individuals believe that smoking weed with a bong may offer certain advantages: 1. Smoother inhaling experience: Smoking marijuana through a bong can potentially result in a cooler and smoother smoke inhalation compared to other methods. The water within the bong helps filter out contaminants and cools down the smoke, thus reducing the harshness of the inhalation. 2. Increased potency: Some individuals believe that smoking weed with a bong allows for a more efficient and potent delivery of THC (the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana). The water filtration is thought to remove some impurities and potentially enhance the concentration of THC. 3. Larger hits: Bongs often have larger bowls and chambers, allowing users to take bigger hits of marijuana compared to other methods. This may potentially result in a more intense and immediate effect. 4. Water filtration: The water in a bong is intended to filter out some potentially harmful compounds, such as ash, tar, and other particles, which may be inhaled when smoking marijuana through other means. While this does not entirely remove all potential risks associated with smoking, some believe it may reduce the overall exposure to certain harmful substances. 5. Cooling effect: The water within the bong cools down the smoke, making it less hot and potentially providing a more soothing experience for the throat and lungs. It's essential to note that marijuana affects individuals differently, and the potential benefits and risks associated with smoking it can vary from person to person.

Due to the painful and hateful history behind the word, it has become taboo in most forms of public discourse. It is widely considered disrespectful and hurtful to use, and it is almost universally condemned when used by someone who is not a member of the African American community. Even within the community, its usage is contentious and subject to a wide variety of opinions and social norms. Due to its offensive nature, I won't spell out the word, but it's important to understand the impact of such words and why they are hurtful. It's a term that should be approached with understanding of its historical context and current implications.

It was ruled by a nobleman with the title of Landgrave (German: Landgraf). The term is derived from the German words \\"Land,\\" meaning \\"land,\\" and \\"Grave,\\" an older German title for a count (similar to an earl in British nobility) that became obsolete in English but continued in German as \\"Graf.\\" This rank was unique to some German-speaking regions and implies a higher status than a count, thus giving the Landgrave more autonomy and greater feudal powers within their respective territories. The landgraviate was usually larger than a county (German: Grafschaft) and could consist of several counties within it. As the Holy Roman Empire was a complex agglomeration of semi-independent states, the power and prestige of a Landgrave could vary significantly. Examples of Landgraviates include Hesse, Thuringia, and parts of Alsace. Over time, as the political landscape of Europe evolved, many of these entities were incorporated into larger political units or became obsolete as noble titles and their associated lands were secularized or mediatized (absorbed into a larger state)."},{"instruction":"Why was there so much non-contiguous territory in the Holy Roman Empire? For example, the Electorate of Bavaria controlled small pockets of territory beyond the Bavarian region.","output":"The non-contiguous territories in the Holy Roman Empire were the result of a complex history of feudalism, dynastic marriages, inheritances, wars, and politics that shaped the European landscape over the centuries. Several factors contributed to this patchwork of holdings: 1. **Dynastic Marriages and Inheritances**: Noble families would often secure marriages with other noble families to cement alliances, gain power, or acquire new territories. The children from these marriages could inherit lands from both sides of the family, leading to a collection of non-contiguous territories under a single ruler. 2. **Feudal Fragmentation**: The feudal system in place during the Middle Ages encouraged the subdivision of land among noble heirs. When a nobleman died, his lands might be divided among all of his sons rather than just going to the eldest (partible inheritance). This practice could create scattered territories as different branches of a family came to control different regions. 3. **Purchase or Pawn**: Territories could be bought and sold between noble families. Also, land could be temporarily transferred (pawned) to settle debts or as a way to raise money. These financial transactions did not always respect geographic coherence. 4. **Imperial Politics**: The Holy Roman Emperor had the power to bestow fiefs and titles, which could result in non-contiguous territories. The emperor might also redraw boundaries for political reasons, such as rewarding loyal vassals or punishing rebellious ones. 5. **Warring Successions**: The many small states within the Empire often led to conflicts over succession rights. Wars and treaties could then redistribute lands in ways that didn't create contiguous territories. 6. **Ecclesiastical Territories**: The Holy Roman Empire included numerous bishoprics, archbishoprics, abbacies, and other ecclesiastical states. These were often spread out and non-contiguous, as they were established based on the locations of religious centers rather than territorial cohesion. 7. **Legalistic Complexity**: The Empire had a sophisticated and somewhat convoluted legal system that allowed for various forms of landholding and jurisdiction. This complexity could sometimes result in peculiar territorial arrangements. As a result of these and other factors, the map of the Holy Roman Empire was a constantly shifting mosaic of territories that seldom corresponded to modern ideas of a nation-state with contiguous borders. The Electorate of Bavaria and many other states within the Empire were thus composed of scattered lands, creating a political and administrative challenge that lasted until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in the early 19th century and the subsequent reorganization of German territories."},{"instruction":"In short and simple terms...","output":"In short, the non-contiguous territories of the Holy Roman Empire were the result of a mix of historical marriages, inheritances, feudal divisions, political deals, wars, and the complex legal structures of the time. These factors often led to rulers controlling disjoined patches of land rather than unified regions."},{"instruction":"What are some examples of non-contiguous polities beside the United States of America and the Holy Roman Empire?","output":"Several countries throughout history and in the modern world have non-contiguous territories, often due to historical conquests, colonialism, or specific political arrangements. Here are a few examples: 1. **France**: France has several overseas departments and regions such as Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Réunion, and Mayotte. These areas are integral parts of France but are located far from the European mainland. 2. **Russia**: The Kaliningrad Oblast is an exclave of Russia that is situated between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, separated from the main part of Russia. 3. **United Kingdom**: The UK consists of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, with the latter being non-contiguous with the rest of the country. The UK also has several overseas territories like Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, and Bermuda. 4. **Netherlands**: The Kingdom of the Netherlands includes the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curacao, and Sint Maarten as constituent countries, alongside the European part of the Netherlands. 5. **India**: The northeastern states of India are connected to the rest of the country by a narrow corridor of land known as the Siliguri Corridor or \\"Chicken's Neck,\\" with the rest of the region largely surrounded by Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, and Myanmar. 6. **Indonesia**: Indonesia is an archipelagic state with more than 17,000 islands, making many of its regions separated by sea. 7. **Italy**: The Italian region of Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave within Switzerland, and the Republic of San Marino is an independent enclave surrounded by Italy. 8. **Azerbaijan**: Has an exclave, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is separated from the main part of Azerbaijan by Armenia. 9. **United States**: In addition to the mainland, the U.S. includes the non-contiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii, and territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam. These examples show that the phenomenon of non-contiguous territories can be found in various forms around the globe, often influenced by unique historical circumstances and geographic factors."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I guess we have a good mix here.\\" Yuri: \\"Indeed, I look forward to discussing the characteristics and appeal of each genre in detail.\\" Natsuki: \\"As long as it doesn't get too technical, count me in.\\" Sayori: \\"This is going to be so much fun! I can't wait to hear what everyone has to say.\\" (Monika starts jotting down the main points discussed, ensuring everyone gets a chance to contribute.) Monika: \\"Alright, let's begin. We'll start with romance. Sayori, would you like to share your thoughts?\\" Sayori: \\"Sure! I think romance novels are great because they make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. They give you hope that true love really does exist.\\" Natsuki: \\"Ugh, they're so cheesy and unrealistic. I prefer a good mystery any day. The thrill of trying to solve the puzzle keeps me hooked.\\" (Yuri nods in agreement.) Yuri: \\"Mystery novels have a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat. The suspense and intrigue that comes with uncovering clues and secrets is truly captivating.\\" Monika: \\"And fantasy offers a chance to escape reality and delve into magical worlds of adventure and limitless possibilities. It allows us to believe in extraordinary beings and extraordinary feats.\\" (After a lively discussion, they move on to comedy.) Natsuki: \\"Finally, something I can fully get behind. Comedy is all about laughter and enjoying the lighter side of life. I love a book that can make me laugh out loud.\\" Sayori: \\"Comedy books are like a breath of fresh air. They can instantly boost your mood and bring a smile to your face, even on the gloomiest days.\\" Monika: \\"So, it seems we can find enjoyment in different genres, each offering something unique. Isn't it fascinating how literature can touch us in various ways?\\" Yuri: \\"Absolutely. It's that diversity that makes the literature club such a great place for us to explore and expand our horizons.\\" (Monika smiles, proud of the club's vibrant discussion and the diverse perspectives shared.) Monika: \\"Well, I'd say it was a successful meeting. I hope we all gained a deeper appreciation for various literary genres.

It helps me appreciate the literature on a whole new level.” Sayori: “Yeah, Yuri has a way with words. She always manages to uncover some hidden meanings that I never even noticed.” Natsuki: (rolling her eyes) “Right, because analyzing every single sentence is so riveting.” Monika: “Well, Natsuki, there is more to literature than just analyzing sentences. It can help us explore different perspectives, empathize with characters, and even reflect on our own lives.” Sayori: “Exactly! It’s like stepping into someone else’s shoes and seeing the world through their eyes.” Natsuki: “Yeah, yeah, I get it. But can’t we also have some activities that are more interactive? Like playing games or something?” Monika: “That’s a great idea, Natsuki! We can incorporate interactive activities into our meetings, like book-themed trivia games or even acting out scenes from the books we read.” Yuri: “I think that's a wonderful compromise. We can still have our discussions, but also engage in some hands-on activities.” Sayori: “I love that! It'll be a good balance of learning and fun.” Natsuki: (looking slightly more interested) “Alright, I guess that could work. As long as it’s not all talk and no play.” Monika: “Of course, Natsuki. I want everyone to enjoy their time in the literature club.” (As the meeting begins, the club members indulge in both intellectual discussions and creative activities, finding a balance that caters to everyone’s interests.

I’m excited to hear all of your thoughts and interpretations of the book. Remember, everyone’s opinions are important and valid.” Yuri: “Absolutely.

As long as we don’t give up on reading altogether, I suppose.” Monika: “Of course not. Reading will always be at the core of our club. But it’s important to keep things fresh and engaging for everyone.” Yuri: “I agree. Variety can spark new ideas and perspectives that enhance our understanding of literature.” Sayori: “Yay! I’m excited to see what new ideas we can come up with. This club is the best.” Natsuki: (smiling) “Yeah, I guess it’s not so bad after all.

I’ve noticed a recurring motif of the color red throughout the story. It seems to represent passion and intense emotions.” Monika: “That’s a great observation, Yuri. The author’s use of color to convey deeper meaning is definitely something worth exploring.” Sayori: “I agree. I think the color red also symbolizes danger and warning in some instances. It adds a sense of tension to the narrative.” Natsuki: “Hmm, I never really paid attention to the colors. I was too focused on the actual story.” Monika: “That’s okay, Natsuki. There’s no right or wrong way to interpret literature. It’s all about personal connections and what resonates with you.” Natsuki: “Yeah, well, I still think discussing cupcakes would be more fun.” Sayori: “Well, we can always talk about literature while enjoying some cupcakes. That way, we get the best of both worlds!” Natsuki: (grudgingly) “I guess that could work…” Monika: “Excellent!

Adduction occurs when a player brings the arm towards the center of their body, for example, when making a throw-in or attempting to shield the ball from an opponent. On the other hand, abduction happens when the arm is moved away from the body, such as when a player is jumping to head the ball or extending their arm to reach for a high pass. The knee joint in soccer is responsible for several important movements. Flexion occurs when a player bends their knee, like during a kicking motion or when performing a tackle. Extension, on the other hand, occurs when the knee joint is straightened, for example, during a jump or when a player is running. The knee joint also allows for a small amount of rotation, which can be useful when a player wants to change direction quickly or in certain defensive movements. The ankle joint in soccer is crucial for various movements, especially for the feet. Dorsiflexion happens when the top of the foot is moved towards the leg, as seen in actions like kicking the ball or when a player is pulling their foot up to avoid a tackle. Plantar flexion, on the other hand, occurs when the foot is pointed downward, aiding in actions such as making a powerful shot or when a player is trying to accelerate quickly. The ankle joint also allows for inversion (rolling the foot inward) and eversion (rolling the foot outward), which are essential for changes in direction, especially when dribbling or performing quick turns on the field."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, anyone excited for today’s club meeting?” Yuri: “I certainly am.

Hey everyone! I'm a 21 year old boy who thinks he has not done anything in life. I'm short 5'3-5'4 and this is biggest of the factor of my low confidence.People have told me that I look good and have a great personality but only if I was taller, things would have been different. I'm very less social. I find it hard to talk with new people. And I think it wasn't like this before 2021. In my highschool Igot asked out by a girl (she was taller than me) and at start I was a bit hesitant and didn't like that girl much but later only I got attached and it was really hard to spend my time without talking to her. But after a year when my school got over and she got into a college and I took a drop. She just decided not to be with me anyone And I was broken. It was not sudden she had multiple times said that she want to get over with it. Even though I was sad and depressed i just let her go but after some times she would come back and apologize and the same thing would happen. Atlast I got fed, i deleted every social media so that I would have no option to talk to her. And wrote a mail saying goodbye and ending things. After this I was depressed, used to cry a lot. I stopped seeing and talking to my friends.I started thinking negatively and down talked about myself. I felt every decision i made was wrong and every time she came back i shouldn't have talked to her. And from this point everything fell like domino. I lost my mother in COVID. I really loved her. She and papa were the only thing that made me happy. And after she left everything changed. I was in a rock bottom. it was really hard to wake up every morning and realise that my ma isn't with me anymore. Thinking about her still makes me cry till now. In all this, i couldn't study much and didn't got decent percentile to get a good college. But few of my friends that I was still taking to were going to some xyz college. So I decided to join too. And things were like just going on. I'm in my 6th semester now in a 4 year course. Didn't develop any skills. Only after my 5th semester I made some friends who encouraged me to start coding. And I did start but I'm not consistent. I do get phone calls from that girl and I do recieve them. The main reason of writing this post is this only. Yesterday I got a call from her she told me about how she got place as SDE at a handsome package. She had already told me about the relationships she got into after me( when she first told me it was just 2-3 months after I wrote that mail) and is now in a relationship whom she plans to settle down with it. We talked about many things and our schedule and all it made me feel useless. Like she has got placed and is in her last sem. She also got an internship from Microsoft earlier. And yeah she used to work and study a lot, so I think iit was natural. But I'm not just comparing with her but all my other friends got placed too in good companies. They made new friends and here Im stuck don't know where to go what to do. I just waste time doing nothing and I also became porn and masturbation addict like I used to do it multiple times in a day. I have been trying to get rid of this bad habit but hasn't not successful. The only thing I could I had spend time on is running. That's the only thing that makes me escape from this world. After I complete my 5k or sometimes 10k it makes feel so happy that I couldn't describe but yeah consistency is also problem here I like being praised and acknowledged.(everyone does). And just want that I whatever I do, I must be good at it. I could earn enough to fulfill my family's needs. I don’t have any special hobbies or interests. I don’t care about branded clothes even though dressing well is another thing, bikes, or cars. Also I don't have much interestest in traveling. Sometimes I do like solving Rubik’s cubes, like 3x3 or 4x4, so I sometimes ge","output":"Hello everyone, I'm a 21-year-old man struggling with self-confidence, partly due to my height of around 5'3\\" to 5'4\\", which consistently weighs on my mind. Despite receiving compliments about my looks and personality, I can't help but think things might have been different if only I were taller. I'm not very social and find it increasingly difficult to initiate conversations with new people—a change I've noticed since before 2021. Back in high school, a girl who was taller than me asked me out. Initially hesitant and not very interested, I eventually grew quite attached to her. So much so, that her absence made my days challenging. Our relationship ended a year later when she went to college, and I chose to take a year off. She expressed several times a desire to move on, and eventually, I had to let her go. In an attempt to heal, I cut off contact, deleted my social media, and sent a goodbye email. Following the breakup, I experienced depression and began to isolate myself from friends. I fell into a pattern of negative self-talk and regret over reconnecting with her each time she returned. My life felt like a series of cascading events; my mother's passing during the COVID pandemic hit me particularly hard. She was a source of immense joy for me and my father, and waking up to the reality of her absence was devastating. In terms of education, my studies suffered and my exam percentile was not high enough for a top college. Some friends were attending a particular college, so I joined them, feeling directionless. Now in my sixth semester of a four-year course, I realize I haven't developed any meaningful skills. It wasn't until my fifth semester that I made new friends who encouraged me to start coding. I've begun, but struggle with consistency. The ex-girlfriend still calls, and I can't help but answer. Yesterday, she shared her recent achievements: a job as a Software Development Engineer with a great salary and her last semester in college. She'd previously informed me of her new relationship, and they have plans to settle down. Her success leaves me feeling inadequate, especially when I look at my peers who are also excelling professionally and socially. Meanwhile, I feel stuck, unsure of my path, wasting time, and battling a porn and masturbation addiction, which I'm earnestly trying to overcome. One of the few activities I've found solace in is running. Whether I complete a 5k or sometimes a 10k, it's one of the rare moments when I feel truly joyful, though I struggle here too with consistency. I crave praise and acknowledgment, a common human desire, and hope to excel in whatever I pursue, ideally to provide comfortably for my family. While I don't have many hobbies or interests, sometimes I enjoy solving Rubik’s cubes like the 3x3 or 4x4. Material possessions like designer clothes, bikes, or cars don't captivate me, and traveling isn't a significant interest either. I long for a sense of direction and to find fulfillment in my endeavors. I wanted to share my story because I know this community can offer valuable perspectives and advice. How do you find purpose and maintain motivation, especially when you feel like you're lagging behind your peers?

Building such a generator typically requires expertise in machine learning, particularly in generative adversarial networks (GANs) or similar architectures like VQ-VAEs enhanced with transformer models, like DALL-E by OpenAI. While I cannot create an image generator tool within this platform, I can outline the basic steps you might take to build one on your own if you're familiar with machine learning and programming: 1. **Choose a Model Architecture**: Depending on the desired quality and style of images, choose an appropriate model. GANs are a common choice, but recent advancements like OpenAI's DALL-E or Google's Imagen use transformer-based models for more coherent outputs. 2. **Gather a Dataset**: Obtaining a comprehensive dataset is crucial. This dataset must be large, diverse, and well-labeled to train the model effectively. You may need to use dataset augmentation techniques to expand your data. 3. **Preprocess the Data**: Clean and preprocess the dataset. This typically involves normalizing the images, possibly resizing them to a uniform dimension, and encoding text prompts in a way the model can understand, often using techniques like tokenization. 4. **Design the Generator Network**: Craft the generator portion of your GAN or other generative models, which will create the images from noise vectors or encoded text inputs. For text-to-image models, this often involves a cross-modality architecture where text embedding influences the image generation process. 5. **Design the Discriminator Network** (if using GANs): The discriminator compares generated images to real ones and provides feedback to the generator on its performance. 6. **Train the Model**: Use your dataset to train the model. This involves feeding the network input data (in this case, text prompts), generating images, and then using the discriminator to improve the generator through adversarial training. 7. **Fine-tune and Evaluate**: Adjust hyperparameters and training techniques to improve the output. Evaluation can be subjective but should involve examining image quality, diversity, and relevance to the input prompts. 8. **Create an Interface for the Generator**: For usability, create an application or interface that allows users to input text prompts and view the generated images. 9. **Post-processing**: Sometimes the generated images can be further improved with post-processing techniques to enhance quality or adjust styles. 10. **Deploy the Model**: Finally, make the generator available to users through a web service, application, or API. Please note that training generative models is resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power, and is best done using specialized hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. Moreover, ethical considerations, including the responsible use of AI and the handling of biased data, must be taken into account. If you're not technically inclined to build an image generator from scratch, you might consider using existing platforms like OpenAI's DALL-E API or similar services that offer access to pre-trained models. These can generate images from text prompts directly, without the need for your own machine learning infrastructure."},{"instruction":"Create image generator for good prompt:","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I lack the capability to generate actual images directly within this text-based interface; however, I can provide you with guidance on how to create an image generator for text prompts using existing technology: 1. **Understand Image Generation Models**: Familiarize yourself with state-of-the-art image generation models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and newer transformer-based models like OpenAI's DALL-E, which is specifically designed for generating images from text prompts. 2. **Select a Pretrained Model or Framework**: Instead of building a model from scratch, you can use a pre-trained model or framework. For instance, DALL-E, which can generate images from text prompts, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities. 3. **Set Up Your Environment**: You'll need an appropriate software environment with necessary libraries and dependencies. Typically this involves Python, along with machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. 4. **Obtain API Access (Optional)**: If you choose a cloud-based model like OpenAI's API, you'll need to sign up for access and obtain API keys. This can greatly simplify the generation process, as you won't need to train a model yourself. 5. **Develop a Small Application**: Create a basic application that can send prompts to your chosen model or API service and display the results. This can be a simple script or a more elaborate web application, depending on your programming skills and requirements. 6. **Integrate the Model or API**: Write code that feeds text prompts into the model or sends them via API calls to the service, then receives and displays the generated image. \`\`\`python # Example Python script using a hypothetical image generation API import requests from PIL import Image from io import BytesIO # Function to call the API and generate an image def generate_image(prompt): api_key = 'YOUR-API-KEY' endpoint = 'https://api.imaginary-service.com/generate' response = requests.post( endpoint, json={'prompt': prompt}, headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'} ) return Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)) # Use the function with your prompt my_prompt = 'A futuristic cityscape at sunset' generated_image = generate_image(my_prompt) # Display the image generated_image.show() # Save the image if desired generated_image.save('generated_image.png') \`\`\` Please replace 'YOUR-API-KEY' and the endpoint URL with actual values provided by a legitimate image generation API service. Remember, this is a highly simplified example. In a real-world use case, you should handle error checking, retries, and potentially a user interface for inputting prompts and displaying images. 7. **Test and Iterate**: Test your application with different prompts to evaluate the image quality and relevance. Based on feedback, you may need to adjust your approach, potentially considering different models or fine-tuning parameters for better results. Access to image generation models often requires adherence to the service provider's guidelines, and you should ensure that your use case complies with their policies, as well as broader ethical considerations when generating images. Creating an image generator application is greatly simplified by using existing APIs and frameworks, making the technology accessible even to those who may not have specialized machine learning expertise."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, anyone excited for today’s club meeting?” Yuri: “I certainly am.

However, \\"Bolt\\" is not a recognized asteroid in standard astrological practice; instead, it seems to be a hypothetical or fictional asteroid for the sake of this interpretation. With that in mind, let's explore how an asteroid named \\"Bolt\\" conjunct the Sun might be interpreted symbolically within a natal chart. First, we should consider what the asteroid's name might symbolize. A bolt could be seen as a sudden surge of energy, a flash of insight, or a symbol of fast movement or change. It might also carry connotations of a \\"bolt from the blue,\\" an unexpected and potentially transformative event. In mythology, bolts are often associated with thunder gods like Zeus or Thor, representing powerful forces and sometimes messages from the divine. Next, it's important to understand the conjunction aspect and the role of the Sun in astrology. A conjunction occurs when two celestial bodies are in close proximity to each other in the zodiac. This aspect tends to blend the energies of the planets or points involved, sometimes creating a fusion of their significations. The Sun in astrology represents one's core identity, ego, life force, and conscious purpose. It is the center of the personal solar system, symbolizing how an individual shines and expresses their unique self in the world. The Sun also relates to career, health, and vitality. Combining these elements, here's a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the hypothetical asteroid \\"Bolt\\" conjunct the Sun in the natal chart: 1. **Energetic Presence**: The conjunction of Bolt with the Sun could indicate a person who is seen as lively and dynamic. This individual may possess an infectious energy that lights up a room, much like a sudden flash of lightning. 2. **Drive for Change**: The name \\"Bolt\\" suggests swift, decisive action. Therefore, someone with this conjunction in their natal chart may be prone to initiating changes in their life abruptly but with a strong sense of purpose. They might not be afraid to take risks or make bold moves. 3. **Insightful and Perceptive**: With the Bolt's energy linked to the Sun, this person may have an exceptional ability to have sudden insights or epiphanies that lead to self-discovery or alter their life path. They might be seen as intuitive or even prophetic in some manner. 4. **Powerful Aura**: Reflecting the divine bolts of gods like Zeus, this individual may carry a powerful aura or presence that commands attention and respect. They may be seen as a natural authority figure or someone with a firm grip on their destiny. 5. **Confrontational Nature**: Just as a bolt can strike suddenly, people with this aspect may have a temper or a direct manner of confronting issues. They might not shy away from conflict, and their strong will can be both an asset and a challenge. 6. **Innovator or Trailblazer**: The energy of Bolt conjunct the Sun could suggest that this person is a pioneer in some aspect of their life, pushing boundaries and perhaps involved in cutting-edge work or thought. 7. **Unexpected Turns in Life**: A bolt represents the unexpected, and individuals with this aspect might experience life as a series of surprising turns. Their path may be marked by sudden events that forge their character and shape their destiny. 8. **Healing or Destructive**: Depending on other factors in the chart, the power of Bolt may be used constructively or destructively. The individual might possess the ability to ‘zap’ problems and clear the air or, conversely, might accidentally burn bridges if not careful. 9. **Catalyst for Others**: As a person who carries the energy of a bolt, they might serve as a catalyst for change in others’ lives, inspiring or provoking growth through their actions and mere presence. Keep in mind that, unlike major celestial bodies, asteroids often add more nuanced or secondary themes to a chart and should be interpreted in the context of the whole chart, considering sign placement, house location, and aspects to other planets. Since “Bolt” is not a standard part of astrological interpretation, this exploration serves as a creative exercise in deriving meaning from symbolic names and potential celestial influences."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, anyone excited for today’s club meeting?” Yuri: “I certainly am.

Here are reasons why these variables are commonly chosen for sensitivity analysis: 1. **Peak Flow (Maximum Flow Rate)**: - **Critical for flood risk assessment**: The peak flow determines the maximum water level that can occur during storm events, which is crucial for designing flood defenses, culverts, bridges, and other hydraulic structures. Understanding how sensitive the peak flow is to various input variables can help in mitigating flood risks and in making informed decisions regarding land use and structural measures. - **Indicator of system response**: It indicates how the system (watershed, stream, or river) responds to intense rainfall or snowmelt events, which is valuable for early warning systems and emergency preparedness. 2. **Time to Peak (Time of Concentration)**: - **Understanding watershed response times**: This indicates the time it takes for water to travel from the most distant point of the watershed to the outlet. This is valuable for predicting the timing of flood waves, which has implications for alerting downstream populations and implementing flow control measures. - **Calibration and validation**: It is a key parameter in hydrological models, often used to calibrate and validate the temporal accuracy of model simulations. Sensitivity analysis can highlight how model performance can be affected by changes in factors like rainfall intensity, land cover, or soil characteristics. 3. **Discharge Volume (Total Volume of Runoff)**: - **Water resource management**: The total volume of runoff from a storm event is important for water supply planning, reservoir management, and assessing the total volume of contaminants that might be transported from the watershed. - **Environmental impact assessments**: Understanding the sensitivity of discharge volume to various inputs can help in assessing the impact of land-use changes, climate variability, or other human activities on the water balance of a catchment. - **Infrastructure design**: For designing storage and flood control measures, it is important to know the total volume that needs to be managed. In sensitivity analysis, you investigate how different input parameters (such as rainfall intensity, soil properties, land cover, etc.) affect these outputs. This can help in identifying the most influential parameters that control the behavior of your hydrological model or system, informing where to prioritize data collection or which model parameters require more accurate estimation. Moreover, sensitivity analysis can help in assessing the robustness and reliability of model predictions under different scenarios, which is fundamental for planning and decision-making processes."},{"instruction":"better explain WHY i would pick those. if you can summarize it","output":"Certainly, here's a succinct explanation for why you would select peak flow, time to peak, and discharge volume as outputs for sensitivity analysis: 1. **Peak Flow**: To identify how different input variables affect the risk of flooding and to ensure infrastructure is designed to accommodate extreme flow conditions. 2. **Time to Peak**: To understand the watershed's reaction time to precipitation events, which is crucial for flood forecasting and emergency response planning. 3. **Discharge Volume**: To assess the total impact of runoff on water resources, including supply availability and potential for pollutant transport, and to inform storage and flood mitigation strategies. Choosing these outputs helps prioritize which factors most significantly impact flood risks, response times, and resource management, which is essential for efficient planning and mitigation efforts."},{"instruction":"remove the context of risk assessment and planning","output":"If you remove the context of risk assessment and planning, you would pick peak flow, time to peak, and discharge volume as outputs for sensitivity analysis for the following succinct reasons: 1. **Peak Flow**: To gauge how sensitive the hydrological system is to maximum flow conditions, which can influence ecosystem behavior and hydraulic structure operation. 2. **Time to Peak**: To evaluate the response time of the system to varying inputs, affecting how quickly peak conditions are reached following a precipitation event. 3. **Discharge Volume**: To determine the sensitivity of the total water output to input variations, which can impact overall system storage and flow dynamics. These outputs allow you to understand the fundamental response characteristics of a hydrological system to input changes, irrespective of application to risk or planning scenarios."},{"instruction":"reword the discharge volume explanation. make it simpler","output":"3. **Discharge Volume**: To understand how changes in inputs could alter the total amount of water flowing from a system, which affects how the system handles water storage and distribution."},{"instruction":"what is initial content and saturated content of a sub basin. give simple straight foward definitions","output":"**Initial Content**: It is the amount of water already present in a sub-basin before any rainfall or additional water input; essentially, the starting level of moisture or water content. **Saturated Content**: This refers to the maximum amount of water a sub-basin can hold.

I hope you all like them.” Natsuki: “Ugh, why do we always have to talk about books?

Though, I’m sure we can find a way to make it enjoyable for everyone.” Natsuki: “Fine, but I’m not promising anything.” (caressing her belly) “Not to mention that, in 2 more months, I’m about to have my own little bookworm running around.” Monika: “Congratulations, Natsuki! That’s wonderful news. I’m sure your little one will grow up surrounded by plenty of books.” Yuri: “Indeed, reading from a young age can have countless benefits for a child’s development. It helps improve vocabulary, stimulates imagination, and instills a lifelong love for learning.” Sayori: “And it can also be a great way for parents to bond with their children. Reading together can create precious memories and foster a strong emotional connection. But first, I think I might need to use the bathroom.” Monika: “Of course, Sayori. Take your time.” Natsuki: “I never really thought about it that way. Maybe reading can be fun after all, especially when it’s with my little one. I’ll have to find some children’s books to start reading to them.” Monika: “That’s a great idea, Natsuki. I’m sure your child will love hearing your voice reading to them.

( عاملة ناصبة ) فيه وجوه أحدها : إن المعنى عاملة في النار ، ناصبة فيها ، عن الحسن وقتادة قالا : لم يعمل لله سبحانه في الدنيا ، فأعلمها وأنصبها في النار بمعالجة السلاسل والأغلال . قال الضحاك : يكلفون ارتقاء جبل من حديد في النار . وقال الكلبي : يجرون على وجوههم في النار وثانيها : إن المراد عاملة في الدنيا بالمعاصي ، ناصبة في النار يوم القيامة ، عن عكرمة والسدي . وثالثها : عاملة ناصبة في الدنيا ، يعملون وينصبون ويتعبون ، على خلاف ما أمرهم الله تعالى به ، وهم الرهبان وأصحاب الصوامع ، وأهل البدع والآراء الباطلة ، لا يقبل الله أعمالهم في البدعة والضلالة ، وتصير هباء لا يثابون عليها ، عن سعيد بن جبير ، وزيد بن أسلم ، وأبي الضحاك ، عن ابن عباس . وقال أبو عبد الله عليه السلام : كل ناصب لنا ، وإن تعبد واجتهد يصير إلى هذه الآية ( عاملة ناصبة ) . أما قوله تعالى : { وجوه يومئذ خاشعة عاملة ناصبة } فاعلم أنه وصف لأهل الشقاوة ، وفيه مسألتان : المسألة الأولى : المراد بالوجوه أصحاب الوجوه وهم الكفار ، بدليل أنه تعالى وصف الوجوه بأنها خاشعة عاملة ناصبة ، وذلك من صفات المكلف ، لكن الخشوع يظهر في الوجه فعلقه بالوجه لذلك ، وهو كقوله : { وجوه يومئذ ناضرة } وقوله : { خاشعة } أي ذليلة قد عراهم الخزي والهوان ، كما قال : { ولو ترى إذ المجرمون ناكسوا رؤوسهم } وقال : { وتراهم يعرضون عليها خاشعين من الذل ينظرون من طرف خفي } وإنما يظهر الذل في الوجه ، لأنه ضد الكبر الذي محله الرأس والدماغ . وأما العاملة فهي التي تعمل الأعمال ، ومعنى النصب الدؤوب في العمل مع التعب . المسألة الثانية : الوجوه الممكنة في هذه الصفات الثلاثة لا تزيد على ثلاثة ، لأنه إما أن يقال : هذه الصفات بأسرها حاصلة في الآخرة ، أو هي بأسرها حاصلة في الدنيا ، أو بعضها في الآخرة وبعضها في الدنيا ( أما الوجه الأول ) : وهو أنها بأسرها حاصلة في الآخرة فهو أن الكفار يكونون يوم القيامة خاشعين أي ذليلين ، وذلك لأنها في الدنيا تكبرت عن عبادة الله ، وعاملين لأنها تعمل في النار عملا تتعب فيه وهو جرها السلاسل والأغلال الثقيلة ، على ما قال : { في سلسلة ذرعها سبعون ذراعا } وخوضها في النار كما تخوض الإبل في الوحل بحيث ترتقي عنه تارة وتغوص فيه أخرى والتقحم في حر جهنم والوقوف عراة حفاة جياعا عطاشا في العرصات قبل دخول النار في يوم كان مقداره ألف سنة ، وناصبين لأنهم دائما يكونون في ذلك العمل قال الحسن : هذه الصفات كان يجب أن تكون حاصلة في الدنيا لأجل الله تعالى ، فلما لم تكن كذلك سلطها الله عليهم يوم القيامة على سبيل العقاب ( وأما الوجه الثاني ) : وهو أنها بأسرها حاصلة في الدنيا ، فقيل : هم أصحاب الصوامع من اليهود والنصارى وعبدة الأوثان والمجوس ، والمعنى أنها خشعت لله وعملت ونصبت في أعمالها من الصوم الدائب والتهجد الواصب ، وذلك لأنهم لما اعتقدوا في الله ما لا يليق به ، فكأنهم أطاعوا ذاتا موصوفة بالصفات التي تخيلوها فهم في الحقيقة ما عبدوا الله وإنما عبدوا ذلك المتخيل الذي لا وجود له ، فلا جرم لا تنفعهم تلك العبادة أصلا ( وأما الوجه الثالث ) : وهو أن بعض تلك الصفات حاصل في الآخرة وبعضها في الدنيا ففيه وجوه ( أحدها ) : أنها خاشعة في الآخرة ، مع أنها كانت في الدنيا عاملة ناصبة ، والمعنى أنها لم تنتفع بعملها ونصبها في الدنيا ، ولا يمتنع وصفهم ببعض أوصاف الآخرة ، ثم يذكر بعض أوصاف الدنيا ثم يعاد ذكر الآخرة ، إذا كان المعنى في ذلك مفهوما فكأنه تعالى قال : وجوه يوم القيامة خاشعة ، لأنها كانت في الدنيا عاملة ناصبة في غير طاعة الله ، فهي إذن تصلى نارا حامية في الآخرة ( ثانيها ) : أنها خاشعة عاملة في الدنيا ، ولكنها ناصبة في الآخرة ، فخشوعها في الدنيا خوفها الداعي لها إلى الإعراض عن لذائذ الدنيا وطيباتها ، وعملها هو صلاتها وصومها ونصبها في الآخرة هو مقاساة العذاب على ما قال تعالى :{ وبدا لهم من الله ما لم يكونوا يحتسبون } وقرئ عاملة ناصبة على الشتم . ثم قال : \\" عاملة ناصبة \\" فهذا في الدنيا ؛ لأن الآخرة ليست دار عمل . فالمعنى : وجوه عاملة ناصبة في الدنيا \\" خاشعة \\" في الآخرة . قال أهل اللغة : يقال للرجل إذا دأب في سيره : قد عمل يعمل عملا . ويقال للسحاب إذا دام برقه : قد عمل يعمل عملا . وذا سحاب عمل . قال الهذلي 3 : حتى شَآهَا كَلِيلٌ مَوْهِنًا عَمِلٌ *** باتَتْ طِرَابًا وباتَ الليلُ لم يَنَمِ \\" ناصبة \\" أي تعبة . يقال : نصب ( بالكسر ) ينصب نصبا : إذا تعب ، ونصبا أيضا ، وأنصبه غيره . فروى الضحاك عن ابن عباس قال : هم الذين أنصبوا أنفسهم في الدنيا على معصية اللّه عز وجل ، وعلى الكفر ، مثل عبدة الأوثان ، وكفار أهل الكتاب مثل الرهبان وغيرهم ، لا يقبل اللّه جل ثناؤه منهم إلا ما كان خالصا له . وقال سعيد عن قتادة : \\" عاملة ناصبة \\" قال : تكبرت في الدنيا عن طاعة اللّه عز وجل ، فأعملها اللّه وأنصبها في النار ، بجر السلاسل الثقال ، وحمل الأغلال ، والوقوف حفاة عراة في العرصات ، في يوم كان مقداره خمسين ألف سنة . قال الحسن وسعيد بن جبير : لم تعمل لله في الدنيا ، ولم تنصب له ، فأعملها وأنصبها في جهنم . وقال الكلبي : يجرون على وجوههم في النار . وعنه وعن غيره : يكلفون ارتقاء جبل من حديد في جهنم ، فينصبون فيها أشد ما يكون من النصب ، بمعالجة السلاسل والأغلال والخوض في النار ؛ كما تخوض الإبل في الوحل ، وارتقائها في صعود من نار ، وهبوطها في حدور منها . إلى غير ذلك من عذابها . وقال ابن عباس . وقرا ابن محيصن وعيسى وحميد ، ورواها عبيد عن شبل . عن ابن كثير \\" ناصبة \\" بالنصب على الحال . وقيل : على الذم . الباقون ( بالرفع ) على الصفة أو على إضمار مبتدأ ، فيوقف على \\" خاشعة \\" . ومن جعل المعنى في الآخرة ، جاز أن يكون خبرا بعد خبر عن \\" وجوه \\" ، فلا يوقف على \\" خاشعة \\" . وقيل : \\" عاملة ناصبة \\" أي عاملة في الدنيا ناصبة في الآخرة . وعلى هذا يحتمل وجوه يومئذ عاملة في الدنيا ، ناصبة في الآخرة ، خاشعة . قال عكرمة والسدي : عملت في الدنيا بالمعاصي . وقال سعيد بن جبير وزيد بن أسلم : هم الرهبان أصحاب الصوامع . وقاله ابن عباس . وقد تقدم في رواية الضحاك عنه . وروى عن الحسن قال : لما قدم عمر بن الخطاب - رضي اللّه عنه - الشام أتاه راهب شيخ كبير متقهل 4 ، عليه سواد ، فلما رآه عمر بكى . فقال له : يا أمير المؤمنين ، ما يبكيك ؟ قال : هذا المسكين طلب أمرا فلم يصبه ، ورجا رجاء فأخطأه ، - وقرأ قول اللّه عز وجل - \\" وجوه يومئذ خاشعة . عاملة ناصبة \\" . قال الكسائي : التقهل : رثاثة الهيئة ، ورجل متقهل : يابس الجلد سيء الحال ، مثل المتقحل . وقال أبو عمرو : التقهل : شكوى الحاجة . وأنشد : لَعْواً 5 إذا لاقَيْتَهُ تَقَهْلاَ والقهل : كفران الإحسان . وقد قهل يقهل قهلا : إذا أثنى ثناء قبيحا . وأقهل الرجل تكلف ما يعيبه ودنس نفسه . وانقهل ضعف وسقط . قاله الجوهري . وعن علي رضي اللّه عنه أنهم أهل حروراء . يعني الخوارج الذين ذكرهم رسول اللّه صلى اللّه عليه وسلم فقال : [ تحقرون صلاتكم 6 مع صلاتهم ، وصيامكم مع صيامهم ، وأعمالكم مع أعمالهم ، يمرقون من الدين كما تمرق السهم من الرميَّة . . . ] الحديث . { عاملة ناصبة } ، قال ابن عباس والحسن وابن جبير وقتادة : { عاملة } في النار ، { ناصبة } تعبة فيها لأنها تكبرت عن العمل في الدنيا . قيل : وعملها في النار جر السلاسل والأغلال ، وخوضها في النار كما تخوض الإبل في الوحل ، وارتقاؤها دائبة في صعود نار وهبوطها في حدور منها . وقال ابن عباس أيضاً وزيد بن أسلم وابن جبير : عاملة في الدنيا ناصبة فيها لأنها على غير هدى ، فلا ثمرة لها إلا النصب وخاتمته النار ؛ والآية في القسيسين وعباد الأوثان وكل مجتهد في كفره . وقال عكرمة والسدي : عاملة ناصبة بالنصب على الذم ، والجمهور برفعهما . وقوله : { عَامِلَةٌ نَاصِبَةٌ } أي : قد عملت عملا كثيرا ، ونصبت فيه ، وصليت يوم القيامة نارا حامية . وقال الحافظ أبو بكر البرقاني : حدثنا إبراهيم بن محمد المُزَكّى ، حدثنا محمد بن إسحاق السراج ، حدثنا هارون بن عبد الله ، حدثنا سيار 7 حدثنا جعفر قال : سمعت أبا عمران الجَوني يقول : مر عمر بن الخطاب ، رضي الله عنه ، بدير راهب ، قال : فناداه : يا راهب [ يا راهب ] 8 فأشرف . قال : فجعل عمر ينظر إليه ويبكي . فقيل له : يا أمير المؤمنين ، ما يبكيك من هذا ؟ قال : ذكرت قول الله ، عز وجل في كتابه : { عَامِلَةٌ نَاصِبَةٌ تَصْلَى نَارًا حَامِيَةً } فذاك الذي أبكاني 9 . وقال البخاري : قال ابن عباس : { عَامِلَةٌ نَاصِبَةٌ } النصارى . وعن عكرمة ، والسدي : { عَامِلَةٌ } في الدنيا بالمعاصي { نَّاصِبَةٌ } في النار بالعذاب والأغلال 10 . { عاملة } أي مجتهدة في الأعمال التي تبتغي بها النجاة حيث لا نجاة بفوات دار العمل فتراها جاهدة فيما كلفتها به الزبانية من جر السلاسل والأغلال وخوض الغمرات من النيران ونحو ذلك كأن يقال له : أدّ الأمانة ثم تمثل له أمانته في قعر جهنم ، فتكلف النزول إليها ثم يحملها على عنقه ويصعد في جبال النيران حنى إذا كاد أن يصل إلى أعلاها سقطت منه فيتكلف النزول إليها وهكذا ، وهذا بما كان يهمل العمل في الدنيا { ناصبة * } أي هي في ذلك في غاية التعب والدؤوب في العمل والاجتهاد - هذه رواية العوفي عن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما ، وذلك لأنهم لم يخشوا الله في الدنيا فلم يعملوا له فلم ينصبوا في طاعته أجسادهم فاضطرهم في ذلك اليوم إلى أعظم مما أبوه في الدنيا مع المضرة دون المنفعة ، ويجوز أن يراد بها الذين تعبوا ونصبوا في الدنيا أجسامهم وهم على غير دين الإسلام كالرهبان من النصارى بعد النسخ وزنادقة المتصوفة من الفلاسفة وأتباعهم ، بأن يكون ( وجوه ) مبتدأ و ( يومئذ ) خبره أي كائنة يومئذ ، ثم يقدر ما بعده في جواب سؤال سائل يقول : ما شأنها ؟ فأجيب بقوله خاشعة ، أي في الدنيا - إلى آخره ، وهذا قول ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما في رواية عطاء عنه . وقولُه تعالى : { عَامِلَةٌ ناصِبَةٌ } خبرانِ آخرانِ لوجوهٌ إذِ المرادُ بهَا أصحابُها أي تعملُ أعمالاً شاقةً تتعبُ فيها وهيَ جرُّ السلاسلِ والأغلالِ والخوضُ في النَّارِ خوضَ الإبلِ في الوحلِ والصعودُ والهبوطُ في تلالِ النارِ ووهادِها ، وقيلَ : عملتْ في الدُّنيا أعمالَ السوءِ والتذتْ بها فهيَ يومئذٍ في نصبٍ منها ، وقيلَ : عملتْ ونصبتْ في أعمالِ لا تُجدي عليهَا في الآخرةِ . قوله : { عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ } معنى { عاملة } أنها تعمل عملاً شاقاً . قال أهل اللغة : يقال للرجل إذا دأب في سيره : عمل يعمل عملاً ، ويقال للسحاب إذا دام برقه : قد عمل يعمل عملاً . قيل : وهذا العمل هو جرّ السلاسل والأغلال ، والخوض في النار . { نَّاصِبَةٌ } أي تعبة . يقال نصب بالكسر ينصب نصباً : إذا تعب ، والمعنى : أنها في الآخرة تعبة لما تلاقيه من عذاب الله . وقيل : إن قوله : { عَامِلَةٌ } في الدنيا إذ لا عمل في الآخرة : أي تعمل في الدنيا بالكفر والمعاصي ، وتَنْصَبُ في ذلك . وقيل : إنها عاملة في الدنيا ناصبة في الآخرة ، والأوّل أولى . قال قتادة { عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ } تكبرت في الدنيا عن طاعة الله ، فأعملها الله ، وأنصبها في النار بجرّ السلاسل الثقال وحمل الأغلال والوقوف حفاة عراة في العرصات { فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ } [ المعارج : 4 ] قال الحسن وسعيد بن جبير : لم تعمل لله في الدنيا ولم تنصب فأعملها وأنصبها في جهنم . قال الكلبي : يجرّون على وجوههم في النار . وقال أيضاً : يكلفون ارتقاء جبل من حديد في جهنم ، فينصبون فيها أشد ما يكون من النصب بمعالجة السلاسل والأغلال والخوض في النار كما تخوض الإبل في الوحل . قرأ الجمهور { عاملة ناصبة } بالرفع فيهما على أنهما خبران آخران للمبتدأ ، أو على تقدير مبتدأ ، وهما خبران له ، وقرأ ابن محيصن وعيسى وحميد وابن كثير في رواية عنه بنصبهما على الحال أو على الذم . { عَامِلَةٌ } على ما قيل وهو وقوله تعالى : { نَّاصِبَةٌ } خبر إن آخران لوجوه إذ المراد بها أصحابها وفي ذلك الاحتمالات أخر ستأتي إن شاء الله تعالى أي عاملة في ذلك اليوم تعبة فيه وذلك في النار على ما روى عن ابن عباس والحسن وابن جبير وقتادة وعملها فيها على ما قيل جر السلاسل والأغلال والخوض فيها خوض الإبل في الوحل والصعود والهبوط في تلالها ووهادها وذلك جزاء التكبر عن العمل وطاعة الله تعالى في الدنيا وعن زيد بن أسلم أنه قال أي عاملة في الدنيا ناصبة فيها لأنها على غير هدى فلا تمرة لها إلا النصب وخاتمته النار وجاء ذلك في رواية أخرى عن ابن عباس وابن جبير أيضاً والظاهر أن الخشوع عند هؤلاء باق على كونه في الآخرة وعليه فيومئذ لا تعلق له بالوصفين معنى بل متعلقهما في الدنيا ولايخفى ما في هذا الوجه من البعد وظهور أن العمل لا يكون في الآخرة بعد تسليمه لا يجدي نفعاً في دفع بعده وقال عكرمة عاملة في الدنيا ناصبة يوم القيامة والظاهر أن الخشوع على ما مر ولا يخفى ما في جعل المحاط باستقباليين ماضوياً من البعد وقيل الأوصاف الثلاثة في الدنيا والكلام على منوال . إذا ما انتسبنا لم تلدني لئيمة *** أي ظهر لهم يومئذ أنها كانت خاشعة عاملة ناصبة في الدنيا من غير نفع وأما قبل ذلك اليوم فكانوا يحسبون أنهم يحسنون صنعاً وهؤلاء النساك من اليهود والنصارى كما أخرجه ابن أبي حاتم عن ابن عباس ويشمل غيرهم مما شاكلهم من نساك أهل الضلال وهذا الوجه أبعد من أخويه . فهي : ( عاملة ناصبة ) . . عملت لغير الله ، ونصبت في غير سبيله . عملت لنفسها وأولادها . وتعبت لدنياها ولأطماعها . ثم وجدت عاقبة العمل والكد . وجدته في الدنيا شقوة لغير زاد . ووجدته في الآخرة سوادا يؤدي إلى العذاب . وهي تواجه النهاية مواجهة الذليل المرهق المتعوس الخائب الرجاء ! والعاملة : المكلفة العَمَل من المشاق يومئذ . و { ناصبة } : من النصب وهو التعب . وأوثر وصف { خاشعة } و { عاملة } و { ناصبة } تعريضاً بأهل الشقاء بتذكيرهم بأنهم تركوا الخشوع لله والعمل بما أمر به والنصبَ في القيام بطاعته ، فجزاؤهم خشوع مذلّة ، وعمل مشقة ، ونصَب إرهاق . لخص المقال","output":"في أن العبارة \\"عاملة ناصبة\\" تعني أن الأشخاص الذين تطبق عليهم هذه الوصفة
