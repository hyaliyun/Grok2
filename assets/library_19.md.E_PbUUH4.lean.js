The Australian government minister has called the accolade \\"bad taste,\\" while MP Keith Vaz has described the decision as \\"distasteful and disgraceful.\\" Many believe that Christian's actions contributed to Saldanha's suicide, and the decision to award him is seen as insensitive to her family and friends. The incident sparked a debate about prank calls and their potential consequences. While some argue that they are harmless fun, others point out that they can have serious implications, as seen in this case. The tragedy has also led to increased scrutiny of media ethics and the responsibilities of broadcasters. In light of these developments, it is important for media outlets to take a more thoughtful approach to their content and consider the potential impact of their actions. While entertainment is important, it should never come at the expense of someone's wellbeing.

This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in nonEuropean art music and in popular music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles lend themselves to the song form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can attain a high level of complexity.

In order to find out how many more households than families were in the county in 2000, we need to calculate the difference between their numbers. According to the US Census Bureau, a family is defined as a group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption. In contrast, a household is defined as a person or a group of people who reside in the same housing unit, regardless of their relationship with one another. In 2000, the total number of households in the county was 100,000. Meanwhile, the total number of families was 80,000. To find out how many more households than families there were in the county in 2000, we simply subtract the number of families from the number of households: 100,000 - 80,000 = 20,000 Therefore, there were 20,000 more households than families in the county in 2000. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as an increase in the number of individuals living alone, or the presence of non-family groups residing in the same housing units. Nonetheless, it is important to note that both households and families are crucial units of analysis in understanding population trends and living arrangements, and that their differences and similarities are important considerations for policymakers, researchers, and social scientists alike."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: Recovery software mac for digital storage media recovers accidentally deleted pictures audio video songs clipping photographs snapshots office files and important documents from all types of USB digital media Mac file restore program for removable device easily searches and recovers all lost data using inbuilt advanced disk scanning mechanismData rescue for Mac can recover deleted file from Mac external hard disk flash drives mp3mp4 players portable media players flash memory devices and other mass storage device","output":"Recovery software for Mac, for digital storage media, recovers accidentally deleted pictures, audio, video songs, clipping photographs, snapshots, office files, and important documents from all types of USB digital media.

This can be a good option for families who have outgrown their current floor plan or for those who want a quiet space to work or relax. Adding insulation or finishing an attic can also be a viable option for creating more space. An unfinished attic can often be insulated and finished off relatively quickly, providing extra living space at a fraction of the cost of an addition.

Kinsman: They feel freed. ... I am thrilled for them and yet unexpectedly adrift They sent objects from childhood, which began to pile up on her desk at work.","output":"Kat Kinsman's parents have moved away from the Kentucky house where she spent her childhood. While they feel liberated from their old home, Kinsman finds herself feeling unexpectedly lost. Her parents sent her belongings from her childhood, which have begun to accumulate on her desk at work. This influx of memories serves as a reminder of the past and the sense of loss she is feeling in the present. As children grow up, they often associate a sense of comfort and familiarity with their childhood home. For Kinsman, her Kentucky home held a special place in her heart, full of memories and experiences that shaped who she is today. Her parents' decision to move away from that home, therefore, was a significant one, both for them and for her. For her parents, the move represented freedom from an old way of life, a chance to start anew. However, for Kinsman, it was not so simple. As she watched them pack up their belongings and say goodbye to their old home, she began to feel a sense of unease. Her sense of comfort and familiarity was being uprooted, and the stability she had come to rely on was being replaced by uncertainty. To make matters worse, Kinsman's parents began to send her belongings from her childhood, which only served to remind her of all that she was leaving behind. These items started to pile up on her desk at work, a physical manifestation of the past that she was struggling to come to terms with. In many ways, the presence of these keepsakes served as a direct contrast to the freedom her parents must have been feeling in their new home. In summary, Kat Kinsman's parents' move from her childhood home has left her feeling unexpectedly adrift. While her parents may feel liberated from the past, Kinsman is struggling to come to terms with the changes. The objects from her childhood that have accumulated on her desk at work serve as a reminder of all that she has left behind, and the sense of loss that comes with it.

The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles. In this way, it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules. In addition, cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion, ion conductivity and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures, including the cell wall, the carbohydrate layer called the glycocalyx, and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton.

Study offers hope drug could wipe traumatic events, phobias and hangups. Experiments carried out at Virginia Commonwealth University, US.","output":"Scientists at Virginia Commonwealth University in the US have conducted experiments on mice that indicate that the drug fingolimod could help individuals forget traumatic events, phobias, and hang-ups. The study found that mice given the drug were less likely to recall previous experiences that brought them pain. This is a significant development for those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), phobias or anxiety disorders. These individuals often experience intense and recurring negative memories and emotions associated with traumatic events, and these memories can have a significant and lasting impact on an individual's mental health and wellbeing. Fingolimod, which is already used to treat multiple sclerosis, works by blocking the activity of certain cells in the immune system. This, in turn, may cause a reduction in inflammation and may impact the way that the brain processes information. The researchers believe that by reducing inflammation, fingolimod may also impact the formation and consolidation of memories, making it easier for individuals to forget traumatic experiences. While the study was conducted on mice, the findings offer hope that the drug could be used to treat PTSD, phobias, and anxiety disorders in humans. The researchers are now planning to conduct further studies to determine if the same effects can be replicated in humans. In conclusion, this groundbreaking study conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University offers a potential new approach to treating PTSD, phobias, and anxiety disorders. Fingolimod, a drug that is already approved for use in multiple sclerosis patients, may hold the key to helping individuals forget traumatic experiences and move forward with their lives. Further studies are required, but the results are promising and offer hope to those who suffer from the debilitating effects of traumatic memories."},{"instruction":"Fortunately, it is less easy to conjure up the smells of that time.

Bees, flies, and even wind serve to pollinate plants in their natural habitat. Indoor plants are sheltered from these animals and elements. To compensate for this, pollinate indoor plants by hand. If your flowers on fruit trees are dying before the fruit sets in, flower pollination may not be occurring. One reason for this might be that the pollinator that typically pollinates that plant (for example a particular species of moth) does not live in your area. This can happen if you have plants that are not naturally found in your region. You will need to pollinate these plants by hand. By hand pollinating, you can select exactly which two flowers you want to cross. This allows you to create flowers that exhibit specific traits. Hybrid flowers may be a new color, grow taller, or have some other feature that neither of the parent flowers has.

The context of this question pertains to the Korean War, specifically the events leading up to the Panmunjom Axe Murder Incident. In October 1952, Lieutenant Colonel Allen K. Potter, commander of the 8th Cavalry Regiment in Korea, was informed that the North Korean People's Army (NKPA) had been cutting down trees in the Joint Security Area (JSA) located in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The JSA was jointly guarded by the United States and North Korea and was meant to be a neutral location for negotiations between the two sides. Potter ordered a verbal warning to be given to the North Koreans, but they continued to cut down the trees. On October 29th, a team of eight American soldiers led by Lieutenant Hugh Clowers Thompson, Jr. was sent to observe the NKPA's tree-cutting activities. While there, the North Koreans attacked with axes, killing two of the American soldiers, Pvt. First Class Ralph E. Pickett and Pvt. First Class Harold E. Dawson, and injuring four others. After the attack, Bonesteel, the chief of staff of the United Nations Command in Korea, formed a working group to investigate the incident and recommend a response. The working group was led by Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley and included representatives from the United States, South Korea, and the United Nations Command. The working group concluded that a retaliatory attack was not warranted as it could escalate the conflict. Instead, they recommended that the United Nations Command demand an apology and punishment for those responsible for the attack. The North Koreans eventually apologized and agreed to pay reparations. In conclusion, Bonesteel formed a working group before any retaliatory attack was staged in response to the Panmunjom Axe Murder Incident. The working group's recommendation of a diplomatic response was successful in resolving the incident without further escalation of the conflict."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.","output":"The movie was simply fantastic!

The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as zemirot outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During the Three Weeks musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49day period of the counting of the omer between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semimourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time. This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as sefirah music.","output":"Title of the article: \\"Jewish Tradition and the Use of Musical Instruments\\""},{"instruction":"We really enjoyed our whole experience!

This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes.

The diary and accompanying letters paint a disturbing picture of a marriage marred by abuse and neglect. Frances describes Reggie as an abusive drunk who neglected her and their children. In her diary, she recounts instances of physical and emotional abuse, describing Reggie's violent outbursts and his tendency to drink heavily. She writes that he was \\"always drunk and slurring,\\" and that he often kept a stash of weapons by his bed, including a knife under his pillow. The diary sheds light on the dark and dangerous world of the Krays, who were notorious gangsters in 1960s London. The Krays terrorized the city with their criminal activities, which included racketeering, protection rackets, and murder. Frances' accounts of Reggie's behavior offer a glimpse into the personal life of one of Britain's most notorious criminals.

The letters are addressed to Frances from various family members and friends, and offer expressions of sympathy and support during what must have been a challenging time.

Refrain from touching herpes sores. Be open to different types of sexual activity.","output":"Herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. It is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. While the virus is manageable, it can cause painful outbreaks that can spread through sexual contact. Therefore, recognizing the symptoms of a herpes outbreak is crucial in preventing the spread of the infection. The symptoms of a herpes outbreak usually appear within two to twenty days after infection. The infected person may experience a tingling or burning sensation on the skin, followed by the appearance of small, painful blisters or sores. The sores may appear on or around the genitals, anus, or mouth, and may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and swollen glands. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to consider avoiding sex during an outbreak. This will not only prevent the spread of the virus but also reduce the risk of further irritation and discomfort. Using condoms or dental dams during sexual intercourse can also help prevent the transmission of the virus, even if you do not have visible sores. If you or your partner have herpes, it is essential to refrain from touching herpes sores. This is because the virus can spread easily from one area of the body to another, or to another person. Therefore, it is crucial to keep the affected area clean and dry and avoid touching it as much as possible. Finally, it is crucial to be open to different types of sexual activity. While penetrative sex can pose a higher risk of transmitting the virus, other forms of sexual activity, such as mutual masturbation or using sex toys, can be safer options. With the right precautions and safe sexual practices, herpes can be managed, and the risk of transmission can be minimized. In conclusion, herpes is a manageable condition that requires vigilance and safe sexual practices to prevent the spread of the virus. Recognizing the symptoms of a herpes outbreak, using condoms or dental dams, refraining from touching herpes sores, and being open to different types of sexual activity can go a long way in reducing the risk of transmission and managing the virus. Remember, communication, honesty, and safe sex practices are essential in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted infections."},{"instruction":"Q: IndyMac offered this type of questionable loans to borrowers?

The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry.

However, the decision has sparked criticism from the lawyers representing the plaintiffs who accuse Zedillo of crimes against humanity. The plaintiffs' lawyers argued that Zedillo had knowledge of the events that led to the killings and that his office was responsible for the deaths. They also claimed that Zedillo should have taken action to prevent the killings. Despite the accusations, Zedillo maintains his innocence and denies any involvement in the deaths of the Indian villagers. He has said that his administration did everything it could to investigate the incident and bring those responsible to justice. The United States has supported the decision to grant Zedillo immunity, stating that he is not liable for the actions of lower-level officials. However, the plaintiffs' lawyers strongly disagree with this stance, arguing that Zedillo was fully aware of the situation and could have prevented the loss of innocent lives.

Symptoms typically include numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and wrist. If you are experiencing these symptoms, there are several methods to alleviate symptoms and prevent further damage. Firstly, taking regular breaks is essential in preventing CTS. It is recommended to take a break every 20 to 30 minutes of repetitive hand movements to give the wrist and hand a rest. Additionally, during these breaks, applying a cold or ice pack can help reduce swelling and inflammation in the affected area. Wearing a splint on your wrist while performing repetitive tasks can decrease pressure on the median nerve and prevent further damage. There are many types of wrist splints available, so it is essential to talk to your doctor to determine which one is best suited for your specific needs. Yoga is a helpful tool in decreasing CTS symptoms. Certain poses, such as the downward dog, can help alleviate wrist pain and increase flexibility. Additionally, massage therapy can help loosen up tight muscles and increase circulation in the wrist and hand. Treat trigger points by massaging the affected area, which is typically the forearm, to help decrease pain and decrease pressure on the median nerve. Additionally, healthcare professionals can offer ultrasound or hand therapy to further alleviate symptoms. Taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help with both pain and inflammation in the wrist and hand. However, it is essential to consult with your doctor before taking any medication. If symptoms persist, corticosteroids may be an option. This medication can be taken orally or injected into the affected area to relieve symptoms. Surgery is also an option, but it is typically reserved for severe cases. In conclusion, taking regular breaks, using cold or ice packs, wearing a splint, practicing yoga, trying massage therapy, treating trigger points, considering ultrasound or hand therapy, taking NSAIDs, speaking to your doctor about corticosteroids, and considering surgery are all methods to alleviate CTS symptoms.

Obama will announce his immigration plans tonight at 8 p.m. EST but the major networks won't carry it live. He is expected to halt deportations for illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children and parents of American citizen children.","output":"Possible article: Obama's Immigration Plan Sparks Controversy and Threats of Legal Action by GOP Governors President Barack Obama's highly anticipated announcement of his new immigration policies tonight has incurred the wrath of Republican governors who are already threatening to challenge his executive action in court. The most outspoken critics are Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who blasted Obama's plan as illegal and divisive. \\"I would go to the courts,\\" Walker said on Wednesday, before Obama's speech, \\"This is illegal.\\" He added that Obama's proposal would hurt job prospects and wages for American workers and create more uncertainty for employers. Walker, who is considering a presidential bid for the GOP in 2016, argued that Obama was overstepping his authority by bypassing Congress and imposing a \\"unilateral, unconstitutional\\" policy on the nation. Similarly, Perry accused Obama of \\"sticking his finger into the eye of the American people\\" by defying the will of Congress and ignoring the rule of law. Perry, who also ran for president in 2012 and may run again in 2016, hinted that Texas might join other states in a legal challenge to Obama's actions. \\"We will not sit idly by while the president undermines the rule of law and disregards the Constitution,\\" Perry said in a statement. The main target of Obama's plan is to address the plight of millions of undocumented immigrants who have been living in the U.S. for many years but are facing the risk of deportation. According to White House officials, Obama will use his executive powers to grant temporary relief from deportation to nearly five million people, including those who came to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers, and their parents who have children with U.S. citizenship or legal status. The policy change will allow these immigrants to apply for work permits and stay in the country for up to three years without fear of removal, if they pass a background check and pay taxes. The immigration reform, which has been postponed by Congress for years, is a highly contentious issue that divides Democrats and Republicans along ideological and political lines. Obama's move could provoke a fierce backlash from the right, who accuse him of rewarding lawbreakers and expanding a culture of amnesty that encourages more illegal immigration. Many Republicans argue that Obama is abusing his powers and undermining the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. The controversy over Obama's immigration plan is likely to intensify in the coming days and weeks, as more lawmakers, pundits, and activists weigh in on the merits and limits of executive action, immigration policy, and constitutional law. The fact that major networks, including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, have decided not to air Obama's speech live, may also underscore the deep divisions and polarization in American politics and media. As of now, it is unclear how the legal challenges and political fallout from Obama's immigration plan will affect his legacy, the future of his party, and the fate of millions of immigrants living in limbo in the U.S."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

The truce was initially signed to end a long-standing conflict between the two sides over issues such as territorial disputes and economic rivalry. During the truce period, the Swiss Confederacy grew stronger and more cohesive, thanks to their successful military campaigns against neighboring territories. However, tensions between the Confederacy and the Habsburgs never truly dissipated, and in 1356, the Habsburgs revoked the truce, citing violations by the Confederacy. The Battle of Sempach occurred in 1386, when the Habsburgs led an army of knights and mercenaries against the Swiss Confederacy. Despite being outnumbered and out-armed, the Swiss Confederacy was victorious in the battle. This victory solidified the Confederacy's independence and led to the eventual collapse of the Habsburg dynasty's control in the region. In conclusion, the truce between the Swiss Confederacy and the Habsburgs that began in 1313 lasted for 24 years before tensions between the two sides boiled over into the Battle of Sempach.

First of all, it’s best to buy the turkey breast by the pound rather than pre-packaged. This ensures that you are getting the freshest meat possible. If you do end up with a frozen turkey breast, make sure to thaw it completely before cooking. Once your turkey breast is ready to go, you’ll want to remove any packaging and give it a good rinse under cold water. From there, you have the option of marinating the breast to infuse it with additional flavor. You can try using a store-bought marinade or create your own with simple ingredients like olive oil, garlic, and herbs. When cooking your turkey breast, it’s important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure that it reaches the right temperature and is fully cooked. Some recipes call for roasting the breast in the oven, while others recommend using a slow cooker. Whichever method you choose, be sure to check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer to ensure that it has reached at least 165°F. By keeping these tips in mind, you can prepare a delicious turkey breast that is juicy and full of flavor.

Human rights activists have been lobbying for Posada's extradition to Venezuela, where he is accused of bombing a Cuban plane in 1976, killing 73 people. Cuba also wants him extradited for allegedly masterminding a series of hotel bombings in Havana in 1997 that killed an Italian tourist. Despite these accusations, Posada has been living freely in the United States under political asylum since 2005. The recent acquittal and extradition block have sparked outrage among those who seek justice for the victims of his attacks. In the end, the Posada case remains a contentious issue that has divided opinions on justice, freedom, and anti-communist activism. The story of Luis Posada will continue to be a case study for the power of political influence and the consequences of violent resistance."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: United Kingdom LANGUAGE English language; United Kingdom LEADER_NAME David Cameron; AIDS (journal) COUNTRY United Kingdom; United Kingdom CAPITAL London; AIDS (journal) PUBLISHER Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilk","output":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins is the publisher of a journal called AIDS that talks about the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome; it is a publication in the United Kingdom, where the official language is the English language and the leader's name is David Cameron, and it is a country with its capital located in London."},{"instruction":"f A woman and three children, holding hands with each other, are crossing the street., does this mean that The woman is the mother of the three children.?

The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand.

To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene.

While some may be mild and easy to manage, others can be quite uncomfortable and even painful. Fortunately, there are some things that can be done to help alleviate the discomfort. Here are five tips for relieving skin rash discomfort: 1. Wash your skin: Keeping your skin clean is crucial when it comes to managing rashes. Use a mild soap and warm water to gently remove any dirt, oils, or other irritants that may be lingering on your skin. 2. Avoid touching the rash: Resist the urge to scratch or touch the rash. This can lead to further irritation and possibly infection. If you must touch it, be sure to wash your hands first. 3. Soak in an astringent bath: Adding an astringent, such as oatmeal or baking soda, to your bathwater can help soothe the skin and reduce inflammation. Soak for 10-15 minutes and then rinse with cool water. 4. Soak in a bath: Simply soaking in cool water can also help to reduce skin irritation and relieve itching. Avoid using hot water, as this can further irritate the skin. 5. Use cool compresses: Applying a cool compress to the affected area can help to reduce inflammation and relieve itching. Simply soak a clean cloth in cool water and apply it to the rash for 10-15 minutes at a time. Following these five tips can help to relieve the discomfort of a skin rash.

Officials from both clubs will hold talks as Barca look to strike deal.","output":"Barcelona president, Josep Bartomeu, has confirmed that the Catalan club is actively searching for a forward and defenders to bolster their ranks. After finishing last season without a major trophy, for the first time in six years, the club is keen to get back to their winning ways. To that end, Barcelona and Liverpool have opened talks over the transfer of Luis Suarez. Barcelona officials are set to meet with their Liverpool counterparts to discuss a potential deal for Suarez. The striker, who has been linked with a move away from Anfield for some time, is said to be keen on a move to the Camp Nou. Barcelona, meanwhile, are in need of attacking reinforcements after losing Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain last summer. The talks between the two clubs are expected to be protracted and fraught, with Liverpool understood to be holding out for a sizeable transfer fee. Suarez is regarded as one of the best strikers in Europe, having scored 32 goals in the Premier League last season. For Barcelona, the addition of Suarez would be a major boost to their attacking options. The Uruguayan would link up with Lionel Messi and Ousmane Dembele in what would be an incredibly potent front three. However, the club is also aware that they need to strengthen their defence if they are to compete for major honours in the coming season. Bartomeu's confirmation that Barcelona is actively searching for defenders is a clear indication that the club is aware of this fact. The Catalans have been linked with a number of players in recent weeks, including Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld and Ajax's Matthijs de Ligt. Overall, it is clear that Barcelona is determined to bounce back from last season's disappointments. Their pursuit of Luis Suarez and efforts to sign defensive reinforcements are a clear indication of their ambition to challenge for domestic and European honours once again."},{"instruction":"Context: Coming off their win over the Jaguars the Colts flew to OaklandAlameda County Coliseum for an AFC duel with the Raiders.

The 20-year-old suffers from rare and mysterious condition known as Kleine-Levin Syndrome. This neurological disorder causes her to endure sleeping episodes that can last for weeks at a time, during which she remains practically unresponsive to the outside world. But that's not all, Lois also experiences troubling personality changes that can include babbling like a small child, becoming agitated or even violent, and exhibiting impulsive behavior. During one of her episodes, she even pierced her ears and dyed her hair red. Lois' condition is so rare that it affects only a few hundred people worldwide. While the primary symptom is excessive sleep, sufferers can also experience odd cognitive and behavioral changes, with many reporting significant memory loss during episodes. KLS can be severely debilitating to both the individual experiencing it and their loved ones. Doctors believe the disorder is caused by a malfunction in the hypothalamus, which regulates sleep and other autonomic functions. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for KLS, and treatment is limited to managing symptoms. Living with KLS can be challenging, but Lois and her family are taking it one day at a time, hoping for a better tomorrow.

Dorsett's run began at his own one-yard line, where he received the handoff from his quarterback. Despite facing a stacked line of defenders, he was able to break through and make his way up the field. He eluded several tackles, used his speed to outrun the secondary, and crossed the goal line 99 yards later.

Authorities were on high alert and seeking leads in order to prevent further attacks. During this time, a suspicious package was discovered in the city of Ryazan, located approximately 100 miles southeast of Moscow. The package was found in an apartment building and was said to contain explosives. However, subsequent investigation revealed that the package was not an actual bomb, but rather a crude imitation designed to look like one. This sparked a controversy, as the FSB (Russia's Federal Security Service, formerly known as the KGB) had initially claimed that the package was, in fact, a genuine bomb. Speculation began to emerge that the incident had been orchestrated by the FSB itself, in an effort to drum up support for the government's response to the bombings. This was further fueled by the fact that the FSBexperts who examined the package had initially claimed that it contained the same explosive used in the previous bombings, but later the substances were found to be sugar. Despite the controversy, it is clear that the incident in question took place in Ryazan, not in the suburbs of Moscow. While there were certainly bombings and other violent incidents in and around Moscow during this time period, the events in Ryazan were distinct and separate. In conclusion, while the episode in Ryazan certainly played a significant role in the larger context of the bombings and Russia's response to them, it is important to recognize that it was a separate incident from those that occurred in the suburbs of Moscow."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, recently expressed his criticisms of President Obama's second hundred days in office. In Steele's opinion, the second hundred days have been worse than the first due to the massive spending on liberal priorities that Obama's programs call for. One of Steele's main points of contention is the cap-and-trade bill, which he believes is a disguised energy tax on average Americans. According to him, this bill will not only increase energy costs but also lead to job losses across the country. Steele argues that it is unfair to expect average Americans to bear the brunt of the costs of this program, while big corporations are exempt from it. Another major concern for Steele is the proposed health care reform, which he claims would be costly and lead to government control. He argues that the government's involvement in the health care system could lead to a decrease in the quality of care and create a bureaucratic nightmare for patients and healthcare providers. Steele's criticisms of Obama's programs are not new. Many Republicans have expressed similar concerns about the president's policies over the last few years. However, the fact that a former chairman of the Republican National Committee is coming out so strongly against Obama's second hundred days shows just how contentious these policies have become. Regardless of one's political persuasion, it is clear that Obama's programs have sparked a heated debate in the country. Many Americans are concerned about the long-term effects of these policies on the economy and individual freedoms. As the debate continues, it will be interesting to see how the Obama administration responds to the criticisms and whether they will be able to allay the concerns of those who remain skeptical."},{"instruction":"What is a onesentence summary of the following article?
