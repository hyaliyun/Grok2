The code should be located on a tag beneath or on the bottom of the furniture. If in doubt, hiring a professional cleaner is always a good option. However, if you prefer to clean the furniture yourself, begin by vacuuming the item to remove any loose dirt and debris. For deeper cleaning, create a mixture of lemon juice and baking soda to remove stains. It’s important to first test the mixture on an inconspicuous area of the furniture to ensure that it doesn’t cause any damage. Next, gently wipe away any stains with a soft cloth, making sure not to rub too hard as this can damage the fabric. After cleaning, allow the furniture to dry thoroughly before using it again. This usually takes a few hours, but can vary depending on the type of fabric and level of cleaning required.

Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes the enduring Phantom of the Opera storyline and moves it into a late '80s shopping mall. However, the Phantom's goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family. The special effects do provide a good chuckle, especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect, mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV fame had not yet arrived.

Make sure cords are tucked away or hidden, and any damaged cords are replaced promptly. Lastly, if you're trying to redirect your cat's behavior, distraction can be an effective method.

It is the dry, powdery resin that is collected from cannabis buds and can be an excellent addition to any smoking experience. Although kief can be added to many smoking methods, there are a few ways to consume it that can maximize its potency and flavor. One way to smoke kief is to use it by itself. This method may produce the most intense effect, as there are no other substances to dilute the potency. Just load a small amount of kief into a pipe or vaporizer, and take a hit or two. However, be mindful of your dose, as it can be easy to overdo it. Another way to consume kief is to crown a packed bowl. This refers to placing a layer of kief on top of a bowl of ground marijuana. By doing this, heat from the bowl will vaporize the kief and mix with the other cannabis to enhance its effects. This method is perfect for those who prefer a more controlled dosage. If you enjoy rolling joints, adding kief to the mix can elevate your smoking experience. Use kief to line the rolling paper before filling it with ground cannabis, allowing the kief to be evenly distributed throughout the joint. This can create a smoother burn, as well as a more flavorful and potent smoking experience. Finally, if you are a fan of tobacco, you can mix kief with your tobacco in a spliff. The addition of kief can enhance the tobacco’s effects and flavor, giving a subtle, yet noticeable boost to your smoking routine. In conclusion, kief can be an excellent addition to any smoking experience. Whether you choose to smoke it by itself, crown a bowl, line a joint, or mix it with tobacco, kief can bring out the best in your cannabis consumption. Remember, when it comes to consuming kief, less is often more, so be mindful of your dosage and enjoy the ride."},{"instruction":"Moors Murderer Myra Hindley had trysts in prison with female warder.

Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food.

Ronald Koeman's side is currently sitting in third place in the Premier League, ahead of the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal. This win is particularly significant given that Southampton lost several key players over the summer transfer window including Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert. Despite this, Ronald Koeman has done a brilliant job of rebuilding the team and keeping them in contention at the top of the table. The victory against Newcastle was not without its challenges, though. The home team had their fair share of chances and could have easily equalized had they been more clinical in front of goal. However, it was the visitors who took their opportunities and secured all three points. Southampton's success this season can be attributed to the contributions of several key players. Graziano Pelle has been a revelation up front, scoring 8 goals in 11 league appearances. Dusan Tadic has also been impressive, registering 5 assists and 3 goals. Victor Wanyama has been a rock in midfield, breaking up opposition attacks and allowing his side to launch counter-attacks. The win over Newcastle is just the latest in a string of impressive performances from Southampton. They have already beaten the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham this season, and look like genuine contenders for a top-four finish. It's clear that Ronald Koeman has built a fine side in the absence of several key players, and it will be interesting to see if they can maintain their momentum in the coming weeks."},{"instruction":"(1) He plays three keyboards , which he uses with a stick attached to the neck of his guitar .

However, few people know the critical role played by Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani physician who had been hired by the CIA to help locate bin Laden. Afridi had run a vaccination drive in Abbottabad, where bin Laden was believed to be hiding. The goal was to obtain DNA samples from the residents to confirm bin Laden's presence in the area. The effort was successful, and bin Laden was eliminated by US special forces in a daring raid. However, Afridi's role in the operation had not gone unnoticed by the authorities in Pakistan. The Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, arrested the doctor and charged him with \\"conspiring against the state.\\" In 2012, Afridi was convicted and sentenced to 33 years in prison. Eventually, the conviction was overturned, but Afridi was not released. Instead, he was remanded in prison pending a new verdict, which is due to be delivered on December 18. Meanwhile, the doctor's supporters have expressed concern about his well-being. A letter purportedly written by Afridi and smuggled out of the prison reveals that he is being held in complete isolation, deprived of access to his lawyers, and subjected to \\"mental torture.\\" The plight of Shakil Afridi highlights the challenging and often murky world of international espionage and intelligence gathering. While he played a crucial role in eliminating one of the world's most wanted terrorists, the doctor has paid a heavy price for his involvement.

In basketball, the first field goal can be made by any player on the court. It is often the result of the opening tip-off, where the team that gains possession of the ball has the opportunity to score the first points of the game. In football, the first field goal can be made by either team, depending on which team possesses the ball first. If a team starts on offense and successfully moves the ball down the field, they may attempt a field goal in order to score points. Likewise, if a team starts on defense and is able to create a turnover or force a punt, they may try to block the ensuing kick or return it for a touchdown, resulting in the first points of the game. In soccer, the first field goal can be credited to any player who successfully scores a goal. This goal can come at any point in the game, and can be scored by either team. It is often a significant moment in the match, and can set the tone for the rest of the game. In conclusion, the identity of the player who makes the first field goal of a game is dependent on a variety of factors, including the sport in question, the possession arrow or coin toss, and the strategy employed by each team. Nonetheless, this moment is often one of great excitement and anticipation, and can have a significant impact on the remainder of the game."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question Shortterm memory is also known as working memory. Shortterm memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity is also very limited: George A. Miller (1956), when working at Bell Laboratories, conducted experiments showing that the store of shortterm memory was 7±2 items (the title of his famous paper, The magical number 7±2). Modern estimates of the capacity of shortterm memory are lower, typically of the order of 4–5 items; however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking. For example, in recalling a tendigit telephone number, a person could chunk the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 123), then a threedigit chunk (456) and lastly a fourdigit chunk (7890). This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.

Therefore, whenever your shoes get wet, whether from rain, sweat, or cleaning, it is crucial to let them dry thoroughly before wearing or storing them. Another essential factor in shoe care is proper storage. Keeping your shoes in a box can protect them from external elements and keep them organized. Avoid piling shoes on top of each other, as this can damage the shape and design. Additionally, it is recommended to store shoes in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture and heat from affecting their quality. Lastly, prolonged exposure to the sun can cause significant damage to your shoes, causing colors to fade and materials to crack. Therefore, avoid leaving your shoes in direct sunlight, especially for extended periods. In conclusion, taking care of your shoes is essential to maintain their quality, appearance, and longevity.

The first step is to preheat your oven to a low temperature, around 325°F. This allows the bread to warm up gradually, which helps prevent the inside from being too dry while the outside is still cold. If the bread has a hard crust, you can add a small amount of water to the inside of the foil before wrapping the bread. This helps create steam inside the foil, which softens the crust. If the crust is already soft, you can skip this step. Wrap the bread in foil and place it on a baking sheet. Heat it in the oven for 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the loaf. If the crust is still too hard, you can unwrap the bread and bake it for another five minutes. But be careful not to leave it in the oven for too long, or it will become hard and dry. Once the bread is soft and warm, take it out of the oven and unwrap it. Leave it to cool for a few minutes before slicing and eating. This helps prevent the bread from becoming too soggy and ensures it's still enjoyable to eat. It's important to eat the bread soon after reheating it, as it will start to dry out again if allowed to sit for too long.

He was known for his powerful leg and accuracy in making field goals from long distances. Over the course of his career, he made numerous impressive kicks, but two of his longest field goals stand out from the rest. The first of Brown's top two longest field goals came during a game between the Houston Texans and the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 12, 2006. With just two seconds left in the first half, Brown came onto the field to attempt a field goal from a whopping 57 yards away. Despite the difficult angle and the pressure of the situation, Brown nailed the kick straight through the uprights, giving the Texans a solid lead heading into halftime. This kick tied Brown’s career-long field goal at the time. The second of Brown's longest field goals was also made during a game between the Texans and the Jaguars on December 30, 2007. In the fourth quarter of the game, Brown stepped onto the field to attempt a 57-yard field goal once again. The pressure was on, as the Texans were down by two points with just over two minutes left on the clock. However, Brown didn't let the pressure get to him, and he booted the ball through the goalposts with plenty of room to spare. This impressive kick gave the Texans a one-point lead and helped secure a crucial victory for the team. These two kicks are a testament to Kris Brown's incredible skill as a placekicker. They demonstrate his ability to perform under pressure and his incredible accuracy from long distances. Although he retired from the NFL in 2011, his name lives on in the record books thanks in large part to these two impressive kicks."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

Williams shared that Dorner worked in a high-stress environment, and that over time, this could have taken a toll on his mental well-being. She also noted that Dorner tended to internalize his feelings, which likely contributed to his eventual breakdown. Dorner, a former Los Angeles police officer, made headlines in 2013 when he allegedly went on a violent rampage that left several people dead. Williams, who worked with Dorner while he served in the Naval Reserve, recalled that he was a diligent worker but also had a tendency to keep to himself. Given the nature of his work, Williams said, it was natural that Dorner would experience a great deal of stress. \\"It's a pressure cooker,\\" she remarked. \\"You have to be able to compartmentalize and detach yourself from some of the things that you do.\\" But it seems that Dorner had a hard time letting go of the things that bothered him. Williams recounted an incident in which Dorner was upset with a fellow officer for using a racial slur, and how this incident stayed with him for days afterwards. All of these factors, Williams suggested, may have contributed to Dorner's unraveling. \\"He bottled up a lot of his emotions,\\" she said, \\"and I think that eventually caught up with him.\\" Although Williams didn't condone Dorner's violent actions, she did express sympathy for the man she once knew. \\"He was a good person,\\" she said, \\"but he was also a person who had a lot of issues.\\""},{"instruction":"Read this fact: crumple means change shape from smooth into compacted by physical force Now answer this question: A person takes a page out of a book and crumples it, so the page is OPTIONS: flat smooth torn round","output":"round"},{"instruction":"A symphonic song cycle can either refer to a symphony composed of separate movements played consecutively or to a set of symphonic works linked by theme, common composer, or common conductor.

The article highlighted the dangerous consequences of extreme dieting, which can have serious health implications, including premature death.

In response to this tragic event, Hollywood food expert Dr Willis recommended a healthy diet plan that emphasized moderation and balance. The diet consisted of whole, nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. This plan provided all the necessary nutrients for optimal health, without resorting to extreme measures such as counting calories or restricting certain food groups. While the pressures of Hollywood's beauty standards still exist to this day, it is imperative that we prioritize our health and well-being over societal expectations.

Even the most skeptical among Rome's intellectual elite such as Cicero, who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.

Whether dressing up for a formal event or keeping it casual for a day out with friends, picking the right pair of pants can elevate any outfit. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when selecting an appropriate pair of pants. Firstly, it's essential to choose a streamlined pant. This means opting for pants that fit well, without being too tight or too loose. A streamlined pant provides a clean silhouette that can be dressed up or down. Choosing a pant that fits well can do wonders for your confidence and overall appearance. Another crucial factor is to select pants that are made with lighter fabrics. Heavier fabrics, such as wool or corduroy, can be too bulky and add unnecessary weight to an outfit. Light fabrics such as cotton or linen provide a more delicate touch, making them perfect for warmer weather. Skinny jeans and pants are an excellent choice for anyone looking for a chic and modern edge to their outfits. While skinny pants may not appeal to everyone, they can provide a flattering yet trendy look when styled correctly. Lastly, matching the drape of the dress with the drape of the pants can be a game-changing technique. Creating a harmonious flow between a dress and pants creates a cohesive look that makes a statement. For example, if you opt for a dress with flowing fabric, it would be an excellent idea to pair it with wide-leg pants of a similar flowy material. In conclusion, pants are not just a functional piece of clothing, but they offer an excellent opportunity to make a fashion statement. By selecting a streamlined pant, utilizing lighter fabrics, trying skinny jeans and pants, & matching the drape of a dress and pants, you're sure to look and feel confident in any outfit you choose."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

Prior to the earthquake, the United States government allocated 500,000 to protect Haitian children from trafficking. The need for such protection was evident, as UNICEF had already collected anecdotal evidence about the trafficking of Haitian children. Unfortunately, the earthquake only exacerbated the situation, leaving countless children without homes, caretakers, or protection. The chaos and confusion that followed the disaster created an environment ripe for exploitation, including trafficking. Without proper resources and support, children were at increased risk of being lured into labor or sexual exploitation. According to the International Labour Organization, an estimated 12.3 million people worldwide are \\"laboring in bondage\\", including forced labor and human trafficking. Whether in Haiti or elsewhere, these individuals face not only physical abuse but also isolation, economic exploitation, and a lack of basic human rights. In the aftermath of natural disasters, aid organizations must prioritize not only immediate relief efforts but also protection strategies for those most at risk, including children. The U.S. government's investment in pre-earthquake prevention efforts for Haitian children was a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to provide ongoing support and protection. We cannot forget that human trafficking is a global issue that affects millions of people, and it is incumbent upon us to work towards its eradication.

The \\"three Rs\\" provide a foundation for a child's education and achieving a level 4 in these subjects is crucial for their future success. Schools that fail to meet these targets need to re-evaluate their teaching methods and resources.

Fall in Hispanic turnout came perhaps because the President didn't issue the immigration order The people who were against us felt more strongly than the people for us, Clinton says. His remarks come at a weekend retrospective on his administration.","output":"Former President Bill Clinton recently made remarks suggesting that President Barack Obama's decision to postpone action on immigration reform may have hurt Democrats with Hispanic voters. According to Clinton, the fall in Hispanic turnout during the 2014 midterm elections may have been due to the President's failure to issue the immigration order. Clinton said, \\"The people who were against us felt more strongly than the people for us.\\" Clinton made these remarks during a weekend retrospective on his administration. He implied that Democrats could have lost some support from Hispanic voters due to Obama's inaction on immigration reform. However, Clinton also acknowledged that there were other challenges that Democrats faced during the 2014 elections. The former President's comments may reflect some frustration among Democrats over Obama's handling of immigration reform. Many Democrats had hoped that Obama would issue an executive order on immigration before the 2014 elections, but he ultimately decided to delay action until later that year. Some Democrats fear that this hesitation may have contributed to the decline in Hispanic turnout in 2014. The issue of immigration reform has been a contentious one for both Democrats and Republicans in recent years. However, the issue is particularly important for Hispanic voters, who make up a growing share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that the party needs to be more vocal in its support for immigration reform in order to win over Hispanic voters. Overall, Clinton's comments suggest that Democrats may need to do more to win over Hispanic voters, particularly on the issue of immigration reform. Whether or not Democrats will be able to do so remains to be seen, but these remarks serve as a reminder of the challenges that the party faces in the coming years."},{"instruction":"The agenda I'm trying to put together for the next meeting will include the customary presentations from Davies/Lindsay and Kristol as well as the energy policy discussion we are looking for from you and Bob.

However, not everyone learns the same way. Each person has their unique way of absorbing and retaining information. This is why it is important to evaluate your learning style, determine what it is, and incorporate it into your approach. The three main learning styles are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Visual learners prefer to learn through pictures, diagrams, and other visual aids. Auditory learners learn better through listening and music. Kinesthetic learners prefer hands-on learning experiences. To determine your learning style, pay attention to how you best remember information. Do you prefer reading articles or watching videos? Do you tend to remember things better after hearing them spoken out loud? Or, do you learn better through hands-on experiences such as participating in lab experiments? Once you have determined your learning style, it is essential to incorporate it into your approach. If you are a visual learner, try to incorporate more pictures and diagrams into your studies. If you are an auditory learner, try recording lectures and listening to them later. For kinesthetic learners, try incorporating more hands-on activities into your studies. Incorporating your learning style into your approach can significantly improve your academic performance. It will help you absorb and retain information more effectively and reduce the amount of time you need to spend studying. Moreover, it will make learning more enjoyable and engaging, leading to a lifelong love of learning.

Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system). However, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose.

They are a crucial component of our transportation system and a key element of our economy. The problem is, many of our bridges are simply not up to par. They are old, outdated, and in desperate need of maintenance. Yet, despite the pressing need for repairs, many politicians are unwilling to invest the necessary funds. This has led to a dangerous situation in which our bridges are at risk of failing. Wise urges Americans to take action before it's too late. \\"We cannot wait for disaster to strike before we start paying attention to these issues,\\" he argues. \\"We need to be proactive in addressing the problem, rather than waiting for it to become a national tragedy.\\" So, what can we do to address this issue? Wise recommends that we start by pressuring our elected officials to invest in infrastructure repairs. We also need to become more aware of the state of our nation's bridges and take steps to ensure their safety. This includes supporting organizations that are working to promote bridge safety and taking a more active role in our own communities. In short, Walter Wise is urging Americans to take action before it's too late. Our nation's bridges are in dire need of repair, and we cannot afford to wait for disaster to strike.

Using three popular snack brands, Wyburn was able to bring his fine art skills to the snack aisle. Wyburn's medium of choice for this project included Mini Cheddars, Twiglets and Cream Crackers. The artist carefully pieced together the snack foods to capture the likeness of some of the world's most well-known personalities. Among the creations were crisp versions of supermodel Cara Delevingne, actor Will Smith, and singer Ariana Grande. The use of snack foods as an artistic medium is nothing new for Wyburn. In recent years, he has received widespread recognition for his work that includes portraits of public figures made from ketchup and creamed rice. He has also created a portrait of David Beckham using Marmite. The crisp creations, however, highlight Wyburn's ability to transform everyday objects into highly realistic artwork.

We need stronger border control and stricter policies to ensure the safety of our citizens.

But to achieve these benefits, it's important to create the right environment for meditation. Finding a quiet, uncluttered room with space for a mat is the ideal starting point for your meditation routine. Here are some tips for creating the perfect meditation environment: Choose a quiet room Meditation requires a calm and peaceful environment to help you focus on your breathing and quiet your mind. Choose a quiet room away from any distractions such as TVs or other noise-producing devices. If possible, select a room with minimal outside noise such as traffic. If outside noise is unavoidable, consider using earplugs or a sound machine. Clear the clutter A cluttered space can be distracting and make it difficult to concentrate on your meditation practice. Take a few minutes before your meditation session to tidy up the room. Remove any unnecessary items and reserve the space for your meditation practice. You may find that simply decluttering the room has a calming effect that helps you focus. Create space for a mat A mat provides a comfortable surface for your meditation practice. Choose a mat that is comfortable and has enough space for you to sit comfortably. The size of the mat will depend on your body size and the space you have available. Roll out the mat and position it in a spot that feels comfortable to you. Add spiritual trinkets or totems If you have any spiritual trinkets or totems that you like to meditate with, place them nearby. These items may include crystals, statues, or other items that hold personal significance. Having these items nearby can help you focus on your spiritual practice and bring a sense of peace and tranquility. In conclusion, creating a peaceful and uncluttered space for meditation can help you achieve the full benefits of this powerful practice. Finding a quiet room, clearing the clutter, creating space for a mat, and adding any spiritual trinkets or totems are all steps you can take to create an environment that supports your meditation practice. With the right surroundings, you can unlock the full potential of your meditation practice and reap the many benefits it provides for your mind, body, and soul."},{"instruction":"Reports on the Delhi relay were similarly distinct.

While cats are relatively self-sufficient, they still require proper care to stay healthy. Here are a few tips to keep your cat feeling their best. First, it's important to consult with your veterinarian to determine if your cat needs any medical intervention. Cats can be prone to certain health issues, such as dental disease, urinary tract problems or allergies. Your vet can provide recommendations for preventative care or treatment options, to keep your cat on the right track. If your cat requires medication, make sure to administer it according to your vet's instructions. It can be tempting to skip a dose, but sticking to a regular medication schedule is crucial. Consider pairing medication time with a specific activity or event, such as mealtime, to help make it a routine. Another way to promote good health in your cat is to add pureed pumpkin or butternut squash to their food. These vegetables are high in fiber, which can help with digestion, and many cats find them quite tasty. It's important to introduce any new food in small amounts at first, to see how your cat responds. Overall, the key to keeping your cat healthy is to stay proactive. Schedule regular check-ups with your veterinarian, listen to their advice, and be mindful of your cat's behaviors and body condition.

Now at 52 years old, Li has spent the past year building two rotor engines using a dismantled motorbike. The skeletons of the aircraft consist of angle iron and stainless steel tubes, while the rotors themselves are comprised of four welded steel plates. Despite the somewhat ramshackle nature of his creation, Li is determined to succeed. He recently tested the aircraft and claims to have achieved a remarkable 40cm of altitude. While this may not sound like a lot, it's an impressive feat for someone who has taken on such a daunting project entirely on his own. Li's passion and dedication to his project are truly inspiring. Many people might have given up on such an undertaking, but for Li, the challenge seems to be what motivates him. He has poured countless hours into this aircraft and clearly believes that with enough effort and ingenuity, anything is possible.

The Argentine forward scored twice in the match, helping his team secure a 4-2 win. However, Messi's accomplishment did not stop there.

Messi's incredible scoring ability has once again been highlighted, and with nine more matches to go, he has a chance to beat Gerd Muller's record of 85 goals set in 1972. The possibility of Messi achieving this impressive feat is not unimaginable, considering the kind of form he is in this season. Meanwhile, his rival, Cristiano Ronaldo, faced a setback in Real Madrid's victory after suffering an eye injury. Although the exact extent of the injury is still unknown, the incident has raised concerns among Real Madrid fans, who are hoping Ronaldo will recover in time for their upcoming games. Messi and Ronaldo have been neck-and-neck in most scoring records, and their rivalry has undoubtedly kept football enthusiasts at the edge of their seats. However, Messi has certainly surged ahead in the ongoing season with his remarkable goal-scoring ability.

Infectious and parasitic diseases have historically been a leading cause of death, particularly in developing countries. However, global health initiatives and advances in medical treatments have led to a significant decrease in deaths from these diseases. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, malaria deaths have decreased by 60% since 2000 and HIV/AIDS deaths have decreased by 39% since 2010. On the other hand, digestive system diseases such as liver disease and pancreatitis have been on the rise in many countries. This is largely attributed to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and unhealthy diets. In the United States, liver disease has become one of the leading causes of death, with deaths increasing by 65% between 1999 and 2016. Overall, while infectious and parasitic diseases have seen a greater decline in deaths in recent years, it is important to address the growing trend of digestive system diseases.

The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as electrons. It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities. For Whitehead, the term prehension indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them.

In some cases, kickers may attempt a field goal even if it is beyond their usual range. This is typically done towards the end of the game if a team is behind and needs to score quickly. However, attempting a longer field goal is riskier because the ball has to travel further and is more likely to be blocked by the opposing team.
