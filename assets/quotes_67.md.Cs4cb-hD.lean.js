Hikaye yaklaşık 2000 kelime uzunluğunda olmalıdır.","output":"Brigitte Bardot Fotoğrafçı Önünde İç Çamaşırını Çıkarıyor Bir zamanlar güzeller güzeli olan Brigitte Bardot, bir fotoğrafçıyla buluşmak üzere Paris'in en ünlü moda stüdyosuna giderken heyecanla doluydu. O gün, dergilerde çıkan son moda iç çamaşırı koleksiyonunu tanıtmak üzere birçok seksi poz vermeyi planlamıştı. Cesur ve özgür ruhlu Bardot'nun kendi bedenini sergilemekten çekinmediği herkes tarafından biliniyordu. Stüdyoya adım attığında, fotoğrafçı olan Louis onu sıcak bir gülümsemeyle karşıladı. Bardot, elindeki iç çamaşırı setlerinden birini Louis'ye uzatarak, ona işbirliği yapmayı teklif etti. İkisi de bu projenin heyecan verici olacağını biliyordu. Bardot soyunma odasına geçerken içeriye bir anda kafası şişmiş kemancı geldi. Kemancı, Lady Marmalade adlı bir şarkıyı çalmaya başladı. Bardot, bu süre zarfında ruhunu ve bedenini iç çamaşırlarıyla uyumlu hale getirmeye çalıştı. Kendini bir kadın olarak kabullenme duygusu ona güven vermişti ve Brigitte, bedeninin yanı sıra iç çamaşırlarının müthiş bir kombinasyon oluşturacağına inanıyordu. Üzerine siyah bir sütyen giydi ve üzerine mavi dantelli bir külot geçirdi. Aynada kendisine baktığında, bu iç çamaşırlarının ona çekici bir hava kattığını fark etti. Zaman içinde Brigitte Bardot, güzelliği ve özgürlüğüyle tüm dünyanın beğenisini kazanmıştı ve bu iç çamaşırları, onun imajını güçlendirmek için harika bir seçim olduğunu düşündü. Bardot seksi bir jartiyer ve çorap takmaya karar verdi. Bu kombinasyon, şimdiye kadar giydiği en cesur iç çamaşırı seçimlerinden biriydi. Ne zaman soyunma odasına gelse, kendine özgüveni yükseliyordu. Artık hazırdı ve fotoğrafçı Louis ile buluşmak için stüdyoya geri döndü. Stüdyoya girdiğinde, Bardot'nun üzerindeki iç çamaşırlarını gören Louis, hayranlıkla ona baktı. Onun zarafeti ve cesareti karşısında şaşkına dönen fotoğrafçı, bu kareleri yakalamanın bir ayrıcalık olduğunu anladı. Bardot, kamera karşısında nasıl poz vereceğini biliyordu. Her bir hareketi kasıtlı ve etkileyiciydi. Güneşin tenine vurduğu anlarda, Louis'nin objektifinden mükemmel bir şekilde yansıyacaktı. Brigitte Bardot bir sandalyede oturdu ve dizlerini yukarı kaldırdı. Bacaklarının arasında bulunan jartiyeri, kamera için cazip bir detay olarak kullanarak, Bardot birçok farklı poz verdi. Fotoğrafçı Louis, her hareketinde onun doğal güzelliğini yakalamak için çabalıyordu. Bardot'nun cesaretine ve güzelliğine hayran kalan Louis, her pozu daha fazlasını istemeye itiyor. Onun vücudu, iç çamaşırlarının yanı sıra, kameraya çekici bir şekilde yansıyordu. Bardot dişlerini gösteren bir gülümsemeyle Louis'ye baktı ve yavaşça sandalyeden kalktı. Fotoğrafçıyı şaşırtarak önünde dans etmeye başladı. Bardot, kendini müziğe kaptırmış ve içindeki erotik duyguları dışa vurmuştu. Her hareketi, güzelliğini ve zerafetini sergiliyordu. Gösteri bittiğinde, Bardot'nun terlemiş bedeniyle Louis'nin objektifi arasında unutulmaz kareler oluşmuştu. Bardot soluğu fotoğraf stüdyosundan çıkmak için alırken, Louis ona bakarken nefes kesildi. Bardot'nun doğal güzelliği ve cesaretine tanık oluşu, onun için mükemmel bir deneyim olmuştu. İki sanatçı arasında bir bağ vardı ve birlikte yarattıkları bu başyapıtın sonsuza kadar hatırlanacağını biliyorlardı. Ertesi gün, moda dergilerinde Brigitte Bardot'nun fotoğrafları yayınlandı. Herkes onun cesaretine ve güzelliğine hayran kaldı. İç çamaşırı reklamı tüm dünyada büyük ses getirdi ve Brigitte Bardot, bir kez daha moda dünyasının gözdesi haline geldi.

Hikaye yaklaşık 2000 kelime uzunluğunda olmalıdır.","output":"Brigitte Bardot Fotoğrafçı Önünde İç Çamaşırını Çıkarıyor Günün ilk ışıklarıyla birlikte Paris sokaklarına tüy gibi savrulan bir rüzgar, 1950’lerin havasını taşıyordu. Şehrin güzelliği, tüm büyüsüyle sokağa taşmıştı. O sabah, duygusal bir romantizm hüküm sürüyordu. İşte tam da bu romantik havada, Brigitte Bardot adında muhteşem bir güzellik tezahür etti. Brigitte, Paris'in en ünlü model ajansında çalışıyordu. O, sadece Avrupalıların hayran olduğu bir güzellik değildi; tüm dünya, onun o eşsiz cazibesine hayrandı. Cannes Film Festivali'ndeki göz alıcı performansları onu kısa sürede dünyaca ünlü bir isim haline getirmişti. Güzellik, bardağın dolu tarafından hayatın nefes kesici maceralarına sürüklenir. Brigitte Bardot, bu gerçeği bizzat deneyimlemiş biriydi. Birçok kez büyüleyici güzelliği altında kendisine adanmış sayısız aşk hikayeleri yaşamıştı. Aşkta bulduğu hazzı, her gün daha fazla istiyordu. Bir sabah, ajansının yöneticisi Maurice ile özel bir görüşme için randevulaştı. Maurice, büyük bir fotoğrafçılık stüdyosu olan Boudoir Studio'dan bahsetti ve Brigitte'e, iç çamaşırı konseptli bir çekim yapmak istediklerini söyledi. Bu fikir Brigitte'i heyecanlandırdı çünkü bazen sıradışı şeyler yaşamaya özlem duyuyordu. Üstelik sürekli gündeme gelen ve erotik sahnelerde boy gösterme isteği de cabasıydı. O gün geldiğinde, Boudoir Studio’nun etkileyici atmosferi karşısında Brigitte çok etkilendi. Odanın çiçek kokuları, zarif perdeleri ve metalik aksesuarları, iç çamaşırlarının romantizmini tamamlıyordu. Fotoğrafçı Maxime, Brigitte’e yaklaştı ve ona çekimin nasıl ilerleyeceği hakkında bilgi verdi. Atmosferdeki erotik hava, salaş bir cazibeye dönüşüyordu ve Bardot, bunu hissetmeye başlamıştı. Maxime, ışık ve gölgelerle oynamanın fotoğraflara daha da derinlik kattığını söyledi ve Brigitte’e daha önce yapmadığı hiçbir şeye benzetilemeyecek bir şeyin peşinden gitti. Aniden, Bardot'un iç çamaşırlarını giydiği kırmızı ipek fantezi giyim odasına geçti. Bu, Brigitte için merak uyandırıcı bir deneyimdi çünkü sapkın olmakla alakalıydı. Maxime, odanın içine biraz sis saldı ve o büyülü atmosferi tamamlamak için hafif bir tını çalmaya başladı. Bardot, iç çamaşırlarını üzerinden çıkardığında, onun nefes alıp veren bir heykel gibi donduğunu hissetti. Bardot, mükemmelliğinin zirvesindeyken, kendini erotik bir deneyime kaptırmıştı. Maxime'in gözleri, onda tutkuyu ve arzuyu derinden hissedebiliyordu. Birlikte çalıştıkları her dakikada aralarındaki kimya ateşe dönüşüyordu ve Paris'in romantik havasına biraz daha katık yapıyordu. Fotoğraf çekimleri bittiğinde, Bardot iç çamaşırlarını tekrar giymek için odaya geri döndü. İçerideki sis dağıldı ve gölgeler internete sızdı. Maxime, Brigitte’in güzelliği karşısında büyülenmişti ve onunla daha ileri bir ilişkiye adım atmaya cesaret edemiyordu. Brigitte ise cesur bir kadındı. İç çamaşırıyla geri geldiğinde, Maxime'in gözlerinin içine bakarak ona yaklaştı ve aralarındaki elektriklenmeyi hissetti. O andan itibaren, Brigitte ve Maxime arasında ateşli bir aşk başlamıştı. Paris, her ne kadar romantik bir şehir olsa da, Brigitte ile Maxime arasındaki aşk, bu romantizmi daha da büyütüyordu. İkisi, her fotoğraf çekimi sonrası yatakta bir araya gelerek tutkularını özgürce yaşadılar. Birbirlerini keşfetmek için sabırlıydılar ve her dokunuş, her öpücük, kalplerinin ritmini hızlandırıyordu. Brigitte Bardot ve Maxime, birbirlerine karşı koruyucu ve tutkulu bir bağ hissettiler. Bu ilişki, ikisinin de hayatında eşsiz bir deneyim sunmuştu. Nihayetinde, Paris aşklarıyla dillere destan olmuştu. Brigitte Bardot Fotoğrafçı Önünde İç Çamaşırını Çıkarıyor hikayesi, bir yıldırım aşkıyla başladı ve sürekli kışkırtıcı bir erotik havada ilerledi. Bu hikaye, iki ruhun birleştiği anı konu alıyor ve tutkulu bir aşkın ateşini yükseltiyor. Hikayenin sonunda, Brigitte ve Maxime’in aşklarının ateşi, Paris’in bedenlerinden havalanan bir rüzgar gibi tüm dünyaya yayıldı."},{"instruction":"give me a response to \`\`\`As a character from a classic literature satire, I would approach the situation with a sharp wit and an eye for irony.

Explain in a clear language how back propagation works, give formulas for calculating the weights of neurons on each layer, starting from the last one. Give an example using Python code.","output":"Back propagation is a popular algorithm used in neural networks to train models and update the weights of neurons. It enables the model to learn from the training data and make accurate predictions. Let's walk through the steps involved in back propagation and provide some formulas and examples. 1. Initialize Weights: - Start by assigning random weights to the neurons in each layer of the neural network. 2. Forward Propagation: - Take the input data and pass it through the neural network to obtain the predicted output. - Apply the activation function to the dot product of the input data and weights at each neuron. 3. Calculate Error: - Compare the predicted output with the actual output to compute the error. - Typically, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross Entropy Loss is used as the error function. 4. Backward Propagation: - Begin at the last layer (output layer) and calculate the derivative of the error with respect to the neuron weights. - Use the chain rule to propagate this derivative backward through each layer. - Adjust the weights in each neuron by multiplying the learning rate with the derivative and subtracting it from the current weights. 5. Update Weights: - Repeat steps 2-4 (forward and backward propagation) for a specified number of epochs. - After each epoch, update the weights based on the learning rate and derivatives obtained during back propagation. - The goal is to minimize the error and improve the accuracy of predictions. Here is an example of implementing back propagation in Python: \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Step 1: Initialize Weights np.random.seed(42) weights = [np.random.randn(2, 4), np.random.randn(4, 1)] # Step 2: Forward Propagation def forward_propagation(X, weights): hidden_layer_output = np.dot(X, weights[0]) activated_hidden_output = sigmoid(hidden_layer_output) predicted_output = sigmoid(np.dot(activated_hidden_output, weights[1])) return predicted_output, activated_hidden_output # Step 4: Backward Propagation def back_propagation(X, y, weights, learning_rate): # Forward propagation predicted_output, activated_hidden_output = forward_propagation(X, weights) # Calculate error error = y - predicted_output # Backward propagation output_derivative = sigmoid_derivative(predicted_output) hidden_derivative = sigmoid_derivative(activated_hidden_output) # Update weights using partial derivatives weights[1] += learning_rate * np.dot(activated_hidden_output.T, error * output_derivative) weights[0] += learning_rate * np.dot(X.T, np.dot(error * output_derivative, weights[1].T) * hidden_derivative) # Helper functions def sigmoid(x): return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x)) def sigmoid_derivative(x): return x * (1 - x) # Step 5: Update Weights (repeat for multiple epochs) X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]) y = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]]) epochs = 1000 learning_rate = 0.1 for epoch in range(epochs): back_propagation(X, y, weights, learning_rate) # After training, use forward propagation to get final predictions final_predictions, _ = forward_propagation(X, weights) print(final_predictions) \`\`\` In this example, we initialize the weights, pass the input through the network using forward propagation, calculate the error, and then adjust the weights in each neuron using back propagation. Repeat this for a specified number of epochs until the model converges and provides accurate predictions. Note: This is a simplified example using a simple neural network with two layers. In practical scenarios, neural networks may have more layers and complex architectures, requiring additional algorithms like stochastic gradient descent and regularization techniques."},{"instruction":"give me a response to \`\`\`Yes, that's right.

En avril (dernier mois pour lequel les données de l'Istat sont disponibles), le pourcentage de chômeurs est tombé à 8,4%. Le choc dû à la pandémie a donc été complètement absorbé et, si l'on allonge la période d'analyse, il faut remonter à 2010 pour trouver une valeur aussi basse. Mais les problèmes sont là, en filigrane. Tout d'abord, les emplois créés sont des emplois à durée déterminée, donc des emplois précaires. Ensuite, il s'agit d'emplois peu qualifiés et donc peu rémunérés. Enfin, le phénomène du chômage des jeunes reste très important et se maintient à un niveau beaucoup plus élevé : dans la tranche d'âge des 15-24 ans, le taux atteint 23,8 %. En comparaison annuelle avec avril 2021, la croissance du nombre de personnes employées est de 670 000 : dans plus de la moitié des cas, il s'agit de salariés à durée déterminée, dont l'estimation dépasse 3 millions 150 000, la valeur la plus élevée depuis 1977\\", lit-on dans la note de l'Istat accompagnant la dernière série de données sur l'emploi. \\"Le taux d'emploi reste à 59,9%, la valeur record enregistrée en mars 2022, et le taux de chômage s'élève à 8,4% ; le taux d'inactivité, qui s'élève à 34,6%, reste à des niveaux pré-pandémiques\\". L'un des grands déficits du marché du travail italien est le manque de compétences. Les jeunes qui sortent de l'école n'ont en effet pas les connaissances recherchées par les entreprises, et l'alternance école-travail, telle qu'elle est structurée en Italie, n'est pas en mesure de combler ce fossé. Un fossé rendu encore plus grand par l'avènement des nouvelles technologies, dont le développement est beaucoup plus rapide que celui du système éducatif. Selon les données recueillies par Eurostat, l'Italie est en queue de peloton, notamment en ce qui concerne les Neet, acronyme de Not in Education, Employment or Training, qui désignent les jeunes de 15 à 29 ans qui ne sont pas inscrits à l'école ou à l'université, qui ne travaillent pas et qui ne suivent même pas de formation, de stages ou de cours de remise à niveau professionnelle. Dans ce groupe, qui échappe souvent aux statistiques et aux institutions chargées d'insérer les chômeurs sur le marché du travail, on trouve, par exemple, les très jeunes qui ont terminé leur scolarité obligatoire et travaillent au noir, les démotivés, c'est-à-dire ceux qui ont cessé de chercher un emploi parce qu'après avoir obtenu leur diplôme, ils n'ont pas pu entrer immédiatement sur le marché, et les diplômés qui ont acquis des compétences immédiatement obsolètes par rapport à la demande des entreprises. Or, en Belpaese, il y a quatre des sept régions européennes où le pourcentage de Neet dépasse 25 %. Il s'agit du Molise (25,5 %), de la Calabre (26,5 %), de la Campanie (28 %) et de la Sicile (29,3 %). Les trois autres se trouvent en Bulgarie (Severozapaden, 27 %), en Grèce (Voreio Aigaio, 27,1 %) et en France (bien qu'il s'agisse en fait de la Guyane, 33,6 %, qui est un département d'outre-mer). Le chômage des jeunes est l'une des préoccupations les plus pressantes dans le domaine des politiques sociales et de l'emploi\\", peut-on lire dans l'annuaire régional 2021 d'Eurostat : \\"Les performances des marchés du travail des jeunes sont étroitement liées aux systèmes d'éducation et de formation et reflètent, du moins dans une certaine mesure, une inadéquation entre les compétences acquises par les jeunes et les compétences requises par les employeurs (pour pourvoir les postes vacants)\\". )\\". Selon l'enquête 2021 du système d'information Excelsior de l'Unioncamere et de l'Anpal, réalisée en collaboration avec le Centre d'études \\"G. Tagliacarne\\" des Chambres de commerce, en 2021, le pourcentage d'entreprises qui déclarent avoir des difficultés à trouver des professionnels ayant les compétences numériques requises a augmenté. Pour les compétences numériques, la difficulté à les trouver varie de 34,9 % pour les compétences de base à 37,8 % pour les compétences plus avancées ; pour les compétences mathématiques-informatiques, l'écart est encore plus grand (de 36 % à 40,3 %), tandis que pour les compétences 4.0, la difficulté varie de 37 % à 40,9 %. Dans l'ensemble, \\"les entreprises expriment un besoin d'emploi de plus de 177 000 figures professionnelles liées au domaine des TIC, dont environ la moitié peut être attribuée aux professions techniques, suivies par les professions intellectuelles, scientifiques et hautement spécialisées\\". Dans le premier groupe, on compte 29 000 programmeurs techniques, 23 000 experts en applications techniques et 14 000 techniciens en marketing. Parmi les professions hautement spécialisées, la demande la plus importante concerne les analystes et concepteurs de logiciels (25 000), les ingénieurs industriels et de gestion (16 000) et les ingénieurs mécaniciens (10 000). Et c'est précisément pour soutenir les entreprises dans leur processus de transformation numérique que le gouvernement a lancé le \\"crédit d'impôt formation 4.0\\", particulièrement favorable aux petites entreprises. Il est en effet reconnu à hauteur de 70 % des dépenses de formation éligibles dans la limite d'un plafond annuel de 300 000 euros. Pour les entreprises moyennes, le crédit d'impôt est ramené à 50 % des dépenses éligibles dans la limite d'un plafond annuel de 250 000 euros, et pour les grandes entreprises, il est encore réduit à 30 %, toujours dans la limite d'un plafond annuel de 250 000 euros.","output":"Le texte met en évidence les problèmes de l'emploi des jeunes en Italie. Bien que le taux de chômage global ait diminué à 8,4% en avril, les emplois créés sont majoritairement des emplois temporaires et peu qualifiés, ce qui entraîne une précarité et une faible rémunération. Le taux de chômage des jeunes âgés de 15 à 24 ans reste élevé, atteignant 23,8%. De plus, il y a un manque de compétences chez les jeunes sortant de l'école, et le système éducatif ne parvient pas à combler ce fossé, en particulier en raison de l'évolution rapide des nouvelles technologies. L'Italie se classe également en queue de peloton en termes de jeunes ne suivant ni études, ni emploi, ni formation. Certaines régions italiennes, notamment le Molise, la Calabre, la Campanie et la Sicile, ont des pourcentages de jeunes ne suivant ni études, ni emploi, ni formation dépassant les 25%. L'inadéquation des compétences acquises par les jeunes avec celles demandées par les employeurs est soulignée. Une enquête révèle que les entreprises ont du mal à trouver des professionnels ayant les compétences numériques nécessaires. Face à cela, le gouvernement italien a mis en place un crédit d'impôt pour la formation 4.0 afin d'aider les entreprises dans leur transformation numérique."},{"instruction":"give me a response to \`\`\`**His expression turns stern.** Hey, watch it!

What do you reccomend for software and genre?","output":"If you have zero experience producing music, but need to create something presentable within a day, I recommend starting with a simple and user-friendly digital audio workstation (DAW). For your Linux/Android environment, you can consider using the following software options: 1. Ardour: Ardour is a professional-grade open-source DAW available for Linux. It offers a wide range of features and can be a good choice for beginners as well. 2. Tracktion T7: Tracktion T7 is a free and intuitive DAW that works on Linux, offering a clean and simple interface, suitable for beginners. 3. FL Studio Mobile: If you are more inclined towards mobile-based production, FL Studio Mobile is a popular option available for Android. It provides a user-friendly interface and a range of tools to create music. As for the genre, starting with something simple and easy to produce might be a good idea given the time constraint. Here are a few genres you can consider: 1. Ambient: Ambient music usually focuses on creating atmospheric and relaxing soundscapes. It can be relatively simple to produce, involving layers of different sounds and effects. 2. Lo-fi Hip Hop: This genre has gained popularity in recent years and typically involves chilled-out beats, laid-back melodies, and sampling. It can be a great choice, especially if you have access to sample libraries or loops. 3. Electronic/Chillout: Creating electronic music with a chillout vibe allows you to experiment with different synthesizer sounds, drum patterns, and effects. It can be both relaxing and enjoyable to produce. Remember that with limited experience and time, it's important to keep your expectations realistic. Start simple, focus on creating a pleasant sound, and enjoy the process of creating music in your music class."},{"instruction":"give me a response to \`\`\`The principle that I strive to live by is to be kind and compassionate.

Красноярске в 1995 году с целью сохранения и изучения творческого наследия академика, народного художника Б. Я. Ряузова. Адрес: Ленина, 127 — центр города, рядом площадь Революции и сквер В. И. Сурикова, краевое правительство. Площадь публичного пространства: 130 кв.м., сложной конфигурации. Режим работы: ср-вс 11:00-19:00. По инициативе музея в городе наименованы Ряузовский переулок и Сквер имени Б.Я. Ряузова. Ряузов — ровесник СССР, знаковая фигура в традиционной художественной среде Красноярска. Участник Великой Отечественной войны, живописец, мастер сибирского пейзажа, лидер красноярского Союза художников в 1950-1970-х гг. Спустя 30 лет концепция музея — «Диалог поколений». В музее два экспозиционных зала, один посвящён Ряузову из коллекции музея, во втором меняются выставки современных, преимущественно красноярских художников, творящих в русле академической школы изобразительного искусства. Таким образом, пространство музея ведет диалог между 20 и 21 веком. В музее проходят творческие встречи, лекции, мастер-классы с участием признанных художников, преподавателей и выпускников художественного училища, художественного института. Задача Предложить формат небесплатного повторяющегося события в пространстве музея или от имени музея, которое может стать привлекательным для пользователей Пушкинской карты (ЦА — молодежь от 14 до 22 лет) на регулярной основе.","output":"Одно из возможных решений задачи может быть создание платформы для проведения фестивалей уличного искусства в пространстве музея. Это событие может быть организовано раз в месяц или раз в квартал для пользователей Пушкинской карты. Формат фестиваля уличного искусства может включать следующие активности: 1. Уличные выставки: на площади перед музеем можно установить временные конструкции, на которых будут представлены работы современных художников, вдохновленных творчеством Ряузова. Работы могут быть выполнены в различных стилях и техниках: граффити, фотографии, скульптуры и прочее. Это позволит привлечь внимание молодежи и показать им разнообразие искусства. 2. Лекции и мастер-классы: в рамках фестиваля можно провести лекции и мастер-классы с участием признанных художников, которые расскажут о творчестве Ряузова, его вкладе в искусство региона, а также поделятся своим опытом и знаниями. Это позволит молодежи не только узнать о художественном наследии, но и самим попробовать себя в искусстве. 3. Конкурсы и выставки работ: организовать конкурсы среди молодых художников, студентов и школьников, где они смогут представить свои работы, вдохновленные творчеством Ряузова. Лучшие работы могут быть выставлены в музее или на улицах города, чтобы они были доступны всем жителям и гостям Красноярска. 4. Фуд-корты и развлекательные активности: организовать фуд-корты с разнообразным стрит-фудом, где посетители могут отведать блюда разных культур. Также можно предложить различные развлекательные активности, такие как музыкальные выступления, танцы, игры и т.д., чтобы создать атмосферу праздника и увлекательного времяпровождения. Проведение такого фестиваля не только будет привлекательным для пользователей Пушкинской карты, но и способствует популяризации музея, привлечению новой аудитории и сохранению наследия Ряузова.

Les empreintes digitales sont des caractéristiques uniques de chaque individu, ce qui les rend idéales pour l'identification et la vérification de l'identité. La première étape de la conception consiste à collecter les empreintes digitales de chaque utilisateur potentiel. Cela peut être fait en utilisant un scanner d'empreintes digitales, qui capture l'image des empreintes digitales et les convertit en une représentation numérique. Une fois que les empreintes digitales ont été collectées, elles sont enregistrées dans une base de données sécurisée. Cette base de données peut être hébergée localement ou dans le cloud, selon les besoins de l'entreprise. Pour réaliser la vérification de l'identité, le système compare l'empreinte digitale de l'utilisateur avec celles enregistrées dans la base de données. Cette comparaison est effectuée en utilisant des algorithmes de reconnaissance d'empreintes digitales, qui comparent les caractéristiques de l'empreinte digitale capturée avec celles des empreintes digitales enregistrées. Une fois que l'identité de l'utilisateur est vérifiée, le système enregistre la présence de l'utilisateur dans un journal électronique. Ce journal peut être électronique, affichant les heures d'arrivée et de départ des employés, ou il peut être intégré à un système de gestion des ressources humaines existant. L'implémentation de ce système nécessite à la fois du matériel et des logiciels. Le matériel comprend un scanner d'empreintes digitales pour la capture des empreintes digitales, ainsi qu'un ordinateur ou un serveur pour héberger la base de données et les logiciels de reconnaissance d'empreintes digitales. En conclusion, la conception et l'implémentation d'un système de présence biométrique par empreinte digitale offre une méthode précise et fiable pour enregistrer et vérifier la présence des utilisateurs.

They typically fought in formations called legions, which consisted of around 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers. The soldiers were heavily armored, wearing a helmet, a breastplate, greaves (shin guards), and carrying a large rectangular shield called a scutum. In battle, Roman soldiers would arrange themselves in a defensive formation called a Testudo or \\"tortoise.\\" They would lock their shields together in a tight formation, covering themselves from head to toe and creating an impenetrable shield wall. When attacking, Roman soldiers would often use a stabbing motion with their stabbing swords (gladius) called a \\"thrust.\\" They would aim for unprotected areas such as the neck or the abdomen. The Roman soldiers' primary objective was to get up close and personal with the enemy, using their superior training and equipment to overpower their opponents. Additionally, Roman soldiers often employed other tactics such as throwing javelins (pila) at the enemy before charging into close combat. They also had specialized units such as cavalry (equites) and archers (sagittarii) to provide support during battles. Roman soldiers were highly disciplined and trained to follow orders without question. They would march in formation and maintain a strict chain of command on the battlefield. This discipline and organization gave them an advantage over less organized opponents. Overall, Roman soldiers were formidable fighters who used their training, tactics, and superior equipment to win battles and conquer large territories. Their fighting techniques and discipline played a significant role in the success of the Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"Resolved: The United States ought to prohibit the extraction of fossil fuels from federal public lands and waters.","output":"This statement presents a resolution that claims the United States should prohibit the extraction of fossil fuels from federal public lands and waters. As an AI language model, I do not possess personal opinions or beliefs, but I can outline a debate by presenting arguments for both the affirmative and negative sides. Affirmative arguments: 1. Environmental concerns: Prohibiting fossil fuel extraction from federal public lands and waters can help mitigate climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuels contribute significantly to global warming, and stopping their extraction could promote the adoption of cleaner energy sources. 2. Conservation of public lands: By prohibiting fossil fuel extraction, the government can safeguard public lands and protect wildlife habitats from the potential environmental harm caused by drilling, fracking, and other extraction methods. 3. Renewable energy promotion: Prohibiting fossil fuel extraction can incentivize the development and utilization of renewable energy sources, leading to a more sustainable and cleaner energy future. 4. Protection of water sources: Fossil fuel extraction can pose risks of contamination to groundwater and marine ecosystems. Prohibiting extraction would ensure the preservation and protection of water resources on federal lands and waters. Negative arguments: 1. Economic impact: Banning fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters can have a significant negative impact on local economies, as it may lead to job losses and reduced revenue from energy production. 2. Energy independence and security: The United States relies on fossil fuels for a significant portion of its energy needs. Prohibiting extraction could increase dependence on foreign energy sources, potentially compromising energy security. 3. Revenue loss: Fossil fuel extraction generates substantial revenue for the government through lease sales, royalties, and taxes. A prohibition could result in a loss of vital funds that support public services, infrastructure, and social programs. 4. Technological advancements: Blocking fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters can hinder technological innovations aimed at improving extraction methods, reducing environmental impacts, and transitioning to cleaner energy production. It's important to note that these arguments are not exhaustive and there are other points that can be made for both sides. To develop a comprehensive understanding and make an informed decision, one should consider various factors such as the environmental impact, economic consequences, and long-term sustainability when evaluating this resolution."},{"instruction":"can you present more arguments for aff and neg","output":"Certainly! Here are additional arguments for both the affirmative and negative sides: Additional affirmative arguments: 5. Public health benefits: Prohibiting fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters can reduce air and water pollution associated with extraction activities, improving public health outcomes and decreasing the incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. 6. Climate leadership and international cooperation: A prohibition on extraction can demonstrate the United States' commitment to combatting climate change, setting an example for other nations to follow. It may also foster international cooperation in developing sustainable energy solutions. 7. Land and cultural preservation: By preventing fossil fuel extraction, the government can protect culturally significant areas and historical sites that could otherwise be harmed by extraction operations or infrastructure development. 8. Long-term economic stability: Transitioning away from fossil fuels can spur the growth of renewable energy industries, creating new job opportunities and fostering economic stability in the long run. Additional negative arguments: 5. National security implications: Restricting fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters can hinder the country's energy self-sufficiency and make it more vulnerable to disruptions in global energy markets or political disputes with energy-exporting countries. 6. Trade implications: Prohibiting fossil fuel extraction could lead to a loss of international competitiveness in the energy sector, potentially impacting trade relationships and economic growth. 7. Transition challenges: Completely prohibiting extraction without comprehensive alternative energy infrastructure in place could lead to energy shortages, blackouts, and instability in the short term. 8. Technological advancements and emissions reduction: Allowing fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters provides the opportunity for technological advancements that can improve extraction practices, reduce emissions, and lessen environmental impacts, assisting with the transition to cleaner energy sources.

Сумма поставок предприятию Д = 1300 тыс. руб. * 11 месяцев + 1300 тыс. руб. * 45% = 14 950 тыс. руб. + 585 тыс. руб. = 15 535 тыс. руб.

Таким образом, прибыль компании импортера составляет 26 135 тыс. руб. Средние издержки представляют собой отношение общих затрат к общему выпуску. В данном случае общий выпуск равен общей выручке, поэтому средние издержки можно рассчитать следующим образом: Средние издержки = Затраты / Общая выручка Средние издержки = 58 800 тыс. руб. / 84 935 тыс. руб. = 0.6918 Таким образом, средние издержки компании импортера равны 0.6918 или 69.18%."},{"instruction":"Explique-moi la bonté originelle chez Rousseau","output":"La bonté originelle selon Rousseau est le concept selon lequel les êtres humains naissent essentiellement bons et bienveillants. Selon Rousseau, l'homme, avant la société, vivait dans un état de nature où il était libre et heureux. Dans cet état, les individus étaient naturellement portés à la compassion, à l'amour et à la générosité envers leurs semblables. Rousseau soutient que c'est l'émergence de la société civilisée qui corrompt la bonté originelle de l'homme. L'introduction de la propriété privée, des lois et des institutions sociales a conduit à des inégalités et à une compétition destructrice entre les individus, ce qui a conduit à la corruption de l'état de nature. Rousseau critique profondément les institutions sociales qui perpétuent cette corruption, affirmant que l'inégalité sociale est à l'origine de nombreux maux de l'humanité, tels que la violence, l'envie et la rivalité. Il soutient que pour retrouver la bonté originelle, il est nécessaire de revenir à un état plus primitif et égalitaire, où les individus vivraient en harmonie les uns avec les autres. En résumé, la bonté originelle chez Rousseau est le concept selon lequel les êtres humains sont naturellement bons, mais que cette bonté est corrompue par la société civilisée. Rousseau critique la société pour avoir éloigné l'homme de cet état de bonté, et propose de revenir à un état plus primitif et égalitaire pour retrouver cette bonté originelle."},{"instruction":"请想出几个新闻传播学的毕业论文题目","output":"1. 社交媒体与新闻传播：传统媒体面临的挑战与应对策略研究 2. 新闻传播学视角下的虚假信息传播与对策调查研究 3. 移动互联网时代的新闻传播模式探析 4. 网络新媒体时代下的公众舆论监管研究 5. 新闻传播学角度下的媒体与政府关系调查与分析 6. 社交媒体对新闻价值评判的影响研究 7. 媒体融合背景下的新闻传播战略与实践研究 8. 新闻传播学视角下的跨文化传播研究 9. 全球化时代下的国际新闻传播现象分析与研究 10. 新闻传播学视角下的用户生成内容对传媒格局的影响研究"},{"instruction":"What is organizational knowledge management?","output":"Organizational knowledge management refers to the systematic collection, creation, storage, transfer, and application of knowledge within an organization.

She had long, golden locks that shimmered like the sun and eyes as radiant as the moon. Amelia was known throughout the town for her kind heart and gentle soul. But behind her innocent appearance, Amelia possessed a secret – she had the ability to bring life to inanimate objects with just a flick of her wrist. It was a gift passed down through generations in her family, a power she had yet to fully understand. One sunny morning, as Amelia skipped through a meadow, she stumbled upon a forgotten garden. Surrounded by a crumbling stone wall, the garden was draped in a shroud of silence. Weeds choked the once vibrant flowers, and the ornate fountain stood with its pool of stagnant water. Touched by the melancholy of the neglected garden, Amelia felt an urge to revive its beauty. She closed her eyes and stretched out her delicate hand, focusing all her energy on the lifeless fountain. A soft whisper escaped her lips, mingling with the gentle breeze. Within moments, the statue of a mermaid, frozen in stone, began to stir. Spirals of water danced around her tail, livening the once-dull sculpture. Her exquisite features came alive, and she smiled at Amelia with gratitude. Overjoyed at her success, Amelia continued on her mission of resurrection. With each touch, every petal breathed in new life, bursting into a kaleidoscope of colors. The vines that had strangled the garden’s paths retreated, guided by her magic fingertips, to create a picturesque labyrinth. Birds flocked to the trees, chirping melodiously, while butterflies emerged from their cocoons, fluttering through the air like confetti. News of the enchanted garden spread quickly, and visitors from far and wide came to witness Amelia’s extraordinary talents. They marveled at the garden’s transformation, whispering tales of a young girl with the power to awaken life from within. On one particularly eventful day, as the garden thrived with renewed energy, a peculiar traveler arrived. His dark cloak and cryptic aura suggested a hidden purpose. He approached Amelia, his eyes filled with curiosity and a hint of greed. \\"Little enchantress, your gift is a treasure beyond measure,\\" he said, his voice like velvet. \\"Give it to me, and I shall make you queen of all realms.\\" Amelia’s heart wavered, tempted by the grandeur of his offer. But she knew deep down that her power was not something to be squandered. It was meant to bring joy and beauty into the world; it was her purpose, her responsibility. Declining the traveler’s proposal, Amelia resumed her duty of nurturing the garden. The flowers bloomed brighter, and even the stones seemed to hum with delight. The traveler, disappointed but intrigued, observed her from a distance, unable to comprehend her selflessness. As the sun began to set, turning the sky into a canvas of vibrant colors, the traveler vanished into thin air, leaving behind a swirl of black mist. Amelia sensed a weight lifted from her shoulders, a presence banished that threatened to dim her light. Years passed, and the garden continued to flourish under Amelia’s care. But the townspeople noticed an extraordinary change in their beloved enchantress. Her golden locks had turned silver, and her eyes carried the wisdom of ages. One fateful day, as autumn leaves painted the ground in shades of amber, Amelia gathered the townspeople in the garden. Her voice echoed through the now-majestic trees, as she confessed her desire to share her gift with others. \\"I have realized that my purpose is not to confine my magic to this garden, but to ignite it within all those who have lost hope,\\" she declared. And so, Amelia imparted her powers to the townspeople, inspiring them to become masters of their own destinies. The garden became a sanctuary of rejuvenation, spreading its magic far beyond borders, bringing light and life to the world. And that is how the story of Amelia, the enchantress with a heart as pure as her golden locks, forever whispered in the hearts of those touched by her magic. For her selflessness became a guidepost, reminding them that true power lies not in the possession of gifts, but in their humble use for the greater good."},{"instruction":"Не повторяйте то, что уже было написано ранее.

Выручку от продажи товаров можно рассчитать как сумму поставок товарам каждому предприятию за год: Выручка = (1500 + 1100 + 1300 + 950) * 2 = 9700 тыс. руб. Общие издержки компании состоят из постоянных и переменных затрат. Постоянные затраты составляют 32240 тыс. руб. в год, а переменные затраты - 48400 тыс. руб. в год.

Теперь мы можем рассчитать прибыль компании импортера: Прибыль = Выручка - Общие издержки = 9700 - 80640 = -70940 тыс. руб. Здесь мы получаем отрицательное значение прибыли, что означает, что компания импортер понесла убытки. Средние издержки можно определить, разделив общие издержки на объем продаж: Средние издержки = Общие издержки / Выручка = 80640 / 9700 = 8.32 тыс. руб. Предельные затраты - это изменение общих затрат при увеличении объема производства на одну единицу.

Introduction of the oligoHis tag at the GlmNagB C-terminus resulted in almost complete loss of the catalytic activity, while the catalytic properties of GlmNagB-HisN and GlmNagB were very similar. The recombinant and wild-type enzyme exhibits heterogeneity of the quaternary structure and in solution exists in three interconvertible forms, namely, monomeric, homodimeric, and homotetrameric. Although the monomeric form is prevalent, the monomer/dimer/tetramer ratios depended on protein concentration and fell within the range from 72:27:1 to 39:23:38. The enzyme is fully active in each of the oligomeric structures, efficiently catalyzes synthesis of D-glucosamine-6-phosphate from D-fructose-6-phosphate and ammonia, and its activity is not modified by GlcNAc6P, UDPGlcNAc, or UDP-GalNAc.

Selection: Ripe and fresh strawberries are chosen for drying. They should be free from any bruises, mold, or other signs of spoilage. 2. Washing: The strawberries are thoroughly washed to remove any dirt, debris, or pesticides. It is important to handle them gently to avoid damaging the fruit. 3. Preparation: The green stem or hull is typically removed. The strawberries can be sliced or left whole, depending on each individual's preference. 4. Pre-treatment (optional): Some people prefer to pre-treat the strawberries to enhance color retention and prevent them from losing their shape during the drying process. Options for pre-treatment may involve blanching, soaking in lemon juice, or using sulfite solutions. 5. Drying: There are various methods for drying strawberries, including air drying, oven drying, sun drying, and using food dehydrators. The method chosen will depend on the available resources and personal preference. - Air drying: This method involves placing the sliced strawberries on a tray, wire rack, or mesh screen, and allowing them to dry naturally in a well-ventilated area. It can take several days for the strawberries to fully dry using this method. - Oven drying: Preheating the oven to a low temperature (around 140-160°F or 60-70°C) and spreading the strawberries in a single layer on a baking sheet. The oven door is propped open slightly to allow moisture to escape. The strawberries are dried in the oven for several hours, and the duration can vary depending on size, thickness, and desired moisture content. - Sun drying: In dry and warm climates, strawberries can be left in direct sunlight to dry. This method is more time-consuming and weather-dependent. - Food dehydrator: Food dehydrators offer a convenient and controlled method for drying strawberries. The prepared strawberries are placed on the drying trays, and the machine circulates warm air to dry them more efficiently. The optimal temperature and duration for drying can vary depending on the dehydrator model and manufacturer's instructions. 6. Checking for doneness: The drying process is complete when the strawberries are leathery or crispy to the touch. They should no longer be sticky or have any moisture content, as this can lead to spoilage during storage. 7. Conditioning (optional): Conditioning is recommended to equalize the moisture content in the dried strawberries and ensure that they are evenly dried. This involves placing them in airtight containers or jars for about a week, shaking them daily to redistribute any remaining moisture. If any condensation occurs, further drying is required. 8. Storage: Once completely dried, the strawberries are stored in airtight containers or sealed bags in a cool, dark, and dry place to maintain their quality. Stored properly, dried strawberries can last for several months."},{"instruction":"traduza o texto completo e perfeitamente para o português THE FELICITY OF COMING TO THE HELP OF MOMINS It is narrated from Mufazzal bin Omer that Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) said, “O Mufazzil! Listen to what I say and act on the advice! Inform your pious momin brothers too of what I am saying.” Mufazzil asked, “Ya Hazrat! I offer myself in sacrifice for you! Who are the people who take pleasure in helping their brother momins?” The Imam (a.s) replied, “When a person helps fulfill one need of a momin, Allah will fulfill his hundred thousand needs in the Hereafter. One of his wishes will be taking his next of kin, friends and relations to the Heaven. The only condition required of him will be that the persons on whose behalf he intercedes have not been hypocrites (Nasibi).” It is narrated in another tradition that Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) told to Mufazzil, “O Mufazzil! Allah has selected one group from His creatures who attend to the needs of our poor Shias. In return for this Allah will award Heaven to them. Therefore, to the best of your ability help them.and become a part of the chosen group!” It is narrated from Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) when a momin approaches him for help, and he thinks that the person coming to him is a matter of felicity, and helps him suitably, it will be the cause of our friendship for him. Our friendship is Allah’s friendship. And if he turns down the request of the momin for help, despite having the means to do it, Allah will put a fiery snake in his grave. This snake will trouble him till the Day of Judgement.Later on, it will be Allah’s decision either to punish him or reward him. It is narrated from Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) that in his view helping meet the needs of a momin is better than performing twenty Haj pilgrimages when on each pilgrimage one has spent a hundred thousand Dirhams. Imam Mohammed Baqir (a.s) has said: If a momin finds another in trouble, desires to help him, but is not in a position to come to his aid, Allah will award Heaven to such a person. Imam Mohammed Baqir (a.s) said that if a person himself takes the trouble of going to help a brother momin, then seventy five thousand angels would provide the shadow of their wings over his head and for every step that he takes for this purpose, Allah will add one good to the account of his deeds and pardons all his sins. Allah will also raise the person’s status by a degree. When the person returns after performing the good deed, the reward for performing a Haj and Umra is entered in his record. 439The Prophet of Allah (a.s) has said: When a person doesn’t come to the aid of a momin, despite having the means of doing it, then Allah will demean him in this world and the hereafter. Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) says: There are four types of persons on whom Allah will Bestow Blessing on the Day of Reckoning: 1. One from whom someone bought something, but returned it and the person has willingly accepted back his merchandise. 2. One who comes to the rescue of a person in trouble. 3. One who frees a slave. 4. One who extends a helping hand for the marriage of a poor person. Hazrat Ameer al Momineen (a.s) has said, “A person who removes the danger of fire, flood or the enemy from Muslims, Allah will pardon all his sins” Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) says, “One person was brought back to life from the grave by angels and told him,’ We shall inflict on you a thousand blows of the whip of Allah’s Punishment!’ The person said, ‘I don’t have the strength to bear so much flogging.’ The angels said, ‘All right! We shall reduce one blow!’ He said, ‘I don’t have the strength to bear this severe punishment.’ In this way the angels kept reducing the number of blows they wanted to give the person and he kept on peading that he didn’t have sufficient strength to bear the flogging. In the end the angels said, ‘Atleast, we shall flog you once!’ the man asked, ‘You have not told me for what fault of mine you want to punish me?’ The angels said,’ Once you had prayed without doing the mandatory ablution and on another occasion you passed by an old man who needed help, but you didn’t help him.’ Saying this the angels flogged him once, The blow was so intense that a small fire started in the grave.” It is narrated from the Prophet of Allah (a.s) that whosoever denies to fulfill the need of a needy person, despite having the means to help him, his sin will be like the sin of Ashari. Someone asked, ‘Who is Ashari?’ The Prophet said, “A sinner who is cursed by Allah, the angels and all the creatures every day and night. One who is accursed of Allah, can be helped by none.” Also the Prophet (a.s) said, “One who hides one fault of a momin, Allah will overlook his seventy faults in the Hereafter.” The Prophet (a.s) said that Allah will not Reward one who embezelled. Someone asked, ‘Who is an embezeller?’ The Prophet (a.s) said, “He is one who is miserly in helping a brother momin.” 440CENSURING, BELITTLING OR HARMING THE MOMINS It is narrated from Imam Reza (a.s) that there were four pious persons (momins) during the period of the bani Israel. Three of them were one day having a tete a tete when the fourth knocked at the door. The slave of the house came out. The momin asked him if his lord was at home. When the slave replied in the negative, the momin went away. The master asked the slave of the identity of the caller. The slave replied that it was so-and-so and that he had told him that the master wasn’t home. The master and the other two momins did not object to the slave’s act. The next day the momin visited the place when the three of them were emerging from the house. He greeted them and said that he visited the place the previous day too. The three of them laughed and didn’t even express regrets for not being able to meet him. They then proceeded towards their farm. On the way a cloud hovered over the heads of the three persons. The angel Jibraeel called,’ O lightening of the cloud! Fall on the heads of the three persons and render them to ashes!’ Lightening emerged from the cloud and burnt them to ashes. The fourth momin expressed deep sorrow and anguish for the tragedy that had befallen their friends. He went to the prophet (a.s) of those times, Hazrat Yusha (a.s) and narrated the happening to him. He said that ‘Allah dislikes one momin belittling and making a laughing stock of another. Your three friends did that to you. You visited them the frst day, they were at home and their slave had lied to you that they were not at home. They silently approved of what the slave did. On your second visit they didn’t express any regret for the inconvenience caused to you. To the contrary, they belittled by laughing at you! You were not aware of their intentions, but Allah knows everything and He didn’t like their behavior. They have been punished for their misbehavior!’ The momin said, ‘O prophet of Allah! I have pardoned my friends!’ Hazrat Yusha (a.s) replied,’ There is scope for pardon only before the arrival of Allah’s Retribution! But there is no possibility of pardon after the Retribution has visited the sinners! It is possible that your friends may not be asked to account for this misdeed of theirs.’","output":"É narrado por Mufazzal bin Omer que o Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) disse: \\"Ó Mufazzil! Ouça o que eu digo e siga o conselho! Informe também seus irmãos piedosos momins sobre o que estou dizendo\\". Mufazzil perguntou: \\"Ó Hazrat! Eu me ofereço em sacrifício por você! Quem são as pessoas que sentem prazer em ajudar seus irmãos momins?\\" O Imam (a.s) respondeu: \\"Quando alguém ajuda a satisfazer uma necessidade de um momin, Allah satisfará suas cem mil necessidades no Além. Um de seus desejos será levar seus parentes, amigos e relações para o Paraíso. A única condição exigida dele será que as pessoas em nome das quais ele intercede não tenham sido hipócritas (Nasibi)\\". É narrado em outra tradição que Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) disse a Mufazzil: \\"Ó Mufazzil! Allah selecionou um grupo de suas criaturas que atendem às necessidades de nossos pobres Shias. Em troca disso, Allah os recompensará com o Paraíso. Portanto, ajude-os da melhor maneira possível e faça parte do grupo escolhido!\\" É narrado do Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) que, quando um momin se aproxima dele em busca de ajuda, e ele pensa que a pessoa que o procura é uma questão de felicidade, e a ajuda de forma adequada, isso será a causa de nossa amizade por ele. Nossa amizade é a amizade de Allah. E se ele recusar o pedido de ajuda do momin, apesar de ter meios para fazê-lo, Allah colocará uma serpente ardente em sua sepultura. Essa serpente o incomodará até o Dia do Juízo. Depois, será decisão de Allah puni-lo ou recompensá-lo. É narrado do Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) que, em sua opinião, ajudar a atender às necessidades de um momin é melhor do que realizar vinte peregrinações Hajj, em cada uma das quais se gastou cem mil Dirhams. O Imam Mohammed Baqir (a.s) disse: Se um momin encontra outro em apuros, deseja ajudá-lo, mas não está em condições de ajudá-lo, Allah recompensará esse pessoa com o Paraíso. O Imam Mohammed Baqir (a.s) disse que se uma pessoa se esforça para ajudar um irmão momin, então setenta e cinco mil anjos fornecerão a sombra de suas asas sobre sua cabeça e, para cada passo que ele der com esse propósito, Allah adicionará um bem à conta de suas ações e perdoará todos os seus pecados. Allah também elevará o status da pessoa em um grau. Quando a pessoa retorna depois de realizar a boa ação, a recompensa por realizar um Hajj e uma Umra é registrada em seu histórico. O Profeta de Allah (a.s) disse: Quando uma pessoa não vem em auxílio de um momin, apesar de ter meios para fazê-lo, então Allah o humilhará neste mundo e no Além. O Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) diz: Existem quatro tipos de pessoas sobre as quais Allah derramará bênçãos no Dia do Juízo Final: 1. Aquele de quem alguém comprou algo, mas devolveu e a pessoa aceitou voluntariamente sua mercadoria de volta. 2. Aquele que vem ao resgate de uma pessoa em apuros. 3. Aquele que liberta um escravo. 4. Aquele que estende a mão para ajudar no casamento de uma pessoa pobre. Hazrat Ameer al Momineen (a.s) disse: \\"Uma pessoa que remove o perigo de fogo, enchente ou do inimigo dos muçulmanos, Allah perdoará todos os seus pecados\\". O Imam Jafar e Sadiq (a.s) diz: \\"Uma pessoa foi trazida de volta à vida do túmulo por anjos e lhe disseram: 'Infligiremos a você mil golpes do chicote do Castigo de Allah!'\\" A pessoa disse: 'Não tenho forças para suportar tantas chicotadas.' Os anjos disseram: 'Certo! Reduziremos um golpe!' Ele disse: 'Não tenho forças para suportar esse castigo severo.' Dessa forma, os anjos continuaram reduzindo o número de golpes que queriam dar à pessoa e ele continuou a implorar que não conseguia suportar as chicotadas. No final, os anjos disseram: 'Pelo menos, nós iremos açoitá-lo uma vez!' O homem perguntou: 'Você não me disse por qual culpa eles querem me punir?' Os anjos disseram: 'Uma vez você orou sem fazer a abluição obrigatória e em outra ocasião passou por um idoso que precisava de ajuda, mas você não ajudou'. Dizendo isso, os anjos o açoitaram uma vez. O golpe foi tão intenso que um pequeno fogo começou no túmulo\\". É narrado pelo Profeta de Allah (a.s) que quem se recusa a satisfazer a necessidade de uma pessoa necessitada, apesar de ter os meios para ajudá-la, seu pecado será como o pecado de Ashari. Alguém perguntou: 'Quem é Ashari?' O Profeta disse: \\"Um pecador que é amaldiçoado por Allah, pelos anjos e por todas as criaturas todos os dias e noites. Aquele que é amaldiçoado por Allah não pode ser ajudado por ninguém\\". Também o Profeta (a.s) disse: \\"Quem esconde um defeito de um momin, Allah perdoará setenta defeitos dele no Além\\". O Profeta (a.s) disse que Allah não recompensará aquele que se apropriar indevidamente. Alguém perguntou: 'Quem é um apropriador indevido?' O Profeta (a.s) disse: \\"Ele é aquele que é avarento em ajudar um irmão momin\\". CRITICAR, DIMINUIR OU PREJUDICAR OS MOMINS É narrado do Imam Reza (a.s) que havia quatro pessoas piedosas (momens) durante o período dos bani Israel. Três deles estavam conversando quando o quarto bateu à porta. O escravo da casa saiu. O momin perguntou a ele se seu senhor estava em casa. Quando o escravo respondeu negativamente, o momin foi embora. O mestre perguntou ao escravo sobre a identidade do visitante. O escravo respondeu que era fulano e que havia dito a ele que o mestre não estava em casa. O mestre e os outros dois momins não se opuseram ao ato do escravo. No dia seguinte, o momin visitou o local quando os três estavam saindo da casa. Ele os cumprimentou e disse que tinha visitado o local no dia anterior também. Os três riram e nem mesmo expressaram arrependimento por não terem conseguido encontrá-lo. Em seguida, eles seguiram em direção à sua fazenda. No caminho, uma nuvem pairou sobre as cabeças das três pessoas. O anjo Jibrail chamou: 'Ó relâmpago da nuvem! Caia nas cabeças das três pessoas e as reduza a cinzas!' Um raio saiu da nuvem e as queimou até as cinzas. O quarto momin expressou profunda tristeza e angústia pela tragédia que havia acontecido com seus amigos. Ele foi ao profeta (a.s) daquela época, Hazrat Yusha (a.s), e narrou o acontecimento para ele. Ele disse que 'Allah não gosta que um momin diminua e ridicularize outro. Seus três amigos fizeram isso com você. Você os visitou no primeiro dia, eles estavam em casa e o escravo mentiu para você, dizendo que eles não estavam em casa. Eles aprovaram silenciosamente o que o escravo fez. Em sua segunda visita, eles não expressaram nenhum arrependimento pelo inconveniente causado a você. Pelo contrário, eles diminuíram ao rirem de você! Você não estava ciente de suas intenções, mas Allah conhece tudo e Ele não gostou de seu comportamento. Eles foram punidos por sua má conduta!' O momin disse: 'Ó profeta de Allah! Eu perdoei meus amigos!' Hazrat Yusha (a.s) respondeu: 'Existe espaço para perdão apenas antes da chegada do Retribuição de Allah! Mas não há possibilidade de perdão depois que a Retribuição visitou os pecadores! É possível que seus amigos não sejam solicitados a prestar contas por esta má ação deles'."},{"instruction":"Co napisać dziewczynie po napisaniu wiadomości na FB po akceptacji jej zaproszenia i napisaniu co u niej słychać:","output":"Cześć [imię dziewczyny]!

Familiarize yourself with the data: Start by getting acquainted with the qualitative data you have collected, such as interviews, focus group discussions, or observations. Read through the data to familiarize yourself with the content and gain an understanding of the main themes and concepts. 2. Begin coding: Open coding involves breaking down the qualitative data into smaller, meaningful segments. Start by reading through the data and identifying individual concepts, ideas, or phrases that stand out to you. Highlight or underline these segments to mark them for coding. 3. Create categories: Review the highlighted segments and group them into different categories based on their similarities. These categories should emerge organically from the data rather than being pre-determined. You can create categories based on themes, sub-themes, or any other meaningful divisions within the data. 4. Assign codes: Assign a code to each segment of data within each category. A code is a descriptive word or phrase that captures the essence of the information contained in a segment. For example, if a participant talks about their experience with exercise, you might assign the code \\"exercise\\" to that segment. 5. Develop a coding system: Create a coding system to organize your codes and keep track of how they relate to each other. This could be in the form of a spreadsheet, a coding tree, or any other organizational structure that works for you. Ensure the coding system is well-documented and provides a clear understanding of the associations between different codes. 6. Analyze the coded data: Once you have coded the entire qualitative data set, review and analyze the coded segments within each category. Look for patterns, connections, or recurring themes that emerge across categories. This process may involve comparing and contrasting the codes, identifying relationships, and making connections between different segments of the data. 7. Iterate and refine: It is common for coding to be an iterative process. As you delve deeper into the data analysis, you may need to revise or refine your codes and categories to better capture the nuances and complexities of the data. Continuously review and refine your coding system to ensure it remains accurate and comprehensive. 8. Interpret and generate insights: After completing the coding process, interpret the coded data to generate insights and identify key findings. Analyze the connections and patterns between the codes, draw conclusions, and develop meaningful interpretations based on the qualitative data. Remember that open coding is just one step in the qualitative data analysis process. Further analysis, such as axial coding and selective coding, may be necessary for a complete understanding of the data."},{"instruction":"Tableau de spécifications des interactions entre les fonctionnalités et les acteurs pour une gestion de frais scolaires","output":"Acteur: Élève | Fonctionnalités | Acteur: Élève | | ------------- |:-------------:| | S'inscrire | x | | Consulter les frais scolaires | x | | Payer les frais scolaires | x | | Télécharger les reçus de paiement | x | | Voir les dates limites de paiement | x | Acteur: Parent | Fonctionnalités | Acteur: Parent | | ------------- |:-------------:| | S'inscrire | x | | Consulter les frais scolaires | x | | Payer les frais scolaires | x | | Télécharger les reçus de paiement | x | | Voir les dates limites de paiement | x | | Ajouter un nouvel élève | x | | Gérer les informations de l'élève | x | Acteur: Enseignant | Fonctionnalités | Acteur: Enseignant | | ------------- |:-------------:| | S'inscrire | x | | Consulter les frais scolaires des élèves | x | | Voir les reçus de paiement des élèves | x | | Voir les élèves en situation d'impayé | x | Acteur: Administrateur | Fonctionnalités | Acteur: Administrateur | | ------------- |:-------------:| | S'inscrire | x | | Consulter les frais scolaires de tous les élèves | x | | Voir les reçus de paiement de tous les élèves | x | | Créer et gérer les dates limites de paiement | x | | Gérer les informations des utilisateurs | x |"},{"instruction":"1.

Help me.","output":"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling regret about resigning from your job. Here are a few steps you can take to help navigate this situation: 1. Reflect on your decision: Take some time to reflect on why you resigned in the first place. Was it due to work-related issues, personal reasons, or other circumstances? Consider whether those factors have changed or if you are simply experiencing temporary emotions. 2. Evaluate your options: Assess whether it's possible to reverse your resignation. Reach out to your former employer or supervisor to discuss the possibility of returning or exploring alternative options, if you still wish to do so. 3. Show genuine remorse: If you have a sincere desire to return, communicate your regret and apologize for any inconvenience caused by your resignation. Express your willingness to make amends and contribute positively to the company if given the opportunity. 4. Be prepared for different outcomes: Understand that your employer may have already started the process of finding a replacement or moved forward with changes. Therefore, it's crucial to be prepared for the possibility that your employer may not be able to accommodate your return. 5. Explore new opportunities: If returning to your previous job is not feasible, use this chance to explore new possibilities. Update your resume, start networking, or consider searching for new job opportunities that align with your long-term goals and interests. 6. Learn from the experience: Regardless of the outcome, take this situation as a valuable learning experience. Reflect on why you felt regret and consider how you can approach future decisions more thoughtfully. It's important to make sure you are making choices based on careful consideration and analysis. Remember, it's normal to have second thoughts about major decisions.

В данной задаче срок полезного использования составляет 10 лет, поэтому R = 0 (стоимость группы объектов станет равной 0 после 10 лет).

The word «muscle», according to one theory, comes from a Latin word that means «little mouse»: that is, when a man's muscles are contracting they look as if a little mouse runs about under his skin. According to another theory the word «muscle» comes from a Greek expression that means «to enclose», that is, layers of muscles enclose the body. We know that the muscles constitute approximately 50 per cent of the total body weight, slightly more in the average male than the female. Tendons, fasciae and the various organs themselves depend on the muscular system and the function of muscle cells. 2. There are three main types of muscular tissue that we identify and classify on the basis of structure and functions: 1) smooth or visceral muscle, 2) striated or skeletal muscle, 3) cardiac muscle. 3. Smooth muscles can contract slowly. They make up the walls of the internal organs such as those of the blood vessels, and the digestive tract. Since we identify the internal organs as viscera, we sometimes call smooth muscles visceral muscles. The visceral muscles react relatively slowly to changes within the body and do so without the intervention of the will. The walls of the blood vessels are contracting or expanding when they respond to certain chemicals in the blood or in response to the effect of temperature but we cannot deliberately cause them to lift our arm or open our mouth. For this reason, we may call them involuntary muscles. Smooth muscle tissue consists of long cells. Smooth muscle fibres are bound (связаны) into bundles by connective tissue which contain blood vessels and nerves. 4. Striated muscle tissue consists of large fibres in the form of bundles. Striated muscles are most necessary for manipulation of the bones of the skeleton. Those are the muscles necessary for walking, running, turning the head and so on. That's why we sometimes call them skeletal muscles. This type of muscle tissue includes the large muscle masses of the body, the muscles of the arms, legs, back etc.1 It includes all those muscles which must react quickly to changes in the environment, i.e.2 those that become active through an effort of will. For this reason, we call striated muscles voluntary muscles. 5. Cardiac (heart) muscle is, in a sense, a cross between the previous two. A characteristic feature of cardiac muscle is that fibres have neither a beginning nor an end. In other words, the heart is simply a huge net of muscles in which all elements are continuous with each other. Cardiac muscles («heart» - Greek) have the strength and force of contraction of the skeletal muscle. Cardiac muscle is under complete involuntary control. In that, it resembles visceral muscle.","output":"Перевод этого текста на русский язык: 1. Слово «мышца», согласно одной теории, происходит от латинского слова, которое означает «маленькая мышь»: то есть, когда мышцы человека сокращаются, они выглядят так, как будто маленькая мышь бегает под его кожей. Согласно другой теории, слово «мышца» происходит от греческого выражения, которое означает «окружать», то есть слои мышц окружают тело. Мы знаем, что мышцы составляют примерно 50 процентов от общей массы тела, немного больше у мужчин, чем у женщин. Сухожилия, фасции и сами органы зависят от мышечной системы и функции мышечных клеток. 2. Есть три основных типа мышечной ткани, которые мы определяем и классифицируем на основе структуры и функций: 1) гладкая или внутренняя мышца, 2) полосатая или скелетная мышца, 3) сердечная мышца. 3. Гладкие мышцы могут медленно сокращаться. Они составляют стенки внутренних органов, таких как сосуды и пищеварительный тракт. Поскольку мы идентифицируем внутренние органы как внутренние, мы иногда называем гладкие мышцы вискеральными мышцами. Внутренние мышцы реагируют относительно медленно на изменения в организме и делают это без вмешательства воли. Стенки кровеносных сосудов сокращаются или расширяются, когда они реагируют на определенные химические вещества в крови или в ответ на воздействие температуры, но мы не можем намеренно заставить их поднять руку или открыть рот. По этой причине мы можем называть их непроизвольными мышцами. Гладкая мышечная ткань состоит из длинных клеток. Гладкие мышечные волокна связаны пучками соединительной тканью, в которых содержатся кровеносные сосуды и нервы. 4. Полосатая мышечная ткань состоит из больших волокон в виде пучков. Полосатые мышцы наиболее необходимы для обработки костей скелета. Это мышцы, необходимые для ходьбы, бега, поворота головы и так далее. Поэтому мы иногда называем их скелетными мышцами. Этот тип мышечной ткани включает в себя большие массы мышц тела, мышцы рук, ног, спины и т. Д. Включает в себя все те мышцы, которые должны быстро реагировать на изменения в окружающей среде, то есть те, которые активизируются через усилие воли. По этой причине мы называем полосатые мышцы волевыми мышцами. 5. Кардиальная (сердечная) мышца есть, по сути, скрещение двух предыдущих типов. Характерной особенностью кардиальной мышцы является то, что у волокон нет начала и конца. Другими словами, сердце - это просто огромная сеть мышц, в которой все элементы непрерывно связаны друг с другом.

Желательно с учетом формул из предмета экономики с пояснением и разбором, пожалуйста. Сама задача: Приобретен автомобиль с планируемым пробегом 300 тыс. км стоимостью 600 тыс. руб. В отчетном периоде пробег составил 20 тыс. км. Определить А год способом списания стоимости пропорционально объему произведенной продукции.","output":"Для решения задачи по списанию стоимости автомобиля необходимо знать, какой метод списания будет использоваться. В данном случае, требуется использовать метод списания стоимости пропорционально объему произведенной продукции. Формула для расчета амортизации по методу пропорционального списания выглядит следующим образом: Агод = (С - В) * П / С где: Агод - амортизация за год; С - стоимость автомобиля; В - остаточная стоимость автомобиля на начало года; П - пробег автомобиля за год. В данной задаче нам уже известны следующие данные: С = 600 тыс. руб. (стоимость автомобиля) В = ? (остаточная стоимость автомобиля на начало года) П = 20 тыс. км (пробег автомобиля за год) Так как остаточную стоимость автомобиля на начало года (В) не указана, предположим, что оно составляет 600 тыс. руб. (так как пробег автомобиля составил всего 20 тыс. км и еще не должно сильно сказываться на его стоимости). Теперь можем подставить все значения в формулу: Агод = (600 - 600) * 20 / 300 = 0 руб. Таким образом, амортизация за год составляет 0 рублей. Однако, следует отметить, что в данной задаче нет информации о сроке эксплуатации автомобиля, поэтому предположение о его остаточной стоимости на начало года равной его стоимости не всегда будет верным. Если известна информация о сроке эксплуатации и степени износа автомобиля, можно правильно определить остаточную стоимость на начало года и, соответственно, амортизацию за год."},{"instruction":"Что очень не любят дети","output":"Ответ на этот вопрос может быть субъективным, поскольку предпочтения детей могут отличаться.

Install Whoosh: You can install the \`Whoosh\` library by running \`pip install Whoosh==2.7.4\` in your terminal. 2. Create a Flask application: Create a Flask application by creating a new Python file, importing the necessary modules, and initializing the Flask app. \`\`\`python from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) \`\`\` 3. Set up the database: Set up your database using a suitable database library (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL). In this example, we'll use SQLite. \`\`\`python from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///your_database.db' db = SQLAlchemy(app) \`\`\` 4. Define a model: Create a model class representing the data structure of objects stored in the database. Here's an example model for a \\"Product\\" with fields for the product name and description: \`\`\`python class Product(db.Model): id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False) description = db.Column(db.Text) def __repr__(self): return f\\"<Product {self.name}>\\" \`\`\` 5. Create a Whoosh index: Create an index for the table(s) you wish to search. In this example, we'll create an index for the \\"Product\\" model. \`\`\`python from whoosh import index from whoosh.fields import Schema, TEXT index_dir = 'path_to_index_directory' # Schema for the \\"Product\\" model product_schema = Schema(name=TEXT(stored=True), description=TEXT) if not index.exists_in(index_dir): index.create_in(index_dir, product_schema) \`\`\` 6. Index the database: Index the database's records using Whoosh's indexing capabilities. In Flask, you can do this by defining a route that adds records to the index. \`\`\`python from whoosh.index import open_dir from whoosh.index import create_in from flask import jsonify @app.route('/index') def index(): products = Product.query.all() ix = open_dir(index_dir) # Open the Whoosh index # Create a writer to add documents to the index writer = ix.writer() # Add the product records to the index for product in products: writer.add_document(name=product.name, description=product.description) writer.commit() # Commit changes to the index return jsonify({'message': 'Database indexed successfully'}) \`\`\` 7.

Monogamia are potențialul de a crea o legătură puternică și stabila între parteneri, oferindu-le satisfacție emoțională și sprijin pe termen lung. În plus, monogamia poate fi un factor important în prevenirea răspândirii bolilor cu transmitere sexuală. Limitarea numărului de parteneri reduce riscul de expunere la infecții și promovează practici sexuale sigure și responsabile. De asemenea, principiul monogamiei poate juca un rol crucial în creșterea și educația copiilor. O relație monogamă stabilă oferă un mediu sigur și stabil pentru dezvoltarea copiilor, permițându-le să crească într-un mediu sănătos și iubitor. Cu toate acestea, există și critici și controverse legate de principiul monogamiei. Unii susțin că monogamia poate restricționa libertatea individuală și autonomia sexuală. De asemenea, se argumentează că monogamia poate duce la constrângeri și stagnare în relațiile romantice. În plus, cercetările au arătat că monogamia nu este întotdeauna respectată în practică. Infidelitatea și aventurile extraconjugale sunt și ele prezente în societatea umană. Acestea pot fi considerate un semn al insatisfacției, lipsa de respect sau doar un impuls uman natural. Indiferent de opiniile divergente, principiul monogamiei rămâne un pilon central al multor societăți. Este important de subliniat că fiecare individ și cuplu au libertatea de a alege ce tip de relație consideră potrivită pentru ei, iar monogamia poate fi un principiu valoros pentru mulți oameni. În concluzie, principiul monogamiei este o practică socială care implică angajamentul și fidelitatea față de un singur partener într-o relație romantică sau sexuală. Aceasta poate aduce beneficii precum stabilitatea familială, prevenirea bolilor cu transmitere sexuală și creșterea probabilității de supraviețuire a descendenților, dar poate fi, de asemenea, criticată pentru restrângerea libertății individuale. Indiferent de opțiunea personală, principiul monogamiei reprezintă un aspect important al dinamicii relațiilor umane."},{"instruction":"translate into arbic:\\". Several times, with a sportsman’s pride, he told me how he was able to think ahead of his competitors and turn them into his prey, and how later, in 1929, he had outwitted the entire market, played it against itself and made a fortune out of it. While working with Bevel, I would go through newspapers and books from that period, and they would all confirm and describe, in great detail, most of the financial operations found both in the novel (with some inaccuracies and licenses) and in his firsthand accounts to me (with some whitewashing and self-aggrandizing touch-ups). Not only that: I discovered that both Vanner and Bevel closely paraphrased some of those publications in their narratives. Helen, Benjamin Rask’s wife, was the absolute center of the book to me. I was quick to identify with her. We both had a penchant for loneliness. We both were for the most part friendless. We both had overbearing and dysfunctional fathers, consumed by half-baked dogmas. We both were young women trying to grow in narrow crevices, hoping to break and expand them in the process. And I felt that Vanner, always keeping a respectful distance, understood her—and through her, me. Perhaps because the story had such a personal resonance, I found the last portion of the novel increasingly infuriating with every reading. Why did he have to destroy Helen? Whyabuse her body with such violence in the final moments of her life? And, above all, why make her mad? He had obviously taken all sorts of liberties with Mildred Bevel’s story and could have given her any kind of fate. Why, then, this? Why break her mind? Looking back after all these years, I still remember the main effect of that first encounter with the novel. After reading it, I felt prepared for my first interview with Andrew Bevel. Even more: although it was a work of fiction, the book had convinced me that I was in possession of some essential truth about his life. I was still unable to see just what this truth might be, but this did not prevent me from believing I had, somehow, the upper hand.\\"","output":"عدة مرات ، بفخر رياضي ، كان يخبرني كيف كان قادرًا على التفكير قبل منافسيه وتحويلهم إلى فرائسه ، وكيف تمكن في وقت لاحق ، في عام 1929 ، من استدراج السوق بأكمله ، ولعبها ضد ذاتها ، واستفاد منها. أثناء العمل مع بيبل ، كنت أقوم بمراجعة الصحف والكتب من تلك الفترة ، وكانت تؤكد جميعها وتصف بتفصيل كبير معظم العمليات المالية الموجودة في الرواية (مع بعض عدم الدقة والتراخيص) وفي حساباته المباشرة لي (مع بعض التجميل وتحسين الذات). وليس ذلك فحسب: اكتشفت أن فانر وبيفل قرآنا بعناية بعض هذه النشرات في سردودهما. هيلين ، زوجة بنجامين راسك ، هي المركز المطلق للكتاب بالنسبة لي. كنت سريعة في التعرف معها. لدينا كلاً منا ولع بالوحدة. لدينا كلاً منا معظم الوقت بدون أصدقاء. لدينا كلاً منا آباء عنيدين وغير وظيفيين ، مهموسين بالعقائد غير المباشرة. نحن نتطلع كلاً منا إلى أن نكون امرأتين شابتين تحاولان النمو في الفجوات الضيقة ، على أمل كسرها وتوسيعها في هذه العملية. وشعرت أن فانر ، الذي كان يبقي دائمًا على مسافة محترمة ، يفهمها ، ومن خلالها ، يفهمني. ربما لأن القصة كان لها صدى شخصي بالغ ، وجدت أن الجزء الأخير من الرواية أصبح أكثر استفزازًا مع كل قراءة. لماذا كان عليه أن يدمر هيلين؟ لماذا يعذب جسدها بعنف في اللحظات الأخيرة من حياتها؟ وقبل كل شيء ، لماذا جعلها جنون؟ بالطبع سمح لنفسه بأن يتخذ جميع أنواع الحريات مع قصة ميلدرد بيفل ولكان بإمكانه أن يعطيها أي نوع من المصير. لماذا إذًا ، هذا؟ لماذا كسر عقلها؟ نظرًا للعودة بعد كل هذه السنوات ، لا يزال يتذكر الأثر الرئيسي للقاء الأول مع الرواية. بعد قراءته ، شعرت بأنني مستعد لأول مقابلة مع أندرو بيفل. والأكثر من ذلك: على الرغم من أنها عمل خيال ، إلا أن الكتاب أقنعني بأنني كنت أمتلك بعض الحقيقة الأساسية عن حياته. كنت لا أزال غير قادر على رؤية ما هي هذه الحقيقة بالضبط ، ولكن هذا لم يمنعني من الاعتقاد بأنني بطريقة ما كنت أحمل اليد العليا."},{"instruction":"Ниже предсавлены работы русских социальных мыслителей по проблеме семьи, пола и гендера.

These measures aim to protect sensitive information, such as student and staff data, educational resources, and communication channels, from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Here are some of the key aspects: 1. Organizational Policies and Procedures: - Educational institutions establish and enforce information security policies and procedures that outline the acceptable use of information systems and resources. - These policies define roles and responsibilities, access controls, incident response procedures, and guidelines for data handling. 2. Data Protection Measures: - Institutions implement data protection measures such as encryption, firewalls, secure network architecture, and access controls to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access or data breaches. - They also conduct regular data backups and storage to ensure data availability and recovery in case of any incidents. 3. Training and Awareness: - Educational institutions provide comprehensive training and awareness programs for their staff, students, and other stakeholders to educate them about information security best practices. - These programs cover topics like password hygiene, social engineering awareness, safe internet browsing, and responding to potential security threats. 4. Regulatory Compliance: - Educational institutions are obligated to comply with relevant laws and regulations related to information security and data protection. - For instance, in some countries, institutions must adhere to laws like the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in the United States or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. 5. Incident Response and Management: - Institutions establish incident response plans to effectively address and manage security incidents. - These plans define the procedures for reporting incidents, assessing the impact, containing the situation, and recovering from any potential damage. 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation: - Educational institutions regularly conduct risk assessments to identify potential security vulnerabilities and threats. - Based on the assessment results, appropriate mitigation measures are implemented within their infrastructure and processes to reduce the likelihood and impact of security incidents. 7. Collaboration and Partnerships: - Educational institutions actively collaborate with relevant stakeholders like government agencies, IT security professionals, and industry organizations to exchange insights, best practices, and to collectively address emerging information security challenges.

Here are the steps to play chess: 1. Set up the chessboard: Place the chessboard between two players in such a way that each player has a dark-colored square on the bottom right corner. 2. Place the chess pieces: Each player places their 16 chess pieces on the board. The pawns are placed in a row in front of the other pieces, and the rooks go in the corners. The knights are placed next to the rooks, followed by the bishops, with the queen being placed on the remaining square matching her color. Finally, the king is positioned beside the queen. 3. Understand the moves of each piece: Each chess piece has its own unique way to move. Here is a summary: - King: Can move one square in any direction. - Queen: Can move any number of squares in any direction (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal). - Rook: Moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally. - Bishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally. - Knight: Moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to it). - Pawn: Moves forward one square, and captures diagonally. 4. Start the game: The player controlling the white pieces (usually determined by a coin toss or mutual agreement) moves first. Each player takes turns to make a move. 5. Execute your moves: To play, you will choose one of your own pieces and move it according to its rules. The general aim is to control the center of the board, develop your pieces, protect the king, and create an opportunity to checkmate your opponent. 6. Capture and remove opponent's pieces: If you move a piece to a square occupied by your opponent's piece, you capture that piece, removing it from the board. Remember to announce \\"Capture\\" if applicable. 7. Castle: Castling is a special move that involves the king and one of the rooks. It is done by moving the king two squares towards a rook, then the rook jumps over the king to land on the square next to it. Castling is subject to certain conditions. 8.

Это может быть связано с распределением производства по различным странам, чтобы использовать их компаративные преимущества. 2.

Это включает международные инвестиции, кредитование и эмиссию ценных бумаг. 3. Технологическая глобализация: глобальный обмен технологиями стимулирует инновации и усовершенствования в различных отраслях экономики. Появление интернета и телекоммуникационных технологий обеспечивает мгновенную связь и обмен информацией по всему миру. 4. Трудовая глобализация: иммиграция рабочей силы, как качественная, так и количественная, способствует перемещению труда через границы. Это может быть связано с переездом работников для занятия вакансий в других странах, а также использованием удаленного и контрактного труда. 5.

While there may be a role for government to play in setting reasonable environmental standards and promoting research, the ultimate driving force should be the decisions made by individuals and businesses in a free market. nnGovernment intervention in promoting green technology may lead to inefficiencies, unintended consequences, and the distortion of market dynamics. Instead, we should empower consumers with better information about the environmental impact of products and services, allowing them to make informed choices according to their preferences.
