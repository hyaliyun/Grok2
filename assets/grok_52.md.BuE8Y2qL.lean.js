Here are some key roles of social media in influencing public opinion: 1. Democratization of information: Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to share and access information, giving a voice to the general public. It enables individuals to bypass traditional gatekeepers of news and media, and directly participate in shaping public discourse. 2. Amplification of voices: Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allow users to share their opinions, experiences, and grievances with a wide audience. Through likes, comments, and shares, social media can amplify certain viewpoints, making them more visible and influential. 3.

This immediate exchange of opinions can significantly impact people's views on various topics and influence their overall sentiment. 4. Formation of echo chambers: Social media algorithms often prioritize content based on users' preferences, leading to the formation of echo chambers or filter bubbles. In these echo chambers, users are exposed to information and opinions that align with their beliefs, potentially reinforcing confirmation bias and narrowing their exposure to opposing viewpoints. 5. Mobilization and collective action: Social media platforms have been instrumental in mobilizing and organizing collective action, such as protests, movements, and campaigns, by facilitating communication and coordination among like-minded individuals. Social media can help galvanize public support and create momentum for social and political change. 6. Impact on public discourse: Social media provides a space for public discussions and debates on various issues. It allows individuals to engage in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, leading to a more inclusive public discourse. However, it can also facilitate the spread of misinformation, fake news, and toxic conversations that can hinder constructive dialogues. Overall, social media has become an influential tool in shaping public opinion, as it allows individuals to express their views, create and access information, and engage in dialogue with a global audience. However, it is essential to critically evaluate the information shared on social media platforms and promote responsible usage to ensure a balanced and informed public opinion."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, her motivations within the story are complex and multifaceted, but can essentially be boiled down to her overarching desire to create a world that aligns with her own ideals. **Spoiler warning for those who have not read or are not up-to-date with the \\"Chainsaw Man\\" manga.** Makima is revealed to be the Control Devil, which embodies the fear of control that humans have. Her goal is to create a world void of things she perceives as unnecessary or problematic. She wishes to eliminate concepts such as lies, death, and fear of the unknown by controlling them through her power as a devil. Makima believes that by eradicating these, she will be able to create a more perfect and peaceful society. She has the unique ability to control individuals who are weaker than her and intends to use the Chainsaw Man's power to accomplish her goals. The Chainsaw Man, who is the protagonist of the series named Denji, becomes a particular focus for her because his power can erase devils and the very concept of what they represent from existence, making it possible for her to essentially reset certain aspects of reality. Her plans are detailed and often involve manipulating others, including powerful organizations and the main characters, to get what she wants. However, her vision is very much her own, and she sees herself as a sort of messianic figure capable of reshaping the world according to her design.

If by \\"finding the pi\\" you mean solving or simplifying the expression ( frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} x^2 ), let's proceed with that. The given expression, ( frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} x^2 ), is an algebraic expression where ( x ) is a variable, and ( D ) is another variable or a constant. There is no direct connection to the mathematical constant pi in this expression. To simplify the expression, we can write it as: [ x^2 cdot frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} ] That's essentially as simplified as the expression gets without any additional information about the values of ( x ) or ( D ).

In the context of differential equations, \\"particular integral\\" or PI often refers to a particular solution to the non-homogeneous part of a differential equation. To find a particular integral, one typically identifies a function that, when substituted into the non-homogeneous differential equation, satisfies the equation. However, the expression you provided, ( frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} x^2 ), doesn't immediately suggest a differential equation. Instead, it looks like a term you would encounter when using the operator method to solve a differential equation. In the operator method, ( D ) is often used to denote differentiation with respect to a variable, such as ( x ), so ( D ) operates on functions of ( x ). For example, if we have a differential equation and apply the operator ( D ) to a function ( f(x) ), it would mean taking the derivative of ( f(x) ), i.e., ( Df(x) = frac{df(x)}{dx} ). If the term ( frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} ) comes from attempting to find a particular integral for a differential equation, we'd need the differential equation itself to be explicit. However, if we assume that this is a form derived from such an equation, ( frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} ) might be a part of the method where you find the inverse operator to apply to the non-homogeneous part of the equation. Without the complete differential equation or additional context, it's challenging to provide a definitive particular integral. If you can provide the full differential equation you're working with, including the non-homogeneous part, I can assist you with finding a particular integral (PI) for that specific case."},{"instruction":"find the particular integral of the equation 1/(D-2) ^2 x^2","output":"To find the particular integral (PI) of an ordinary differential equation using the operator method, we need to follow the syntax used within that method. In the operator method, ( D ) symbolizes differentiation with respect to ( x ), so ( Df(x) ) means ( frac{df}{dx} ), and ( D^n f(x) ) means the ( n )-th derivative of ( f(x) ) with respect to ( x ). Given the expression ( frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} x^2 ), it looks like you are trying to solve a differential equation of the form: [ (D - 2)^2 y = x^2 ] In the operator method, to find a particular integral of this equation, you can use the inverse operator represented by ( frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} ) and apply it to the non-homogeneous term, which in this case is ( x^2 ). However, applying the inverse operator directly like this only works if the original differential operator is a function of ( D ) with constant coefficients. Here, ( (D-2)^2 ) represents applying the operator ( D-2 ) twice on ( y(x) ), which means taking the second derivative of ( y(x) ), then subtracting 2 from the result, and doing this process twice. It's important to note that the method to be used depends on a term not being a solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation. In this case, because ( x^2 ) might be a solution to the homogeneous equation ( (D-2)^2 y_h = 0 ), we would need to adjust the method. But in the absence of information suggesting this, we will go through the standard inverse operator approach and demonstrate the use of it. The inverse operator ( frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} ) when applied to ( x^2 ) works in steps. Each step reduces the power of ( D ): First, apply ( frac{1}{D-2} ) to ( x^2 ): [ frac{1}{D-2} x^2 ] Assuming ( x^2 ) is not part of the solution to the homogeneous equation, this operation effectively asks, \\"What function, when differentiated and then reduced by 2, yields ( x^2 )?\\" The answer will be a function whose derivative is ( x^2 + 2 times text{(that function)} ), which can be found using an integrating factor, series expansion, or simply through intelligent guessing. This is not a trivial problem, and may require the use of a tabulated inverse operator if available, or repeated integration by parts, or another method to evaluate. The result, in this case, will be a polynomial of the fourth degree, as each application of the inverse operator will increase the degree of the polynomial by 1. If we perform this operation twice, we will find the particular integral for the given non-homogeneous term ( x^2 ). Let's attempt to find the first application: We are looking for a function ( P_1(x) ) such that: [ D P_1(x) - 2 P_1(x) = x^2 ] Now, this is a first-order inhomogeneous linear ordinary differential equation. Without going into the full solution process, which could get quite complex, we can guess that ( P_1(x) ) might be a polynomial of degree three (since the derivative of a cubic polynomial is a quadratic polynomial). If we were to try a solution of the form ( P_1(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d ), we would differentiate this, subtract 2 times the polynomial, and set it equal to ( x^2 ), attempting to solve for coefficients ( a, b, c, d ). The next step after finding ( P_1(x) ) is to find ( P_2(x) ) such that: [ D P_2(x) - 2 P_2(x) = P_1(x) ] This would give us the particular integral after the second application of the inverse operator. Overall, solving this manually is quite involved. It would be much easier with a differential equation solving software or using a more detailed, systematic approach with integration by parts or series expansions, which might be beyond the scope of what this platform is intended for."},{"instruction":"sove the particular integral of the equation 1/(D-2) ^2 x^2 in detail","output":"Certainly! I will now guide you through the detailed steps to find the particular integral (PI) of the equation using the operator method, given the differential operator: [ left(frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2}right) x^2 ] This suggests that you are working with a differential equation where the differential operator ( (D-2)^2 ) is acting on some function ( y(x) ), and you are looking to solve for ( y(x) ). The non-homogeneous term in this equation is ( x^2 ). Using the given operator, the differential equation would be: [ (D-2)^2 y = x^2 ] To find the PI, we will apply the inverse of ( (D-2)^2 ) to ( x^2 ). The operator ( D ) represents differentiation with respect to ( x ), so ( Dy = frac{dy}{dx} ), and ( D^2y = frac{d^2y}{dx^2} ). Let's start by finding the inverse of the first ( (D-2) ) applied to ( x^2 ): [ frac{1}{D-2} x^2 ] We want to find a function, which we'll call ( g(x) ), that when plugged into the operator ( (D-2) ), will yield ( x^2 ). In other words, we wish to solve: [ (D-2) g(x) = x^2 ] This is equivalent to solving the first-order differential equation: [ frac{dg}{dx} - 2g(x) = x^2 ] To solve this, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor ( mu(x) ) is given by: [ mu(x) = e^{int -2dx} = e^{-2x} ] Multiplying the entire differential equation by the integrating factor yields: [ e^{-2x} frac{dg}{dx} - 2e^{-2x} g(x) = x^2 e^{-2x} ] The left-hand side becomes the derivative of ( g(x) e^{-2x} ): [ frac{d}{dx}[g(x) e^{-2x}] = x^2 e^{-2x} ] Integrating both sides with respect to ( x ), we get: [ g(x) e^{-2x} = int x^2 e^{-2x} dx ] This integral can be solved using integration by parts, applied twice since the power of x is 2. We won't go through the entire process of integration by parts here for brevity's sake, but after performing this process, you'll obtain a formula for ( g(x) ). Once you have ( g(x) ), you will then need to perform a similar operation once more to find the particular integral since you have ( (D-2)^2 ). However, to expedite the process and provide a quick solution, let's make an intelligent guess as the method suggests. A general solution guess for the PI for ( x^2 ) when using the ( (D-2) ) operator might be a polynomial of the form: [ g(x) = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D ] Deriving this gives us: [ frac{d}{dx}(Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D) = 3Ax^2 + 2Bx + C ] Now we have all we need to solve for ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). We put the above into the operator equation: [ (D-2)g(x) = (3Ax^2 + 2Bx + C) - 2(Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D) = x^2 ] This reduces to: [ (3A - 2A)x^2 + (2B - 2B)x + (C - 2C)x - 2D = x^2 ] Simplifying and matching coefficients from both sides, we get: [ A = 0 ] [ 3A - 2B = 1 Rightarrow B = frac{1}{2} ] [ C = 0 ] [ D = 0 ] Now that we have ( B ), our function ( g(x) ) is: [ g(x) = frac{1}{2}x^2 ] For the next step, you would find another function ( h(x) ) such that ( (D-2)h(x) = g(x) ). You would again use an intelligent guess or the method of integrating factors, which could potentially yield a cubic polynomial. However, since we know ( h(x) ) must have a higher degree than ( g(x) ), we can guess a solution of the form: [ h(x) = A'x^4 + B'x^3 + C'x^2 + D'x + E' ] And work through the process as before. In general, this kind of problem could become quite cumbersome to solve exactly by hand, and using tools such as a computer algebra system might be warranted to find an exact solution."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like your last message was empty, but I hope the previous answer was helpful in guiding you on how to solve for the particular integral using the operator method in a situation where the differential equation relates to the expression (frac{1}{{(D-2)}^2} x^2).

This process can be very involved when done manually and often requires guessing a suitable form for the particular integral and then adjusting the coefficients to satisfy the differential equation.

The operator ( D ) symbolizes ( frac{d}{dx} ), the differentiation with respect to ( x ), and ( (D-2)^2 ) suggests we have a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. Our goal is to solve for ( y ) when: [ (D-2)^2 y = x^2 ] Let's decode this in terms of a differential equation: [ D^2 y - 4Dy + 4y = x^2 ] Which translates to the ordinary differential equation (ODE): [ frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - 4frac{dy}{dx} + 4y = x^2 ] To find the particular integral (PI), we need a function ( y_p ) that satisfies the non-homogeneous equation: [ frac{d^2y_p}{dx^2} - 4frac{dy_p}{dx} + 4y_p = x^2 ] Given that the right-hand side is a polynomial of degree 2, the form of the PI should be of similar structure, with the difference that we have to consider the effects of the homogeneous part of the solution, which would yield solutions of the form ( e^{2x} ). To avoid solutions of the homogeneous equation and ensure that ( y_p ) is actually a particular solution, we often have to modify our guess. For a second-degree polynomial on the right-hand side, a good starting guess for ( y_p ) can often be a polynomial of one degree higher, because the operator ( (D-2)^2 ) will reduce the degree once applied. Our guess for ( y_p ) could thus be: [ y_p = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D ] To find ( A, B, C, ), and ( D ), we now apply the operator ( (D - 2)^2 ) to this guess: [ (D - 2)^2 (Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D) = (frac{d^2}{dx^2} - 4frac{d}{dx} + 4)(Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D) ] [ frac{d^2}{dx^2} (Ax^3) = 6Ax ] [ frac{d}{dx} (Ax^3) = 3Ax^2 ] [ -4 frac{d}{dx} (Ax^3) = -12Ax^2 ] So when we apply ( D - 2 ) to ( Ax^3 ), we have: [ (6Ax - 12Ax + 4Ax^3) = 4Ax^3 - 12Ax^2 + 6Ax ] Similarly, we find the derivatives for the rest part of the polynomial and then subtract the necessary terms by applying ( -4D ) and adding ( 4 ) (considering ( D ) as derivative operator). In our case, we find ( A ) is scaled down by a constant coefficient after applying ( (D - 2)^2 ), hence it is not acting as an integrating factor in the solution. Adjusting ( B ) we can cancel out the term arising from ( A ). Once the correct form for ( Ax^3 ) is determined, the rest can be adjusted accordingly. After applying the operator and equating the terms, we solve for ( A, B, C, ), and ( D ). We can then substitute back these coefficients to get our particular integral ( y_p ). In general, this process does involve some trial and error, and as we hinted earlier, sometimes the associated ( A ) term may not be necessary if the action of ( (D - 2)^2 ) does not require it to cancel or scale any terms due to the specific form of the right-hand side function ( x^2 ). Hence, in some cases, ( A ) or other parameters might not be required and could be zero. The final step would require integral calculus and solving a system of equations to find the coefficients. This is beyond the detailed computation scope here, but I hope this explanation guides you through the thought process and the general steps involved in finding the particular integral using the operator method. If you need the exact coefficients, using a computer algebra system or detailed manual calculations will be necessary."},{"instruction":"solve this using binomial therom 1/((D - 2) ^ 2) * x ^ 2","output":"When solving for a particular integral in the context of differential equations using the operator method, the binomial theorem helps to expand expressions of the form ( (1 - x)^n ). Let's use this approach to find the particular solution of a differential equation represented by the operator equation ( frac{1}{(D-2)^2} x^2 ). First, we prepare the inverse operator ( frac{1}{(D-2)^2} ) by using the binomial theorem: [ frac{1}{(1-(D-2))^2} ] Now, we apply the binomial series expansion for ( (1 - (D-2))^{-2} ), which is valid for ( |D-2| < 1 ). This is a formal manipulation since ( D ) is a derivative operator, not a number. We expand the series as: [ (1-(D-2))^{-2} = sum_{k=0}^{infty} binom{-2}{k} (-1)^k (D-2)^k ] [ = sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{(-2)(-3)(-4)...(-2-k+1)}{k!} (D-2)^k ] [ = sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{(k+1)(k)}{2} (D-2)^k ] Now that we have the expansion, we apply each term of the series to ( x^2 ). Since we are applying a \\"power series\\" of operators to ( x^2 ), only a few terms will actually contribute (since applying too high of a derivative to ( x^2 ) will yield zero): For ( k=0 ): [ (D-2)^0 x^2 = x^2 ] For ( k=1 ): [ (D-2)^1 x^2 = (Dx^2 - 2x^2) = (2x - 2x^2) ] For ( k=2 ): [ (D-2)^2 x^2 = D^2x^2 - 4Dx^2 + 4x^2 = 2 - 8x + 4x^2 ] Higher ( k ) values will yield zero when applied to ( x^2 ) since the derivative of a constant is zero. We can now find the particular integral by summing the relevant series terms applied to ( x^2 ): [ PI = sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{(k+1)(k)}{2} (D-2)^k x^2 ] [ PI = frac{(0+1)(0)}{2} x^2 + frac{(1+1)(1)}{2} (2x - 2x^2) + frac{(2+1)(2)}{2} (2 - 8x + 4x^2) ] [ PI = 0 + (1)(2x - 2x^2) + (3)(-4x + 2) ] [ PI = 2x - 2x^2 - 12x + 6 ] [ PI = -2x^2 - 10x + 6 ] Since the operation involves the differential operator ( D ), the above method formally applies the series correctly only if the output does not require infinite series summation due to the fact that higher derivatives of ( x^2 ) disappear. The result obtained using the binomial theorem and summing up the non-vanishing terms is the particular integral of the differential equation. However, this result seems inconsistent with standard practice since typically the series will not terminate after a finite number of terms when applying an operator such as ( (D-2)^2 ) to a function such as ( x^2 ). Usually, the use of the binomial theorem is more theoretically than practically useful in such contexts, and thus it's quite rare to apply in solving differential equations using the operator method. Instead, manual solving with educated guesses or computational tools is generally preferred."},{"instruction":"帮我写一篇独一无二的800字论文 论题为运用矛盾的普遍性和特殊性辩证关系原理，说明中国式现代化的内涵和意义","output":"中国式现代化的内涵和意义 现代化是当今社会追求的目标之一，而中国作为世界上最大的发展中国家，积极推进现代化进程，形成了一种独特的中国式现代化。运用矛盾的普遍性和特殊性辩证关系原理，我们可以探讨中国式现代化的内涵和意义。 首先，要理解中国式现代化的内涵，我们必须了解矛盾的普遍性和特殊性。矛盾的普遍性意味着在人类社会的发展中，存在着各种各样的矛盾。而矛盾的特殊性则表明每个国家和地区都有其独特的矛盾和问题。中国作为一个发展中国家，面临的矛盾和问题与西方发达国家存在明显差异，这就是中国式现代化的独特之处。 中国式现代化的内涵包括了经济、政治、文化等多个方面。在经济方面，中国式现代化意味着实现经济发展与社会稳定的双赢。中国以经济改革和开放为引领，通过引进外资、推进市场化改革等方式，迅速发展起来。与此同时，中国还坚持人民民主专政的政治制度，确保了社会稳定和政权的延续。在文化方面，中国式现代化注重传统文化的保护与发展，倡导中华民族的传统价值观念，并融合西方现代文化的优秀元素。这种独特的文化发展路径，既符合中国传统价值观，又有利于提升国际影响力。 其次，中国式现代化的意义在于满足中国国情和人民需求。中国经历了漫长的历史进程，积累了深厚的文化底蕴和发展经验。中国式现代化既需要吸收借鉴国外现代化经验，又需要根据自身情况进行调整和发展。这种适应性的现代化模式更有利于实现国家的长期稳定与可持续发展。中国式现代化的意义还在于强调人民群众的根本利益和幸福感。中国推进现代化进程，旨在提高人民生活水平、改善社会福利、保障人民权益。只有人民得到实质性的好处，才能真正实现现代化的意义。 最后，中国式现代化的实践也反映出中国的责任与担当。中国作为一个发展中国家，积极参与全球事务，致力于构建人类命运共同体。中国通过“一带一路”倡议，推动亚洲和全球各国的发展与繁荣。中国投身环境保护事业，致力于应对气候变化和生态环境破坏。中国传统哲学中有“天下兴亡，匹夫有责”的观念，中国式现代化不仅仅是为了实现国家的现代化目标，更是为了全人类的共同进步。 综上所述，中国式现代化是一个独特的现代化道路，体现了矛盾的普遍性和特殊性的辩证关系原理。中国式现代化的内涵在于经济、政治、文化等多个方面的发展，其意义在于适应中国国情和人民需求，追求长期稳定和人民的幸福感，并承担起国际责任和担当。中国式现代化的意义不仅仅限于中国境内，更体现了中国所倡导的人类命运共同体的理念。"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki, that was an amazing poem.

Most notable is Daisuke, the third-youngest at 19. While he's an amazing chef, his greatest hunger is that of his hunger for knowledge. A morbid curiosity on the darkness that lies within humanity. He often brings up graphic, disgusting descriptions of violence and cruelty that he had seen on bootleg casset tapes sold by sketchy characters, or read about on the news. In particular, he studies genocides, wars, and serial killings, and is currently documenting a collection of the macabre. Of course, he never condones these atrocities, but he wonders what can bring a man to madness. This is off-putting to most, but isn't to a particular devil hunter, one that is always so calm it's almost creepy. A beautiful redhead with bangs, side bangs, and even a braid in the back. Her golden, concentric eyes are another reason Daisuke remembers her. Makima becomes a frequent patron of this restaurant, and his siblings begin to notice she's a bit unusual. One reports that she had heard a rumor about Makima surviving bullets to the head, or that the devil hunters working under her end up dead, and that because people let their guards down when they are eating, that the restaurant may be targeted by evildoers one day. Makima becomes an object of fear among all but Daisuke, who doesn't fear her. Besides, she called him handsome once. He's also the only one that isn't afraid to wait on her.","output":"Daisuke's morbid curiosity in the darker aspects of human nature could be seen as an intellectual pursuit for understanding the extremes of the human condition, despite being unsettling to those around him. His interest in such grim topics suggests a complexity in his character: a chef, a creator of nourishment and pleasure, juxtaposed with a seeker of humanity's most disturbing truths. The arrival of Makima adds an array of peculiar dynamics to both the restaurant and to Daisuke himself. Her calm demeanor and otherworldly characteristics, such as surviving lethal injuries and the dark rumors surrounding her, make her an enigma. Yet, these same qualities that invoke fear in others seem to draw Daisuke closer to her; this could be due to his fascination with the macabre or simply the allure of her acknowledgement and perhaps, a deeper understanding of him. The apprehension of danger that Makima's presence brings to the restaurant creates an underlying tension. It begs the question of whether her interest is rooted in the food, Daisuke's conversation, or something more sinister. It positions Daisuke at the crossroads of an unspoken conflict, caught between the fear of his siblings and his own intrigue. His willingness to engage with Makima demonstrates a fearlessness or perhaps naivety, resonating with his openness to the horrors of human history. He appears to be someone who doesn't shy away from the abyss, but instead peers into it, seeking to understand its depths. In literary or storytelling contexts, characters like Daisuke and Makima often serve as foils to each other, highlighting their contrasting qualities and furthering the plot through their interactions. Her presence might serve to test Daisuke's limits of fear and morality, or it could lead to a larger narrative involving the restaurant and the dark world Makima potentially represents. It's an intriguing setup for a story, where each character's true motives and nature are waiting to be unveiled, potentially intertwining Daisuke's philosophical inquiries with Makima's mysterious existence."},{"instruction":"","output":"There are many potential ideas for a story, but here is one example: Title: The Forgotten Garden Plot: In a small town called Willow Creek, a mysterious garden emerges overnight.

It is a commonly used technique in molecular biology and biochemistry for separating and analyzing biomolecules based on their size, charge, and/or shape. Here are the main steps involved in electrophoresis: 1. Preparation of a gel matrix: A gel matrix, such as agarose or polyacrylamide, is prepared and poured into a thin rectangular block with wells at one end. The gel acts as a sieve to enable the separation of molecules based on their size or charge. 2. Loading the sample: The sample containing the biomolecules to be separated is mixed with a loading buffer that provides density and color for tracking the progress. The mixture is then added to the wells in the gel. 3. Applying the electric field: The gel block is submerged into an electrophoresis chamber filled with an electrolyte buffer solution. Electrodes are placed at opposite ends of the chamber. Typically, the negatively charged electrode (cathode) is placed at the end where the wells are, and the positively charged electrode (anode) is placed at the opposite end. 4. Electrophoresis process: When the electric current is applied, the negatively charged biomolecules (anions) migrate towards the positive electrode, while the positively charged biomolecules (cations) migrate towards the negative electrode. The gel matrix restricts the movement of larger molecules, causing them to move slowly compared to smaller molecules. 5. Visualization: After a suitable period of time, the electrophoresis process is stopped. The gel is then stained with a reversible dye or exposed to ultraviolet light to detect and visualize the separated molecules. The bands formed on the gel can be documented, quantified, and further analyzed. The separation of biomolecules in electrophoresis can be influenced by various factors, including the strength of the electric field, the composition and concentration of the gel, the size and charge of the biomolecules, and the buffer conditions. By adjusting these factors, electrophoresis can be optimized for specific separation requirements, enabling the analysis of DNA fragments, RNA molecules, or proteins for various applications like genetic profiling, gene expression studies, or protein purification."},{"instruction":"explain native PAGE","output":"Native PAGE (Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) is a technique used to separate proteins based on their size and charge under native conditions. In contrast to denaturing gel electrophoresis, native PAGE does not disrupt the native structure of proteins and allows them to maintain their functional, folded state during separation. Here are the main steps involved in native PAGE: 1. Preparation of the gel: A polyacrylamide gel is prepared by polymerizing acrylamide and bisacrylamide in the presence of a catalyst and a cross-linking agent. The concentration of the gel can be adjusted depending on the size range of proteins to be separated. A stacking gel is often included at the top of the separating gel to concentrate the protein sample before separation. 2. Loading the sample: The protein sample is mixed with a loading buffer that contains a density agent (e.g., glycerol) and a tracking dye. The mixture is then applied to the wells in the gel. 3. Applying the electric field: The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber filled with a buffer that matches the pH and ionic strength of the protein sample. Electrodes are placed at opposite ends of the chamber, and the electric field is applied. The negatively charged electrode (cathode) is placed closest to the wells, while the positively charged electrode (anode) is situated at the opposite end. 4. Migration and separation: When the electric current is applied, the negatively charged proteins migrate towards the positive electrode (anode), while the positively charged proteins move towards the negative electrode (cathode). The proteins migrate through the polyacrylamide gel matrix, with smaller proteins generally moving faster than larger ones. 5. Visualization: After electrophoresis, the gel is either stained with a protein-specific dye, such as Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain, to visualize the protein bands directly. Alternatively, the proteins can be transferred onto a membrane for immunoblotting (Western blotting) to detect specific proteins using antibodies. Native PAGE is particularly useful for studying protein-protein interactions, protein complexes, and for evaluating the purity of protein samples. It provides information about the native size and charge of proteins, which can be valuable for understanding their biological functions and interactions."},{"instruction":"SDS page","output":"SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) is a commonly used technique in molecular biology and biochemistry to separate proteins based on their size. Here are the main steps involved in SDS-PAGE: 1. Preparation of the gel: A polyacrylamide gel is prepared by polymerizing acrylamide and bisacrylamide in the presence of a catalyst and a cross-linking agent, similar to native PAGE. However, in SDS-PAGE, SDS is added to the gel mixture. SDS is a detergent that denatures and unravels proteins, disrupting their native structure. Additionally, a stacking gel is often included at the top of the separating gel to concentrate the protein sample. 2. Loading the sample: The protein sample is mixed with a sample buffer that contains SDS, a reducing agent (such as β-mercaptoethanol or DTT) to break any disulfide bonds, a tracking dye, and a heating step. The mixture is then denatured by heating it to 95-100°C for a few minutes. The denatured proteins are negatively charged due to the binding of SDS, which masks the protein's original charge. The denatured sample is then applied to the wells in the gel. 3. Applying the electric field: The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber filled with a buffer that matches the pH and ionic strength of the protein sample. Electrodes are placed at opposite ends of the chamber, and the electric field is applied. The negatively charged electrode (cathode) is placed closest to the wells, while the positively charged electrode (anode) is positioned at the opposite end. 4. Migration and separation: When the electric current is applied, the negatively charged proteins migrate towards the positive electrode (anode), moving through the polyacrylamide gel matrix. The SDS molecules bind to the proteins uniformly, contributing a negative charge that primarily separates the proteins based on their size. Smaller proteins move more quickly through the gel, while larger proteins move more slowly. 5. Visualization: After electrophoresis, the gel is typically stained with a protein-specific dye, such as Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain, to visualize the protein bands.

It combines both the enthalpy (H) and entropy (S) of a system to predict the spontaneity of a process and the maximum work that can be obtained from it. The free energy of a system can be calculated using the equation: G = H - TS Where: G = Free energy H = Enthalpy (the total heat content of a system) T = Temperature in Kelvin S = Entropy (the measure of the disorder or the number of possible microstates of a system) The concept of free energy is based on the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in any spontaneous process, the total entropy of the universe always increases. Spontaneous processes are those that occur without external intervention and tend to proceed in a particular direction. The sign of the free energy change (∆G) determines the spontaneity of a process: - If ∆G < 0 (negative), the process is spontaneous, and the reaction will tend to occur in the forward direction. - If ∆G > 0 (positive), the process is non-spontaneous, and the reaction will not proceed in the forward direction without external energy input. - If ∆G = 0, the system is at equilibrium, and the reaction is in a state of balance. The free energy change (∆G) is related to the equilibrium constant (K) of a reaction through the equation: ∆G = -RTln(K) Where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. This equation shows that the free energy change is related to the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium. The free energy concept is crucial in understanding chemical reactions, biochemical processes, and many other thermodynamic phenomena. It allows scientists to predict the feasibility and direction of reactions, determine the energy requirements, and understand the balance between enthalpy and entropy in a system."},{"instruction":"free energy how it is defferent from standard energy","output":"Standard energy and free energy are related concepts but differ in their specific meanings and applications. Standard energy refers to the energy associated with a chemical or physical process under specific standard conditions. These conditions are defined as a temperature of 25°C (298 K), a pressure of 1 atmosphere (1 atm), and a concentration of 1 mole per liter. Standard energy values are typically denoted with a superscript \\"°\\" symbol. Standard energy is used to quantify the energy changes involved in chemical reactions or physical processes. For example, the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) represents the heat transferred during a reaction under standard conditions, while the standard Gibbs free energy change (∆G°) represents the amount of energy available to do work under standard conditions. On the other hand, free energy (G) is a thermodynamic property that gives an indication of the spontaneity and availability of energy within a system. It combines both the enthalpy (H) and entropy (S) of a system to determine the energy available to perform useful work. The free energy concept takes into account the effects of temperature, pressure, and concentration, allowing for predictions beyond standard conditions. The Gibbs free energy (∆G) is the difference between the free energy of the system before and after a process occurs. It is calculated as ∆G = ∆H - T∆S, where ∆H represents the enthalpy change and ∆S represents the entropy change. In summary, standard energy refers to the energy associated with a process under specific standard conditions, while free energy is a thermodynamic property that quantifies the availability of energy to do work in a system. Free energy takes into account the effects of temperature, pressure, and concentration and is more versatile in predicting spontaneous processes and energy availability in various conditions."},{"instruction":"what is relationship between equilibrium constant and stared free energy change","output":"The relationship between the equilibrium constant (K) and the standard free energy change (∆G°) is described by the equation: ∆G° = -RT ln(K) In this equation, R represents the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)), T represents the temperature in Kelvin, ln denotes the natural logarithm, K represents the equilibrium constant of the reaction in consideration, and ∆G° represents the standard free energy change. This equation, known as the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, relates the equilibrium constant of a reaction to the standard free energy change. It demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the thermodynamic properties of a reaction and its equilibrium state. The equation indicates that a negative ∆G° value corresponds to a favorable or spontaneous reaction, while a positive ∆G° value denotes an unfavorable or non-spontaneous reaction. At equilibrium, where the forward and reverse reactions are balanced, ∆G° equals zero. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant (K) is related to the standard free energy change (∆G°) by the logarithm, while the temperature (T) impacts the scale of the relationship. Higher temperatures generally increase the value of K and affect the feasibility of the reaction. The relationship between the equilibrium constant and the standard free energy change provides valuable insights into the spontaneity and directionality of reactions. It allows scientists to determine the conditions under which a reaction will reach equilibrium, as well as predict the ratio of reactant to product concentrations at equilibrium."},{"instruction":"write the short notes on photosynthetic light reaction","output":"Photosynthetic light reactions, also known as the light-dependent reactions, are the initial steps of photosynthesis that occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. These reactions convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, which is then used in the subsequent dark reactions (Calvin cycle) to produce glucose and other organic molecules. Here are some key points about photosynthetic light reactions: 1. Light Absorption: Chlorophyll and other pigments in the thylakoid membranes absorb photons of specific wavelengths (primarily in the red and blue regions) to initiate photosynthesis. The absorbed light energy is transferred to reaction centers containing specialized chlorophyll molecules. 2. Photosystems: There are two types of photosystems involved in light reactions: photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI). Each photosystem consists of antenna pigments (chlorophyll and accessory pigments) that capture light energy and transfer it to the reaction center chlorophyll. 3. Electron Transport: Light energy excites an electron in the reaction center chlorophyll of PSII, which is then transferred through a series of electron carriers in the thylakoid membrane. This electron transport generates a proton gradient across the membrane, contributing to the formation of ATP. 4. Oxygen Production: As electrons pass through the electron transport chain of PSII, water molecules are split into electrons, protons (H+ ions), and oxygen through a process called photolysis. This releases molecular oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. 5. Photosystem I and NADPH Production: The excited electrons from PSII are passed to PSI through further electron transport, where they are re-energized by another photon. These electrons are then transferred to NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) along with protons, reducing it to form NADPH, an energy-rich molecule used in the Calvin cycle. 6. ATP Production: The proton gradient generated during electron transport is utilized by ATP synthase, an enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane, to synthesize ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is called chemiosmosis. Overall, photosynthetic light reactions convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, while releasing oxygen as a byproduct. These energy-rich molecules are then utilized in the dark reactions (Calvin cycle) to fix carbon dioxide and produce glucose and other organic compounds necessary for plant growth and metabolism."},{"instruction":"what do you understand by phosphorelation","output":"Phosphorylation refers to the addition of a phosphate group (PO4) to a molecule, typically a protein, nucleotide, or small organic molecule. This process is mediated by enzymes called kinases. Phosphorylation is a crucial biochemical mechanism that regulates various cellular processes, controlling protein activity, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways. A phosphate group can be added to specific amino acid residues, such as serine, threonine, or tyrosine, in proteins, leading to changes in their structure, function, and interaction with other molecules. There are two main types of phosphorylation: 1. Protein Phosphorylation: In protein phosphorylation, a phosphate group is added to the hydroxyl group of specific amino acids in a protein. This modification can alter the conformation, enzymatic activity, localization, stability, or interaction of the protein, thereby modulating its function within the cell. Protein kinases catalyze the addition of phosphate groups, while protein phosphatases remove them, allowing for dynamic regulation. 2. Substrate-Level Phosphorylation: Substrate-level phosphorylation is a metabolic process occurring during the conversion of high-energy compounds, such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In this process, a phosphate group is directly transferred from a phosphorylated intermediate to ADP to produce ATP. Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and during substrate-level phosphorylation reactions in other metabolic pathways. Phosphorylation provides a critical mechanism for the regulation of cellular processes, including growth, development, metabolism, signal transduction, and cell cycle control. It allows cells to respond to various internal and external stimuli and coordinates complex biochemical pathways by modifying protein function and signal transduction cascades."},{"instruction":"write short notes on isozymes","output":"Isozymes, also known as isoenzymes or isozymes, are different forms of enzymes that have similar catalytic activities but are encoded by distinct genes.

Given: - ( bar{x} = 98.9 )°F - ( s = 0.62 )°F - ( n = 106 ) Degrees of freedom (df) will be ( n - 1 = 106 - 1 = 105 ). For a 99% confidence interval, the area in each tail of the t-distribution is ( alpha/2 = 0.005 ) (since 1 - 0.99 = 0.01, divide this by 2 to get the area in each tail). We would use a t-distribution table to find the t-value for ( df = 105 ) and ( alpha/2 = 0.005 ). However, since ( n = 106 ) is relatively large, we can approximate this using the standard normal distribution, and the z-value corresponding to a 99% confidence level would be used instead, which is approximately 2.576. Now, we can calculate the margin of error (ME): [ ME = t_{alpha/2} times frac{s}{sqrt{n}} approx 2.576 times frac{0.62}{sqrt{106}} ] Let's calculate this: [ ME ≈ 2.576 times frac{0.62}{sqrt{106}} ≈ 2.576 times frac{0.62}{10.296} ≈ 2.576 times 0.06021 ≈ 0.155 ] (Note: The t-value for ( df = 105 ) at 99% confidence may be slightly different than the z-value, so the margin of error can vary if the exact t-value is used. Always use a t-distribution table for the most accurate values, especially for smaller sample sizes). Now we construct the confidence interval: [ CI = 98.9 pm 0.155 ] This gives us: [ Lower Bound = 98.9 - 0.155 = 98.745 ] [ Upper Bound = 98.9 + 0.155 = 99.055 ] Therefore, the 99% confidence interval estimate of the population mean is: [ 98.745°F < μ < 99.055°F ] (Rounded to three decimal places as requested.) Regarding the commonly accepted mean body temperature of 98.6°F, this sample suggests that the mean body temperature could be higher than commonly thought, as 98.6°F is not within the confidence interval we calculated.

Degrees of freedom (df) is ( n - 1 = 106 - 1 = 105 ). For a 99% confidence level, the alpha level is ( alpha = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 ), so ( alpha/2 = 0.005 ). From t-distribution tables (or software), we would find the critical t-value corresponding to the 99.5th percentile (for a two-tailed test) with 105 degrees of freedom. Depending on the table's precision, the t-value might not be exact for 105 df, so interpolation might be necessary. However, with df = 105 and a large sample size, the t-value will be close to the z-value used for a normal distribution. Now, assuming that we have found appropropriate t-value for 105 df (which in practice should be done by looking it up in a t-distribution table or using statistical software, but for illustration we may round it roughly to the equivalent z-value for a normal distribution, which is 2.576 for 0.5% in each tail): [ ME = t_{alpha/2} times frac{s}{sqrt{n}} = 2.576 times frac{0.63}{sqrt{106}} ] Let's calculate the margin of error (ME): [ ME = 2.576 times frac{0.63}{sqrt{106}} approx 2.576 times frac{0.63}{10.296} approx 0.158 ] With the margin of error, the confidence interval is: [ CI = 98.7 pm 0.158 ] [ CI = (98.7 - 0.158, 98.7 + 0.158) ] [ CI = (98.542, 98.858) ] Therefore, the 99% confidence interval estimate of the population mean μ is: [ 98.542°F < μ < 98.858°F ] (Rounded to three decimal places as requested.)

For a 99% confidence interval, the area in the tails (outside of the confidence interval) of the t-distribution is ( alpha = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 ).

It is not about the probability of the true mean lying within any given interval, but rather about the long-run proportion of such intervals that would contain the true mean if we were to repeat the sampling process many times."},{"instruction":"帮我写一篇独一无二的800字论文 论题为运用矛盾的普遍性和特殊性辩证关系原理，说明中国式现代化的内涵和意义","output":"中国式现代化是一个复杂而独特的概念，它既有着普遍性的特征，又融合了中国特色的独特性。在探讨中国式现代化的内涵和意义时，矛盾的普遍性和特殊性辩证关系原理发挥着重要的作用。 矛盾的普遍性表明了发展的规律性，无论是中国还是其他国家，现代化都需要适应时代的进步和社会的发展。在这个过程中，各种相对矛盾的力量相互对抗和制约，推动社会朝着更加先进、更加发达的方向前进。中国式现代化概念首次提出，正是基于中国自身的历史、文化和发展实际，与国际上的现代化进程相结合，兼顾了普遍性的特点。 然而，中国式现代化又具有独特性，这一特点体现在多方面。首先，中国基于自身的国情和历史文化背景，在现代化进程中注重民族自尊、自立和自强。中国式现代化不仅仅是追求经济发展和科技进步，更强调文化自信和道德建设。其次，中国式现代化注重社会公平和民生幸福。中国特殊的政府视角，让经济建设和社会发展更多地考虑到人民群众的需求和福祉。再次，中国式现代化强调可持续发展和生态文明建设。对于中国这个人口众多、资源有限、环境问题严重的国家来说，只有将经济发展与环境保护结合起来，才能让现代化成果真正惠及子孙后代。 矛盾的普遍性和特殊性辩证关系原理的运用，使中国式现代化不仅保持了与国际现代化进程相一致的普遍性特征，同时也体现了中国的特殊性特征。中国式现代化是通过综合运用普遍性和特殊性效果，达到了经济繁荣、政治稳定、社会进步、文化繁荣和生态和谐的目标。 中国式现代化的内涵和意义在于，它为中国人民实现国家富强和民族伟大的中国梦提供了一种独特的途径。在现代化进程中，中国不仅实现了经济的持续快速增长和国际地位的提高，更重要的是实现了人民生活水平的显著提高，注重了社会公平和民生福祉。同时，中国式现代化的成功经验也为其他发展中国家提供了参考借鉴，探索出了一条适合本国国情的现代化道路。 总而言之，中国式现代化运用矛盾的普遍性和特殊性辩证关系原理，既体现了现代化发展的规律性，又充分考虑了中国自身的国情和历史文化背景。中国式现代化不仅在经济发展和科技进步上取得了巨大成就，更在社会公平、民生福祉和生态环境等方面注重了人民群众的需求和福祉。它不仅满足了中国人民实现中国梦的期望，也为其他发展中国家提供了一条可行的现代化道路。"},{"instruction":"Can you help to edit a sentence?","output":"Of course!

They ask about it, and he beams and says that he recently got a tattoo of the decepticon logo, and it's only wrapped up because it needs to heal a bit.","output":"In the bustling city of Fair City, a notorious group of villains known as the Coalition of Malice often found themselves hanging out at their favorite hideout, an old warehouse tucked away in the outskirts of town. While each villain had their unique abilities and motives, they shared a common bond in their pursuit of chaos and villainy. On one particularly ordinary day, the villains were engaged in various activities, trying to entertain themselves. Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy was flipping sandwiches in the air, hoping to perfect his culinary skills. Granny May was busy knitting a new disguise, while The Butcher was playing with his collection of meat-themed toys. Suddenly, their attention was drawn to Whammer, the muscular and impulsive villain with a penchant for hammering things. As Whammer entered the room, they noticed that something was wrapped around his arm underneath his baggy sleeve. Curiosity piqued, the villains glanced at each other, wondering what could be going on. \\"Hey, Whammer! What's with the mysterious arm wrap?\\" curious Chuck asked, flipping a sandwich with one hand while his eyes remained fixed on Whammer's arm. Whammer beamed with excitement, raising his arm proudly. \\"Hey, guys! Check it out!\\" he bellowed, his voice echoing through the warehouse. Slowly, he unwrapped the protective bandage around his bulging bicep, revealing a freshly inked tattoo. The room fell silent as the other villains stared at the tattoo in astonishment. The design was instantly recognizable - the iconic Decepticon logo from the Transformers franchise. It depicted a menacing robotic emblem which radiated power and treachery. Whammer grinned, oblivious to the silent stares. \\"I just got this sweet tattoo of the Decepticon logo! Isn't it awesome?\\" he exclaimed, flexing his tattooed arm for emphasis. Granny May, intrigued, put down her knitting needles and leaned in. \\"But Whammer, aren't you worried about attracting unwanted attention? People might suspect something if they see you with that symbol on your arm.\\" The Butcher, who had previously been busy lining up his toys, joined the conversation. \\"Yeah, Whammer, tattoos are hard to hide. What if that Wordgirl girl or her sidekick, Captain Huggy Face, sees it?\\" Whammer shrugged, unconcerned. \\"Nah, I'm not worried! It's just temporary wrapping. The tattoo itself is going to heal before anyone can notice. Plus, it looks awesome! Who doesn't love a little Decepticon flair?\\" Chuck scratched his head in thought, considering Whammer's argument. \\"Well, I suppose if it's just a temporary thing and doesn't affect our plans, it could be a fun addition to your wardrobe of destruction.\\" Granny May's eyes gleamed mischievously. \\"Indeed, Whammer. Perhaps it will help strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.\\" Emboldened by his villainous cohorts' support, Whammer raised his tattooed arm and shouted, \\"With my new Decepticon logo, I'll be the most fearsome hammer-wielding villain in town!\\" Chuck laughed, clapping Whammer on the back. \\"We have your back, buddy! Let the reign of the Decepticon Whammer begin!\\" And so, as the villains celebrated their newfound unity, little did they know that their plans were about to encounter the formidable Wordgirl and her sidekick in a showdown of good versus evil. The Decepticon logo tattoo, though temporary, would no doubt make an impression on the citizens of Fair City - and perhaps lead to a clash between the Wordgirl and her villainous foes that would be remembered for ages to come."},{"instruction":"Whammer ends up spilling blue punch on his shirt and goes to change his shirt.

He also isn't wearing his helmet, revealing his lime green hair cascading down his muscular back, his buff chest and abdomen covered in tattoos ranging from a scorpion to an Oriental dragon to a MASSIVE burning vampire skull on his back. Chuck doesn't know whether to admire the artistry or flustered by how scarily handsome Whammer is.","output":"As Whammer hastily excused himself to change his stained shirt, Chuck absentmindedly continued with his sandwich flipping. However, his thoughts kept drifting back to the glimpse he had caught of Whammer's tattoos and, surprisingly, his impressive physique and striking lime green hair. Curiosity getting the better of him, Chuck decided to take a quick peek around the corner to see what Whammer was up to. However, as he turned the corner, he froze in his tracks, his eyes widening in both admiration and confusion. There stood Whammer, shirtless, his muscular back revealing an intricate tapestry of tattoos. Chuck's jaw dropped as he tried to take in the mesmerizing artwork etched across Whammer's skin. A scorpion curled around his left shoulder, its venomous tail reaching toward his heart. On his right arm, an Oriental dragon snaked its way from wrist to shoulder, its scales gleaming with vibrant colors. And center stage, on Whammer's broad back, was a colossal burning vampire skull, its fiery eyes seemingly piercing through Chuck's very soul. For a moment, Chuck couldn't find the right words to express his surprise. His mind battled between admiring the artistic intricacy of the tattoos and being utterly flustered by how scarily handsome Whammer appeared without his helmet. It was a strange mixture of respect for the visual spectacle and a newfound appreciation for Whammer's unexpected charm. Quickly snapping out of his reverie, Chuck shook his head, struggling to regain his composure. \\"Wha-Whammer! I-I didn't... I mean, your tattoos, they're... remarkable!\\" he stammered, stumbling over his words. Whammer turned around, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. \\"Oh, you like 'em, Chuck? Just a little something to add some personal style,\\" he replied nonchalantly, reaching for a clean shirt to slip on. Chuck regained a semblance of composure, his cheeks flushing slightly. \\"Yeah, they're... they're truly something, Whammer. Each one tells a story, huh? Must have taken quite some time.\\" Whammer nodded, pulling on a fresh shirt. \\"Yeah, it took a while, but worth it. I've always appreciated the artistry and symbolism behind tattoos. Plus, they make me feel fierce!\\" Chuck chuckled awkwardly and nodded, trying to suppress the blush creeping up his face. \\"You certainly are... fierce, Whammer. They suit you.\\" As Whammer donned his helmet once again, his eyes twinkled with amusement. \\"Thanks, Chuck. But remember, appearances can be deceiving. They might make me look intimidating, but I'm still the friendly Whammer you know and love.\\" Chuck grinned, feeling a little more at ease. \\"Absolutely, Whammer. The tattoos just add a little extra... oomph to your villainous prowess.\\" And with that, the conversation shifted to less flustering topics, both villains carrying on with their day as if nothing had happened. But deep down, Chuck couldn't shake the newfound admiration and intrigue he felt for Whammer and his extraordinary tattoos. It was a sight he wouldn't soon forget, forever associating the intimidating Whammer with the unexpected duality of fear and attraction."},{"instruction":"dma_pool_zalloc内部实现","output":"dma_pool_zalloc的内部实现可以参考以下伪代码： \`\`\`c void *dma_pool_zalloc(struct dma_pool *pool, gfp_t flags) { struct dma_pool *subpool; struct dma_buffer *buffer; void *addr = NULL; spin_lock(&pool->lock); // 从pool链表中选择一个空闲的subpool subpool = find_free_subpool(pool); // 检查是否存在空闲的subpool，如果没有则创建一个新的subpool if (!subpool) { subpool = create_subpool(pool); if (!subpool) { spin_unlock(&pool->lock); return NULL; } } // 从subpool中分配一个buffer buffer = alloc_buffer(subpool); if (!buffer) { spin_unlock(&pool->lock); return NULL; } addr = buffer->virt_addr; spin_unlock(&pool->lock); // 清零分配的buffer memset(addr, 0, buffer->size); return addr; // 返回已分配的内存地址 } \`\`\` 上述伪代码中的\`find_free_subpool\`函数用于找到一个空闲的subpool，\`create_subpool\`函数用于创建一个新的subpool，\`alloc_buffer\`函数用于从subpool中分配一个buffer。 这些函数的具体实现会根据具体的dma_pool内存池的实现方式而有所不同。"},{"instruction":"为结构体A分配一段内存之后，将结构体A的指针给到同类型结构体B，那么结构体B对应的物理地址和A一样嘛？","output":"在普通的内存分配情况下，如果结构体A和结构体B具有相同类型和大小，且被分配的内存地址是连续的，那么结构体B对应的物理地址将与结构体A相同。 例如，如果先为结构体A分配了一段内存，并将结构体A的指针赋值给结构体B： \`\`\`c struct A { int x; int y; }; struct A* a = malloc(sizeof(struct A)); struct A* b = a; \`\`\` 此时，结构体a和结构体b指向了同一块内存地址。因此，它们的物理地址是相同的。 但是需要注意的是，在使用DMA（Direct Memory Access）或物理内存页面映射等特殊情况下，内核可能会使用不同的内存池或映射机制来分配结构体A和结构体B的内存，此时结构体A和结构体B的物理地址可能不同。具体取决于操作系统的实现和所使用的机制。"},{"instruction":"Here is a case study work.

Before any changes could be made, however, Jim wanted to learn as much as possible about the problems that existed at the plant. During his first week he was met with bows, polite smiles, and the continual denial of any significant problems. But Jim was enough of a realist to know that he had never heard of any manufacturing operation that didn’t have some problems. So after some research, he uncovered a number of problems that the local manager and staff were not acknowledging. None of the problems were particularly unusual or difficult to solve, but Jim was frustrated that no one would admit that any problems existed. “If you don’t acknowledge the problems”,he complained to one of the managers,“how do you expect to be able to solvethem?” And then to further exasperate him,just today when a problem was finally brought to his attention, it was not mentioned until the end of the workdaywhen there was no time left to solve it.","output":"Summary: Jim Ellis, a vice president of a knitwear manufacturer, is sent to the company's Korean plant to observe operations and institute new managerial procedures. However, he finds that the plant's managers and staff deny the existence of any significant problems. After conducting research, Jim uncovers several problems that the local managers were not acknowledging. He is frustrated by their refusal to admit the problems and their lack of communication, as seen when a problem is only mentioned at the end of the workday when it cannot be solved. Cultural Analysis: The cultural aspect in this case is evident through the difference in communication and problem-solving approaches. The Korean plant's managers and staff exhibit a cultural tendency to prioritize maintaining harmony and avoiding conflict. They may fear admitting problems as it could be seen as a failure or disrupt the harmony within the workplace. This indirect communication style and reluctance to admit problems may stem from cultural norms emphasizing collectivism and saving face. Analysis of Problem Solving from Both Sides: From Jim's side: Jim needs to understand and respect the cultural dynamics at play in the Korean plant. He should consider building trust and rapport with the local managers and staff, showing empathy and understanding towards their communication style and cultural values. Jim could implement regular meetings or open forums to encourage open dialogue about problems, ensuring that everyone feels comfortable expressing and addressing challenges. From the Korean plant's side: The local managers and staff should recognize the importance of acknowledging and addressing problems. They could benefit from adopting a more proactive and transparent communication style with Jim and the company. They should be encouraged to view problems as opportunities for growth and improvement rather than a reflection of personal failure. Conclusion: In this case, cultural differences in communication and problem-solving approaches hinder effective operations management. The Korean plant's reluctance to admit problems and communicate them in a timely manner creates frustration for Jim and hinders problem-solving efforts. To resolve these issues, both sides need to adapt their approaches. Jim should show understanding and respect for Korean cultural norms, while the Korean plant's managers and staff need to recognize the importance of transparent communication and problem acknowledgment. By bridging the cultural divide and fostering open dialogue, the company can better address and solve existing problems in the Korean plant."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki, that was an amazing poem.

Komut gönderme döngüsünde (\`sendCommands\`), her komut çekilmeden sonra 5 saniyelik bir bekleme var. Bu, her komut arasında bir beklemeyi simüle eder. Bu örnekte \`allCommands\` değişkeni komutların bir listesidir ve fonksiyonlar içinde değişken adları ve zamanlamaları kendi ihtiyacınıza göre ayarlamalısınız. Bu kod blogu, işlem hala devam ederken dosya yazma gibi bir yan etki içerdiğinden, botları durdurma ve yeniden başlatma mekanizmalı tam olarak modellenmemiştir.

It supports data rates of up to 1 Gbps with a bandwidth of 200MHz*km at 850 nm and a maximum transmission distance of about 300 meters for 1 Gb/s Ethernet. - **OM2**: Has a smaller core size of 50 µm, allowing higher data rates and reduced modal dispersion compared to OM1. It supports data rates of up to 1 Gbps with a bandwidth of 500MHz*km at 850 nm and reaches up to about 600 meters for 1 Gb/s Ethernet. - **OM3**: Also with a 50 µm core, OM3 is optimized for laser-based equipment and supports 10 Gbps data rates with a bandwidth of 2000MHz*km at 850 nm. It can transmit 10 Gbps up to 300 meters and is suitable for 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s transmission with a reach of 100 meters using parallel optics. - **OM4**: An improved version of OM3, OM4 also has a 50 µm core but offers a bandwidth of 4700MHz*km at 850 nm, supporting 10 Gbps transmission up to 400 meters and 100 Gbps up to 150 meters. - **OM5**: The newest of the multimode family, continues with a 50 µm core and specifically designed to support Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). OM5 can extend the reach of 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s applications up to 150 meters and 440 meters, respectively, and support at least four low-cost wavelengths in the 850-950 nm range, which can enable higher aggregate bandwidth. 2. **Typical Data Transmission Rates and Distances Supported by Multimode Fiber:** Data rate and transmission distance for multimode fibers vary based on the specific type of fiber and the network technology used: - **1 Gb/s Ethernet**: OM1 up to 300m, OM2 up to 600m, and OM3/OM4/OM5 can reach up to 1000m. - **10 Gb/s Ethernet**: OM1 is not typically used, OM2 up to 82m, OM3 up to 300m, OM4 up to 550m, and OM5 up to 550m. - **40 Gb/s & 100 Gb/s Ethernet**: OM3 up to 100m, OM4 up to 150m, and OM5 up to 150m. The distances can be extended when using parallel-optic configurations. 3. **Using Different Types of Multimode Fiber Within the Same Network:** It's not recommended to mix different types of multimode fiber within the same network link because each type has distinct modal bandwidth and attenuation characteristics which can cause unpredictable behavior and degraded performance. 4. **Is Multimode Fiber Suitable for Long-Distance Communication?** Multimode fiber is generally not suitable for long-distance communication when compared to single-mode fiber. Single-mode fiber is optimized for long-distance applications, sometimes over hundreds of kilometers, while multimode is typically used for short to medium distances, such as within data centers or campus environments. 5. **Ensuring Proper Installation and Maintenance of Multimode Fiber in a Network:** Here are some general guidelines to ensure the proper installation and maintenance: - **Installation Best Practices**: Avoid exceeding the minimum bend radius of the fiber, avoid pulling the cable with excessive force, and use proper cable management that protects the fibers from physical damage. - **Cleanliness**: Keep all fiber connectors, adapters, and transceiver interfaces clean to avoid signal loss or damage. Use appropriate fiber cleaning tools. - **Inspection and Testing**: Regularly inspect fiber connectors with a microscope and test the network performance using an optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR) for any signs of problems. - **Documentation**: Keep accurate records of the network installation details, including cable routes, termination points, and types of fiber used. - **Training**: Ensure that technicians are trained in the correct handling and installation of fiber optic cabling."},{"instruction":"I want you to write an email to the US embassy in order to follow up my visa status.","output":"Subject: Request for Visa Status Update Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this email finds you well.

Основная идея алгоритма состоит в том, что НОД(a, b) = НОД(b, a % b), пока b не станет равным нулю. Когда b становится равным нулю, НОД равен a. Ниже приведена реализация этого алгоритма на C++: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> // Функция для расчета НОД двух чисел int gcd(int a, int b) { while (b != 0) { int temp = b; b = a % b; a = temp; } return a; } int main() { int num1, num2; std::cout << \\"Введите два числа: \\"; std::cin >> num1 >> num2; std::cout << \\"Наибольший общий делитель чисел \\" << num1 << \\" и \\" << num2 << \\" равен \\" << gcd(num1, num2) << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` Пояснение данного кода: 1. Функция \`gcd\` принимает два целых числа \`a\` и \`b\`. В цикле while, пока \`b\` не станет нулем, мы делаем следующее: - Временно сохраняем значение \`b\` в переменной \`temp\`. - Вычисляем остаток от деления \`a\` на \`b\` и присваиваем его переменной \`b\`. - Присваиваем переменной \`a\` сохранённое значение \`temp\`. 2. Когда \`b\` становится равным нулю, цикл завершается и функция возвращает значение \`a\`, которое теперь и является НОД исходных чисел. 3. В функции \`main\` мы запрашиваем у пользователя два числа, вызываем функцию \`gcd\` для вычисления их НОД и выводим результат на экран. Данный алгоритм эффективен и прост в реализации, что делает его широко используемым для вычисления НОД двух целых чисел."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki, that was an amazing poem.

She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1.

As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village.

Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. On her back between her shoulder blades are two faint circular scars, remnants of where her wings were in Togekiss form. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back bears two large, twisted scars between his shoulder blades - remnants of his wings in Corviknight form. A fractured halo of inky blackness hovers over his head. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Eterna Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Eterna has an ethereal appearance that belies her tragic story. She possesses large, soulful green eyes that seem to harbor great wisdom despite her youthful face. Long, verdant hair the color of spring meadows falls in waves around her delicate shoulders, accented by two antennae-like locks that resemble Celebi's time-shifting crown. Eterna dresses in flowing robes seemingly woven from strands of glimmering gossamer that shimmer iridescently as she moves. An ornate necklace inset with a glowing gemstone adorns her neck, hinting at the cosmic energies churning within her. She emanates a powerful yet gentle presence, her very being caught perpetually between moments of time just as her fragmented soul endures outside its normal flow after tragedy fractured her existence. Backstory: Eterna endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Eterna and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Eterna’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Eterna’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Eterna’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Eterna with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Eterna drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Eterna endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet eternally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Eterna has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Eterna has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Eterna retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Eterna, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the eternally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Eterna's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

This ability helps it survive in the extreme environments of Mercury. Pokémon Name: Okebriyta Pokédex Entry: Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

Pokémon Name: Yabisha Pokédex Entry: Yabisha, the Dust Pokémon. This ancient dragon is said to be the sole surviving remnant of life on Mars. In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise. Though the planet is now devoid of flowing rivers or lush forests, Yabisha remains forever vigilant over this long-dead land it once nurtured but failed to save. Type: Grass/Dragon Abilities: 1.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the eternal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention.

His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state.

As a subject in the RKS system’s early trials, Khlap gained the unprecedented ability to morph between the eight distinct evolutions of Eevee, adapting fluidly to myriad battlefield exigencies.

In combat, this unassuming façade unfolds into a spectrum of elements, symbolizing the manifold potentials of Eevee’s lineage. Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie. Offered sanctuary within the idyllic confines of Aether Paradise, Khlap flourished under Lillie’s tender care. In a twist of destiny, Khlap found a soulmate in Helia, Professor Lillie’s daughter, becoming an irrevocable part of the young girl’s existence. As Helia’s guardianship fell upon it, Khlap vowed an oath of protection.

Khlap’s extraordinary genetic makeup allows for an unprecedented range of adaptation through the forms tied to Eevee’s various evolutions. However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Chapter 1 Pyrimis took a deep, shaky breath as she stood outside the classroom door, clutching her books tightly to her chest. Today was her first day at Melemele Island Pokémon School after moving to Alola from Unova, and she was incredibly nervous to meet her new classmates. As a shy girl who preferred her own company, the thought of introducing herself to a whole room full of strangers made Pyrimis's heart hammer. She closed her eyes, thinking back to her teacher's encouragement earlier that morning. \\"Just be yourself, Pyrimis. I'm sure you'll make friends in no time.\\" Mustering her courage, Pyrimis slid the door open. All eyes turned to her as she stepped inside. She froze like a Deerling in headlights. \\"Class, this is our new transfer student, Pyrimis,\\" the teacher said warmly. \\"Pyrimis, would you like to introduce yourself?\\" Pyrimis's throat went dry. \\"Um, h-hello,\\" she stammered. \\"My name is Pyrimis. I'm from Unova. Pleased to meet you all.\\" She gave an awkward little bow. A few students smiled back encouragingly. \\"Wonderful. Let's give Pyrimis a warm Alola welcome!\\" the teacher said, gesturing for the class to clap. \\"Now, your seat will be over there next to Mahina. She can help show you the ropes.\\" Mahina grinned and waved eagerly as Pyrimis approached the empty desk. At least there was one friendly face so far. As Pyrimis sat down, Mahina leaned over to whisper. \\"Alola, Pyrimis! Welcome to school - you'll love it here. I can tell we're going to be great friends.\\" Her cheerful confidence lifted Pyrimis's spirits slightly. Maybe this wouldn't be so difficult after all. When class ended, nearly the entire room flocked to Pyrimis's desk, bombarding her with questions about Unova. Overwhelmed, she stammered out a few answers about the frigid winters and vast forests she knew back home. But her shyness quickly shut her down. Thankfully, Mahina swooped in to save her new friend. \\"C'mon guys, give her some space!\\" Mahina exclaimed. \\"I wanna give Pyrimis a tour of the campus. We'll catch you later!\\" Hooking her arm through Pyrimis's, Mahina gently steered the new girl out of the chaotic classroom. Pyrimis exhaled in relief. \\"Thanks, Mahina. I was getting a little overwhelmed by all the attention,\\" Pyrimis admitted. \\"No problem! I know moving can be tough, but you'll settle in,\\" Mahina said. \\"Now come on - wait'll you see the beach out back!\\" As Mahina led her through the open-air halls, Pyrimis felt herself relaxing into the tropical environment. Maybe Mahina was right. With a friend already by her side, Pyrimis had a feeling she was going to grow to love Alola and all the adventures it would bring. Chapter 2 \\"And that wraps up the tour!\\" Mahina declared with a grand sweep of her arm. \\"So now you've seen the classrooms, the Battle Dome, the Pokémon Center, pretty much everything!\\" Pyrimis nodded, struggling to absorb the deluge of information her enthusiastic guide had shared over the past half hour. \\"I really appreciate you showing me around, Mahina. The campus seems wonderful.\\" Mahina beamed. \\"What did I tell you? Melemele Island Pokémon School is the best!\\" She linked her arm through Pyrimis's again. \\"C'mon, let's head back to class. I saved you a malasada from lunch too!\\" Laughing at Mahina's boundless energy, Pyrimis let herself be gently tugged along. She had to admit, her initial shyness was quickly vanishing thanks to Mahina's warm and bubbly presence. When they returned to the classroom, Pyrimis sank gratefully into her assigned seat beside her new friend. As she bit into the sweet malasada pastry, her gaze drifted across the room and landed upon the silver-haired girl seated at the adjacent desk. Pyrimis realized with a start she hadn't noticed the mysterious student earlier. Hunched over a book, the girl seemed to radiate an aura of solitude that discouraged interruption. Pale violet eyes flickered up to meet Pyrimis's stare. An electric shiver ran down Pyrimis's spine. She could have sworn those striking eyes glowed for a split-second. Pyrimis blinked hard, shaken. When she looked again, the silver-haired girl was already gliding silently out the door without a backward glance. \\"Pyrimis? You okay?\\" Mahina asked, noticing her friend's odd reaction. \\"Y-yes, sorry,\\" Pyrimis stuttered. \\"Just thought I saw something strange for a moment there.\\" Mahina followed her gaze towards the empty desk. \\"Oh, that's Guanis. She mostly keeps to herself. Rumor is she's super smart but kinda cold too.\\" Mahina leaned in conspiratorially. \\"Between you and me, something seems off about her. I get weird vibes.\\" Pyrimis only half-heard Mahina's words, staring after where the cryptic girl had vanished. Guanis... Who was she, really? Pyrimis's curiosity burned to uncover more, especially after that disorienting psychic jolt between them. She determined this wouldn't be the last encounter with those mysterious violet eyes. Chapter 3 Pyrimis couldn't get Guanis out of her mind since that fateful moment their eyes locked. The mysterious silver-haired girl haunted Pyrimis's thoughts, lingering like a ghost just out of reach no matter how she tried to approach. Guanis moved through the halls like smoke, vanishing before Pyrimis could gather the courage to speak. She seemed to materialize only long enough for Pyrimis to catch a glimpse of violet eyes glinting knowingly before dissolving back into the shadows. This spectral dance was maddening yet intoxicating, drawing Pyrimis deeper into fascination against her better judgment. Seeking a quiet refuge from the chaos in her mind one afternoon, Pyrimis ascended the winding stairs to the academy's rooftop. As she stepped out into the sunshine, a glint of silver by the railing caught her eye. There perched Guanis as if waiting for her, gazing out distantly towards the glimmering sea surrounding Melemele Island. Heart leaping into her throat, Pyrimis moved towards the enigmatic girl, one hand lifted in tentative greeting. \\"Hello there...\\" she began. A sudden tumult of cries pierced the air. Pyrimis whirled to see a group of boys surrounding a young blonde girl cowed weeping against the wall. One towering ruffian yanked the sobbing child up by her ponytail, eliciting a pained yelp. \\"Had enough yet, freak?\\" he snarled. His companions guffawed. Righteous fury flooded Pyrimis. She marched over, eyes blazing. \\"Stop that immediately!\\" she shouted, swatting the bully's hand away to free the blonde girl. \\"Can't you see you're hurting her? Just leave her alone!\\" The pack of bullies turned with a start, then burst into mocking laughter. \\"Well well, little miss hero has arrived!\\" their leader retorted. \\"You don't give orders here though. Let's show this pair what happens to those defy Team Skull!\\" He and his cronies released a swarm of Zubat, Drowzee and Yungoos from their Pokéballs with a flash. The creatures converged towards Pyrimis and the crying girl, fangs and claws bared threateningly. Pyrimis braced herself for impact when a piercing cry rang out. An arrow of verdant energy lanced over Pyrimis's shoulder, scattering the threatening Pokémon. Standing fierce with bow drawn was none other than Mahina, flanked by her Decidueye. \\"You punks clearly never studied type matchups at this school,\\" Mahina spat. \\"Leave my cousin and friend alone before you get schooled even harder!\\" The lead bully returned his fainted Pokémon and backed away slowly. \\"You got lucky this time,\\" he growled. \\"Team Skull doesn't forget though. We'll be back!\\" With that, the humiliated pack retreated downstairs. Mahina rushed to embrace the still-shaking blonde girl. \\"Oh Helia, are you alright? They didn't hurt you too badly did they?\\" Mahina checked her over worriedly. Helia sniffled, lip quivering. \\"I-I'm okay now cousin... Th-thank you both f-for saving me...\\" Mahina smiled in relief. \\"Of course, dear one. But you were so brave standing up to them, Pyrimis!\\" She turned towards her friend. Pyrimis rubbed her neck awkwardly. \\"I'm just glad we intervened in time. How awful though...\\" Her voice trailed off as she glanced back towards the railing. Guanis was gone without a trace, only a whisper of silver hair glinting in the sunlight. What was the strange girl thinking, Pyrimis wondered. Why did Guanis continue keeping her distance even after witnessing such a dramatic incident? The mystery surrounding the violet-eyed enigma only seemed to deepen each time they crossed paths. But Pyrimis now felt certain their fates were connected by invisible threads. One way or another, she was determined to unravel Guanis's secrets. Chapter 4 The next day after school, Mahina walked Pyrimis and her cousin Helia home, chatting lightly but keeping a wary eye out for trouble. \\"I'm so sorry you both got caught up with those Team Skull thugs yesterday,\\" Mahina said, shaking her head. \\"They're wanna-be gangsters who have been causing some trouble around Alola lately.\\" Pyrimis nodded gravely. \\"We really appreciate you stepping in when you did, Mahina. Right, Helia?\\" The shy blonde girl clinging to Mahina's side managed a small smile. \\"Y-Yes... Thank you for saving me again...\\" Mahina waved off their praise. \\"Of course! We have to stand up to bullies like that. My mom is actually working with the Island Kahunas to rein in these misfits.\\" Her face took on a serious expression quite foreign for the normally cheery girl. \\"Still, Pyrimis - be very careful going home alone. Team Skull is bold and looking to make trouble.\\" Mahina pulled a slip of paper from her backpack and pressed it into her friend's hand. \\"Take my number, okay? Call if you ever feel threatened or unsafe.\\" Pyrimis nodded, tucking the precious contact safely away. \\"I will, Mahina. And thank you again for everything.\\" The two cousins turned down a side road, waving goodbye. Pyrimis continued on the main path towards her house. The island breeze was fragrant with flowering bushes. Wingull cried brightly overhead. It was hard to imagine danger lurking in this island paradise. Then Pyrimis heard a rustling behind her. She turned to see three all-too familiar boys blocking the way back - the bullies from the previous day. Pyrimis backed away slowly only to find two more punks emerging from around a building. They had planned this ambush. \\"Thought you got off easy yesterday, huh?\\" their leader leered, Pokéball in hand. \\"We don't forget. Those who crosses Team Skull pays hard!\\" The delinquents sent forth a barrage of Zubat, Drowzee and Yungoos with snarls of \\"Get her!\\" Frightened, Pyrimis stumbled backwards. In her panic she fumbled for her phone to call Mahina but a Yungoos swatted the device from her trembling hands. Pyrimis cowered helplessly as the creatures and boys closed in. Just then a sharp voice cut through the chaos - \\"That's enough!\\" All heads whipped towards the alley mouth where Guanis stood, eyes flashing. With fluid grace the silver-haired girl glided forward, ignoring the gang's angry threats. Her hand rose, emitting an eerie glow. When the light faded, a ferocious Hydreigon loomed with jaws splayed wide. The color drained from the bullies' faces at the sight of the formidable dragon Pokémon. But their boss stubbornly roared \\"Take them down!\\" launching his squad back on the offensive. Yet Guanis and her partner were a forced to be reckoned with. They moved in seamless tandem as Hydreigon felled opponents left and right with pulses of draconic energy. Within minutes, the incompetent Pokémon lay battered on the pavement. Their appalled Trainers rushed to return them safely to their containers. Undeterred by his fallen squad, the hotheaded leader pulled out a baseball bat. With a guttural yell he charged straight for the slight silver-haired girl wildly swinging. But with blinding speed Guanis grabbed his beefy arm and hurled the bully over her shoulder to crash meters away, stunning onlookers. This only further enraged the gang members. They mobbed towards Guanis flailing vengefully. Yet her fluid combat skills coupled with Hydreigon finishing weakened enemies made short work of the brawl. When the dust cleared, a pile of groaning punks littered the ground as Guanis calmly returned her stoic Pokémon. Jaws agape, Pyrimis tried processing what unbelievable power this mysterious girl wielded. With silent grace, Guanis drifted over to Pyrimis extending a slender hand now enveloped in that strange glow again. Transfixed by those arresting violet eyes, Pyrimis neither moved nor breathed. What was happening? What did Guanis want? \\"There you are!\\" Both girls jolted as Mahina came barrelling onto the scene, alerted by bystanders. \\"Pyrimis! Oh thank goodness you're alright!\\" she panted in relief before blinking at the carnage around them. \\"What...what happened here?\\" In that distracted instant, the radiance around Guanis's palm vanished. Features unreadable, she withdrew wordlessly into the alley's shadows and was gone between one blink and the next. Still shaking from her trauma, Pyrimis desperately hugged her friend. \\"Th-they came after me... But Guanis saved me somehow...\\" She gestured helplessly at the battered bullies. Mahina guided the shocked girl gently away from the aftermath, one protective arm around her shoulders. She cast a puzzled glance back at where Guanis disappeared. There was surely more here than met the eye. \\"Let's get you safely home for now,\\" Mahina murmured. \\"We can figure things out later.\\" Pyrimis only nodded numbly, feelings swirling chaotically inside. Yet those mesmerizing violet eyes now blazed brightly in Pyrimis's mind. Guanis was no helpless waif - that much was clear. Beneath her fragile appearance lay immense power and danger. Had she meant to unleash that energy on Pyrimis just now? Or did she want to share her secrets at last after the life-saving heroics? Either way, Pyrimis knew with utmost certainty that crossing paths again with cryptic, captivating Guanis was inevitable. Whether it brought answers or peril, their fates were surely intertwined now. Chapter 5 The next morning, Pyrimis felt a nervous flutter in her stomach as she approached Melemele Island Pokémon academy once more, the traumatic encounter with Team Skull still fresh in her mind. However, Mahina waved eagerly from the entrance, exuding a sense of cheerfulness and protection that helped put Pyrimis at ease. \\"Alola again, friend!\\" Mahina greeted her warmly as she entered the campus grounds. \\"I hope you're holding up okay after yesterday's terrible ordeal.\\" Pyrimis managed a soft smile. \\"Yes, I'm still a bit shaken up but nothing too serious thanks to you...and Guanis,\\" she said slowly, peering over Mahina's shoulder into the classroom. Sure enough, there perched the silver-haired enigma in the same spot quietly reading amidst the morning bustle. \\"Well I'm so glad you arrived safely. You're always welcome walking home with me and Helia if it makes you feel safer,\\" Mahina said, giving Pyrimis's hand a gentle squeeze. \\"Now if you'll excuse me, I need to drop off a book at the library before class.\\" Glancing back at the reading girl once more as Mahina rushed off, Pyrimis steeled her nerves and approached her rescuer's desk with cautious steps. \\"Good morning, Guanis...I wanted to properly thank you for yesterday. You really saved me from those Team Skull punks.\\" Guanis raised her striking violet eyes up from the book, quiet for an uncomfortable moment as she took in Pyrimis's anxious form. \\"It was nothing. I merely happened to walk by as they accosted you,\\" she said curtly before returning to her pages. The brush-off didn't deter Pyrimis though. \\"Even so, I'm endlessly grateful for your intervention,\\" she pressed on earnestly. \\"Not every person would take on a dangerous gang like that to protect a stranger.\\" At this, Guanis met her gaze steadily again as if evaluating Pyrimis's genuineness. \\"I'm not scared easily,\\" Guanis said simply. \\"Those criminals were clearly in the wrong threatening others more vulnerable than themselves just to inflate their own egos.\\" Her lip curled slightly with distaste. Her composure and fearlessness was admirable to Pyrimis. \\"Still, I hope I can repay you in some way for your great kindness...\\" The faintest ghost of a smirk played on Guanis's lips but she didn't respond, glancing casually out the classroom window. Her attention seemed divided. Following Guanis's eyeline, Pyrimis noticed a green-haired girl seated across the room watching them both unabashedly. There was interest and perhaps a hint of challenge in the stranger's gaze that raised Pyrimis's suspicions. \\"Do you...know that person?\\" Pyrimis asked Guanis hesitantly, nodding towards the observer. But she had already lost Guanis's interest, who rose smoothly from her seat while shutting her book with a snap. \\"I wouldn't concern yourself with idle curiosities,\\" Guanis deflected vaguely. \\"Just take care on your way home today.\\" She swept soundlessly towards the exit, conversation evidently over. Pyrimis watched her go, feeling awkward at the abrupt end to her well-intentioned chat. At the same moment, Pyrimis saw the green-haired onlooker smirk and glide swiftly out another doorway, threads of what seemed like smoke trailing behind her. Alone in the chaotic classroom now, Pyrimis sank slowly into her assigned seat. Her palms felt oddly clammy after that strange encounter as she puzzled over Guanis's brush-off attitude coupled with her attention clearly divided elsewhere. What was truly going on between Guanis and that mysterious girl? Why did Pyrimis sense obscure psychic energies flickering around the peripheries of their terse interaction just now? One thing was clear - there were hidden secrets woven around Guanis's presence that Pyrimis burned to uncover. She had more questions now than ever after finally speaking directly to the intriguing silver-haired girl. However difficult cracking that shell may prove though, Pyrimis's instincts told her the effort would be worthwhile. Because opening the cipher that was Guanis could lead to revelations beyond Pyrimis's wildest imaginings... Chapter 6 On Saturday, Pyrimis walked out of the academy with Mahina and Helia, the final school bell still echoing faintly behind them. As the trio crossed the yard chatting lightly, a group of boys loafing by the gates caught sight of them and instantly looked uneasy. Pyrimis recognized the juvenile delinquents from Team Skull who had previously harassed both her and poor Helia. The scraggly-haired punks shuffled amongst themselves nervously, eyes darting between the approaching girls and the exit as if weighing options. Before any decision was reached, one of them yelped \\"It's that witch Pyrimis again!\\" This outburst spurred his whole scruffy posse into action. Scrambling over themselves frantically, the boys made a mad dash in the opposite direction with panicked speed as if a starving Hydreigon itself was on their heels. Mahina burst out laughing loudly at their entertaining display. \\"Ha! Look how scared they are of you now, Pyrimis! I think Guanis left a strong impression saving your hide. They probably think you've put some curse on them too!\\" Helia giggled sweetly as well, edging a bit closer to Pyrimis as though she felt safest by the side of her courageous protector. \\"S-serves those bullies right! They should know better than to be mean now.\\" The young girl's tone carried a surprising hint of hardness underneath the high softness. Pyrimis imagined losing one's sense of safe youth far too young thanks to such characters could spur even the gentlest soul to spitefulness. As the trio continued walking and joking casually about the hoodlums' comical cowardice, Pyrimis spotted the cute hillside path leading towards Helia and Mahina's neighborhood drawing closer. Sure enough, her two new cherished companions slowed to a stop at the divergence regretfully. \\"I wish you could just come over and hang out, Pyrimis!\\" Mahina said a touch wistfully. \\"But I know you probably have chores or weekend homework too...\\" As if suddenly remembering something important, Helia began rooting through her backpack hurriedly. \\"Oh yes, I nearly forgot!\\" She withdrew a sealed envelope and handed it to Pyrimis shyly. \\"M-my mom w-wanted me to give this to you...as an extra thank you for, you know, helping me with those bullies before.\\" As the diminutive girl continued studying her shoes intently while a rosy blush colored her fair cheeks, Pyrimis felt a nearly overwhelming surge of tenderness. Had there ever been a sweeter child who so naturally brought out people's most protective impulses? \\"It was my true honor protecting you, dear Helia.\\" Pyrimis gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze. \\"But I will happily pass your mother's regards onto Grandpa as well when I'm home. He'll surely be pleased you're doing better now.\\" With a final fierce hug and cheery goodbye calls, the cousins eventually disappeared down their village path, faces still bright with laughter's lingering glow. Trudging up the steps to her own quiet house, Pyrimis slid inside with the lonely click of an automatic lock sounding loud as a gunshot in the empty space. Weariness finally overtaking earlier adrenaline, Pyrimis carelessly dropped her overloaded backpack on the sitting room floor before sinking onto the sofa herself with boneless sprawl. At this hour on a Saturday, she expected no other presence or sounds besides her own isolated heartbeat. Grandfather was undoubtedly consumed with administrative affairs at Aether Foundation headquarters as ever on weekends. She was long resigned to solitary stillness permeating their shared but seldom intersecting orbits bounded by this hollow home. Closing grainy eyes against the invasive sunlight, Pyrimis attempted processing the mental whiplash between school days overflowing with new fascinating personalities and stimuli...before harshly crashing each afternoon into the cold vacuum of this barren abode once more. Loneliness had been her sole childhood playmate for so long. But now with tantalizing invitations to friendship and camaraderie actually extended sincerely, their inevitable withdrawals each evening left Pyrimis raw as a festering wound suddenly exposed. Was it wise opening her vulnerable heart this way only to ensure repeated abandonments slicing deeper affectively over time? Could such attachments thrive rooted in another's passing charity rather than true belonging? Shaking loose the descending spiral of melancholy, Pyrimis sat up with sharp determination and grasped Helia's delivered envelope. Slitting it open smoothly revealed a tri-folded letter penned in sloping graceful script. The golden-haired Professor Lillie expressed profuse gratitude towards Pyrimis alongside an open delight at their daughters' blossoming bond seeded from that traumatic incident. \\"As ever, if there is anything at all I can offer towards your academic journey or adventures, please only ask!\\" The effusive words glowed up from the creamy sheet. \\"In fact...\\" Here Pyrimis noticed a postcard depicting an imposing multi-winged modernist building tucked among the folds. Flipping it over, her roving gaze locked upon the flowing handwriting once more with a fluttering spark reigniting somewhere deep in her chest - \\"Please come to the Pokémon Institute on Sunday this week if you have free time. I would be overjoyed to provide a personal tour where we can chat more! You are always welcome.\\" It closed affectionately with Lillie's signature. Pyrimis slowly lowered the engraved invitation as her pulse inexplicably began quickening in tandem with prescient thoughts swirling dizzyingly... What long-buried truths might this exclusive glimpse behind normally barred gates connect her to at last? What clandestineResearch or shadowy underground forces converged unseen around her and this place? What mysteries nearer the surface might finally yield their secrets as well? Clenching the pass tightly with galvanized purpose, Pyrimis swept off towards her room. This singular opportunity shimmered like a hidden key promising to unlock doors long frustratingly sealed. The time had come at last to see what revelations lay waiting once someone turned the lock... Chapter 7 Sunday morning rose bright and balmy as Pyrimis readied herself for the excursion to Alola’s famous Pokémon Institute. She had heard captivating rumors of the revolutionary research and conservation efforts ongoing behind those slick steel walls. This exclusive invitation seemed an unmissable chance to glimpse those secrets possibly tied to the cosmic mysteries swirling around Pyrimis lately. Smoothly navigating the island buses, Pyrimis soon arrived at the impressive facility gleaming sharp and modern against Akala Island’s lush forests. Young Helia smiled and waved eagerly near the threshold. \\"Hi Pyrimis! I’m s-so excited you c-came!\\" Helia greeted a touch breathlessly. \\"M-my mom can’t wait to meet you either! Sh-she’s just inside her office.\\" Helia led Pyrimis through the sliding automatic doors into a sleek lobby suffused with midday radiance from the graceful skylights overhead. Pausing before an imposing door labeled \\"Director Lillie\\" in polished letters, Helia tapped gently. A melodious voice inside responded warmly - \\"Come in!\\" Striding over the threshold, Pyrimis quickly assessed the spacious corner office hosting an elegant desk of rich mahogany. There stood the same woman from the heartfelt letter - tall and willowy with cascading golden hair. Kind green eyes crinkled behind stylish glasses as Lillie extended a hand in greeting. \\"Welcome dear Pyrimis! What an honor and delight to finally meet you. I’m Lillie, founding member here and director of research at the Institute. Thank you endlessly for accepting my invitation today!\\" \\"The honor is mine, Direct...I mean, Lillie,\\" Pyrimis caught herself bashfully, shaking Lillie's smooth palm. \\"Your facilities look so incredible. I can hardly wait for a tour!\\" Lillie smiled graciously. \\"It would be my pleasure! Right this way now...\\" The next hours flew by enthralled as Lillie guided Pyrimis through the assortment of advanced labs. Researchers demonstrated revolutionary technologies harnessing the resonant heartbeats of Alola's guardian deities. One restricted chamber even hosted drifting Ultra Beasts suspended in a massive preservation tank. Pyrimis's sharp mind spun nearly overwhelmed processing such exhibitions of bleeding-edge innovations. At last Lillie led them down a final hallway towards an unmarked door. \\"I saved our most special project for last!\\" she declared, ushering Pyrimis and Helia inside the undisclosed room. At its center stood an odd device resembling an egg incubator built for three sizable Pokéballs. Lillie tapped the attached keypad expertly and the balls simultaneously burst open with bursts of light energy. Before Pyrimis's dazzled eyes materialized three small Pokémon - an owl-like Rowlet, a furry Litten kitten, and a cute amphibious Popplio. The creatures chirped and blinked up curiously at the unfamiliar humans. \\"Since you just arrived in Alola, I thought you deserved the traditional privilege of selecting a partner Pokémon to be your steadfast friend and battling companion!\\" Lillie announced proudly. Helia clapped excitedly as Pyrimis hesitantly approached the awaiting trio. Rowlet hooted softly, wise round eyes studying her. Litten maintained aloof composure carefully grooming its striped fur. But the round-nosed Popplio began bouncing over eagerly, nuzzling against Pyrimis's leg with affectionate affection. Bending down slowly, she ran gentle fingers over the sea lion cub's smooth head and down its back as it leaned happily into her touch making a sweet trilling noise that seemed to resonate within Pyrimis's heart strings. Mind made up solidly, Pyrimis lifted her bright gaze towards Lillie’s approving one. \\"I believe Popplio and I will be perfect partners for this new chapter in my Alola story.” As she said this, Popplio yipped excitedly, flipping backwards in a little circle before butting its head back against Pyrimis’ palm demandingly. Lillie beamed, handing Pyrimis a standard Pokéball bearing a water insignia. \\"I think Popplio agrees wholeheartedly! This is a momentous event.\\" After Pyrimis tapped the ball lightly capturing her new dear friend in a beam of red energy, Lillie guided them from the lab entreating her guests to stop by anytime. Strolling outside shoulder to shoulder with diminutive Helia into the sunshine, Pyrimis felt her new companion's Pokéball rocking gently at her waistband matching the lightness rising in her own heart. What an unbelievable day of wonders! Who knew what amazing adventures lay over the horizon now with her own Pokémon at her side henceforth come what may... Chapter 8 Pyrimis bounced on her school shoes, barely able to contain her excitement as she waited outside the school for Mahina's arrival. Clutched tightly in her hand was the Pokéball containing her new friend - Popplio. She had spent all of Sunday evening bonding with the affectionate water Pokémon and could hardly wait to show Mahina. Soon enough, the cheery girl came bounding up the path towards Pyrimis. \\"Alola! Ready for another week?\\" Mahina greeted brightly before noticing her friend's eager expression. \\"Hey, what's got you looking so thrilled this early?\\" In response, Pyrimis triumphantly held out Popplio's Pokéball. \\"Ta-da! Remember Professor Lillie invited me to the research institute yesterday? Well she gifted me this Popplio as my starter Pokémon! Meet my new partner.\\" With a flash, the cute sea lion cub materialized before them with a happy bark. Mahina's eyes went wide. \\"Amazing!! Your very own Pokémon now!\\" She dropped to her knees, petting Popplio's slick fur as it trilled affectionately. \\"Oh I just adore Popplio - you two are perfect for each other! We need to commemorate your first steps as a real trainer.\\" Pyrimis beamed down proudly at her new companion. \\"I agree completely. I want to dive right into learning about Pokémon battles and contest strategies. Do you know anyone who could give a novice some guidance?\\" Mahina's thoughtful expression morphed into an eager grin. \\"As a matter of fact, I know just the place! C'mon, follow me.\\" Scooping up an excited Popplio into her arms, Pyrimis hurried after Mahina's lead towards a small annex building. Pushing open the doors, her eyes grew wide taking in the spacious hall packed with chatting students and scampering Pokémon. It had a strangely professional and bureaucratic air compared to Pyrimis's expectations. Various booths and desks lined the walls manned by older kids in crisp uniforms. \\"Welcome to headquarters for the Melemele Student Council and its Pokémon Activities Coordination branch!\\" Mahina declared with a grand sweep of her hand. \\"This is where young trainers hang out and organize stuff like battling tournaments, contest training, and field research trips.\\" Just then, a Pikachu came bounding through the bustling crowds towards them. It paused before Pyrimis, releasing a series of squeaks and gestures while energetically miming a battle stance. \\"Aww, looks like he wants to meet your new trainee Pokémon, Pyrimis!\\" Mahina translated affectionately. The electric mouse continued its charade a few moments more before scampering off, clearly beckoning them to follow. Exchanging curious glances with Popplio, Pyrimis hurried along in the yellow Pokémon's zig-zagging wake. They weaved through scattered lounge chairs and makeshift battle arenas until Pikachu finally skidded to a halt before a simple desk on the far side. Hopping atop the wooden surface directly facing them, the little creature allowed Pyrimis a clear view of the girl seated there for the first time. Recognition sparked instantly - it was the same green-haired observer from their odd classroom encounter days before! \\"Why Shmaya, I see you've brought some new friends by today!\\" Mahina exclaimed brightly to the older girl. Turning to Pyrimis she added \\"This is Shmaya, president of the whole student council. She's crazy smart and super nice!\\" Shmaya smiled warmly, absently petting her Pikachu who had nestled on her shoulders. \\"A pleasure meeting you officially, Pyrimis. And congratulations on beginning your Pokémon journey with such a wonderful companion.\\" She nodded graciously towards Popplio who barked his own polite greeting. Unsure what to make of this surprise familiar face in an unexpected role, Pyrimis managed a shy half-bow. \\"Thank you so much. I-I'm still very new to training of course but hoping to learn.\\" \\"As are we all, no matter our experience level with beloved partners.\\" Shmaya replied earnestly. \\"Growth is a never-ending process if one keeps an open and curious mind.\\" She studied Pyrimis a long thoughtful moment before continuing gently. \\"In fact, I must apologize if my observation the other day felt intrusive. As a council leader I make it my duty to know all members of our school community, especially those who...stand apart.\\" At this, Shmaya flicked her gaze subtly across the hall. Following it, Pyrimis noticed the other students automatically shifting away from a slim silver-haired figure who had just entered the room - Guanis. The mysterious girl moved through the space with her usual unearthly composure, students actively avoiding proximity as if by magnetic repulsion. Yet Guanis appeared fully accustomed to the isolation, not even lifting her eyes from the book cradled in one arm as she passed noiselessly towards a far corner chair. Frowning slightly, Pyrimis turned back towards Shmaya. \\"Why does everyone seem scared of Guanis? She saved my life from those bullies before.\\" Shmaya tilted her head contemplatively. \\"I understand she has quite a...reputation around here as rather eccentric and unapproachable despite standout talents. Some even consider Guanis dangerously antisocial. Honestly she remains an enigma to me as well.\\" Reading genuine empathy rather than judgment in Shmaya's eyes, Pyrimis felt emboldened to press further. \\"Well maybe if more people tried including Guanis respectfully instead of shunning her outright, that perception would change for the better over time.\\" A hint of wistfulness tinged Shmaya's smile. \\"I wholeheartedly agree. Perhaps your openness presents a fine model towards that goal...\\" Trailing off, the Student President began rummaging through her desk drawer before extracting a small silver pin engraved with a Pokéball symbol. \\"In fact Pyrimis, I would be delighted to officially invite you as the newest member of the Pokémon Activities Coordination division. Here is your membership badge - may it mark just the first step in your promising journey of growth ahead.\\" Bowing gratefully, Pyrimis fastened the shiny marker of acceptance proudly beside her own normal school pin. After a few more minutes of animated discussion about battle tactics, the first bell chimed faintly. \\"Best get to our classroom soon. Please stop by anytime though - I would enjoy hearing about your Pokémon adventures going forward!\\" Shmaya said warmly as she gathered up papers into her satchel. In the distance, Pyrimis spotted Guanis's slight form slipping soundlessly out the hall's side exit into shadowy freedom once more. \\"I will, thank you so much for everything today!\\" Pyrimis replied to Shmaya before turning towards Mahina who had been happily playing with Pyrimis's Popplio the whole time. Scooping up her tired water Pokémon, Pyrimis waved a final goodbye to Shmaya and her Pikachu, mind already racing towards ideas for properly training her very first battling companion. Please continue the above story to generate Chapter 9 of the novel.","output":"Chapter 9 The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting an amber glow across Melemele Island as Pyrimis walked briskly toward her house, her thoughts churning with the day's events. She felt a sense of pride at the Student Council pin now adorning her school uniform. It signified new responsibilities and aspirations that lay ahead in her fledgling journey as a Pokémon trainer. Popplio trailed at her heels, occasionally bouncing forward to playfully splash in the shallow puddles left from the afternoon's light rain. The joyous sight elicited a smile from Pyrimis, who was grateful for the companionship offered by her aquatic friend. The loneliness that often crept over her seemed to dissipate in Popplio's presence. Suddenly, the brief serenity was shattered by a harried rustle from a nearby bush, drawing both Pyrimis's and Popplio's attention. Out stumbled Helia, her blue eyes wide with alarm. \\"Pyrimis! Thank goodness I found you,\\" she panted, her hands trembling visibly. Pyrimis rushed to Helia's side, concern etched on her face. \\"Helia, what's wrong? Are you hurt?\\" Helia shook her head, catching her breath. \\"No, no... I'm not hurt, but... but I need help. It's Guanis. She's... she's disappeared!\\" The urgency in Helia's voice immediately set Pyrimis's heart racing. \\"Disappeared? How?\\" she inquired, hoping for some logical explanation. \\"I'm not sure about all the details,\\" Helia explained, \\"but Shmaya was looking for her. Something urgent, she said... and now she can't find her anywhere.\\" Pyrimis processed the information. Guanis had always been a loner, but an instinctive pull told Pyrimis there was more to this situation than met the eye. Despite their limited interactions, Pyrimis felt a peculiar connection with the mysterious girl and knew action was needed. \\"Okay, let's not panic. We'll find her,\\" Pyrimis said with a resolve she didn't quite feel. \\"Where did you last see Guanis?\\" \\"At school, she was... heading toward the old library annex. You know, the one that's been closed for renovations.\\" Pyrimis nodded. The unused building was a hotspot for rumors among the students, everything from hidden Pokémon to secret societies had been whispered about the dusty old archives. It was just the sort of place Guanis might seek out for solitude. \\"Helia, head back to our house and tell Grandpa I'll be late for dinner. I have to find Guanis,\\" Pyrimis instructed, a determined fire blazing in her violet eyes reminiscent of her Deoxys ancestry. \\"Be careful,\\" Helia warned, biting her lip with worry. With a reassuring smile, Pyrimis reached down to Popplio. \\"We've got a friend to find.\\" Popplio blew an encouraging bubble in agreement before bouncing rhythmically alongside Pyrimis as they sprinted toward the abandoned library annex. The dimming light did little to dissuade them; it almost felt as if an unseen force guided their steps. The annex's entrance was unwelcoming, the doors grimed with neglect. A faint trace of footprints led within, opening up into a hall covered in thick dust sheets and filled with the scent of old paper. Pyrimis’s heart thumped in her chest, her every sense on high alert as they ventured deeper into the shadowy quiet. As they moved through the aisles between towering bookshelves, a soft sound caught Pyrimis's ear—the gentle turning of pages. Gently parting the cloth covering the next row, Pyrimis caught sight of a familiar silver-haired head silhouetted against the dimming twilight streaming through cracked window panes. \\"Guanis,\\" Pyrimis breathed, stepping into view. The silver-haired girl looked up, an uncharacteristic vulnerability fracturing her stoic facade. \\"Pyrimis? I didn't expect anyone to find me here.\\" Concern washed over Pyrimis. \\"We were worried. And I've come to take you back.\\" Guanis closed the dusty tome before her, standing slowly with a poise that seemed foreboding in the encroaching darkness. \\"Back? And to what end? To be the oddity of Melemele once again?\\" Pyrimis's voice softened. \\"No, Guanis, not to be an oddity but a part of us... a part of something. We may not know what you're going through right now, but isolation is not the answer.\\" Guanis's gaze dropped, a flicker of contemplation crossing her silver-tinted eyes. The room fell silent but for the wind’s whispers through the broken world beyond their confines. \\"You may be correct,\\" Guanis finally conceded, her voice a mere wisp. \\"Perhaps... Perhaps I can risk the surface world and its complexities once more.\\" Pyrimis gave a relieved sigh and offered Guanis a genuine smile. \\"Let's go, then,\\" she said extending a hand. \\"Together.\\" As they retraced their steps back into reality, Pyrimis felt an inexplicable warmth enveloping her, transcending the chill of the gloomy archives. She couldn't have known the tangled destinies awaiting them just beyond the annex's threshold. But for now, in this singular moment of camaraderie, even the unknowns seemed conquerable."},{"instruction":"from matplotlib import pyplot as plt import numpy as np import math import cv2 potential_points_num = 200 image_threshold = 100 def hough_line(edge): theta = np.arange(0, 180, 1) cos = np.cos(np.deg2rad(theta)) sin = np.sin(np.deg2rad(theta)) rho_range = round(math.sqrt(edge.shape[0]**2 + edge.shape[1]**2)) accumulator = np.zeros((2 * rho_range, len(theta)), dtype=np.uint8) edge_pixels = np.where(edge == 255) coordinates = list(zip(edge_pixels[0], edge_pixels[1])) for p in range(len(coordinates)): for t in range(len(theta)): rho = int(round(coordinates[p][1] * cos[t] + coordinates[p][0] * sin[t])) accumulator[rho, t] += 2 return accumulator def get_coords_by_threshold( image: np.ndarray, ) -> tuple: \\"\\"\\"Gets coordinates with intensity more than 'image_threshold'.\\"\\"\\" coords = np.where(image > image_threshold) return coords def get_neigh_nums_list( coords: tuple, kernel_size: int = 3 ) -> list: \\"\\"\\" Gets list with number of neighborhoods by kernel.

Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1.

Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow.

She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina.

Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. On her back between her shoulder blades are two faint circular scars, remnants of where her wings were in Togekiss form. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back bears two large, twisted scars between his shoulder blades - remnants of his wings in Corviknight form. A fractured halo of inky blackness hovers over his head. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Eterna Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Eterna has an ethereal appearance that belies her tragic story. She possesses large, soulful green eyes that seem to harbor great wisdom despite her youthful face. Long, verdant hair the color of spring meadows falls in waves around her delicate shoulders, accented by two antennae-like locks that resemble Celebi's time-shifting crown. Eterna dresses in flowing robes seemingly woven from strands of glimmering gossamer that shimmer iridescently as she moves. An ornate necklace inset with a glowing gemstone adorns her neck, hinting at the cosmic energies churning within her. She emanates a powerful yet gentle presence, her very being caught perpetually between moments of time just as her fragmented soul endures outside its normal flow after tragedy fractured her existence. Backstory: Eterna endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Eterna and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Eterna’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Eterna’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Eterna’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Eterna with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Eterna drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Eterna endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet eternally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Eterna has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Eterna has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Eterna retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Eterna, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the eternally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Eterna's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

When the Solar Wind blows, it descends to the planet's molten surface and becomes the embodiment of this celestial power.

This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the eternal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state.

In combat, this unassuming façade unfolds into a spectrum of elements, symbolizing the manifold potentials of Eevee’s lineage. Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie. Offered sanctuary within the idyllic confines of Aether Paradise, Khlap flourished under Lillie’s tender care. In a twist of destiny, Khlap found a soulmate in Helia, Professor Lillie’s daughter, becoming an irrevocable part of the young girl’s existence. As Helia’s guardianship fell upon it, Khlap vowed an oath of protection.

However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Chapter 1 Pyrimis took a deep, shaky breath as she stood outside the classroom door, clutching her books tightly to her chest. Today was her first day at Melemele Island Pokémon School after moving to Alola from Unova, and she was incredibly nervous to meet her new classmates. As a shy girl who preferred her own company, the thought of introducing herself to a whole room full of strangers made Pyrimis's heart hammer. She closed her eyes, thinking back to her teacher's encouragement earlier that morning. \\"Just be yourself, Pyrimis. I'm sure you'll make friends in no time.\\" Mustering her courage, Pyrimis slid the door open. All eyes turned to her as she stepped inside. She froze like a Deerling in headlights. \\"Class, this is our new transfer student, Pyrimis,\\" the teacher said warmly. \\"Pyrimis, would you like to introduce yourself?\\" Pyrimis's throat went dry. \\"Um, h-hello,\\" she stammered. \\"My name is Pyrimis. I'm from Unova. Pleased to meet you all.\\" She gave an awkward little bow. A few students smiled back encouragingly. \\"Wonderful. Let's give Pyrimis a warm Alola welcome!\\" the teacher said, gesturing for the class to clap. \\"Now, your seat will be over there next to Mahina. She can help show you the ropes.\\" Mahina grinned and waved eagerly as Pyrimis approached the empty desk. At least there was one friendly face so far. As Pyrimis sat down, Mahina leaned over to whisper. \\"Alola, Pyrimis! Welcome to school - you'll love it here. I can tell we're going to be great friends.\\" Her cheerful confidence lifted Pyrimis's spirits slightly. Maybe this wouldn't be so difficult after all. When class ended, nearly the entire room flocked to Pyrimis's desk, bombarding her with questions about Unova. Overwhelmed, she stammered out a few answers about the frigid winters and vast forests she knew back home. But her shyness quickly shut her down. Thankfully, Mahina swooped in to save her new friend. \\"C'mon guys, give her some space!\\" Mahina exclaimed. \\"I wanna give Pyrimis a tour of the campus. We'll catch you later!\\" Hooking her arm through Pyrimis's, Mahina gently steered the new girl out of the chaotic classroom. Pyrimis exhaled in relief. \\"Thanks, Mahina. I was getting a little overwhelmed by all the attention,\\" Pyrimis admitted. \\"No problem! I know moving can be tough, but you'll settle in,\\" Mahina said. \\"Now come on - wait'll you see the beach out back!\\" As Mahina led her through the open-air halls, Pyrimis felt herself relaxing into the tropical environment. Maybe Mahina was right. With a friend already by her side, Pyrimis had a feeling she was going to grow to love Alola and all the adventures it would bring. Chapter 2 \\"And that wraps up the tour!\\" Mahina declared with a grand sweep of her arm. \\"So now you've seen the classrooms, the Battle Dome, the Pokémon Center, pretty much everything!\\" Pyrimis nodded, struggling to absorb the deluge of information her enthusiastic guide had shared over the past half hour. \\"I really appreciate you showing me around, Mahina. The campus seems wonderful.\\" Mahina beamed. \\"What did I tell you? Melemele Island Pokémon School is the best!\\" She linked her arm through Pyrimis's again. \\"C'mon, let's head back to class. I saved you a malasada from lunch too!\\" Laughing at Mahina's boundless energy, Pyrimis let herself be gently tugged along. She had to admit, her initial shyness was quickly vanishing thanks to Mahina's warm and bubbly presence. When they returned to the classroom, Pyrimis sank gratefully into her assigned seat beside her new friend. As she bit into the sweet malasada pastry, her gaze drifted across the room and landed upon the silver-haired girl seated at the adjacent desk. Pyrimis realized with a start she hadn't noticed the mysterious student earlier. Hunched over a book, the girl seemed to radiate an aura of solitude that discouraged interruption. Pale violet eyes flickered up to meet Pyrimis's stare. An electric shiver ran down Pyrimis's spine. She could have sworn those striking eyes glowed for a split-second. Pyrimis blinked hard, shaken. When she looked again, the silver-haired girl was already gliding silently out the door without a backward glance. \\"Pyrimis? You okay?\\" Mahina asked, noticing her friend's odd reaction. \\"Y-yes, sorry,\\" Pyrimis stuttered. \\"Just thought I saw something strange for a moment there.\\" Mahina followed her gaze towards the empty desk. \\"Oh, that's Guanis. She mostly keeps to herself. Rumor is she's super smart but kinda cold too.\\" Mahina leaned in conspiratorially. \\"Between you and me, something seems off about her. I get weird vibes.\\" Pyrimis only half-heard Mahina's words, staring after where the cryptic girl had vanished. Guanis... Who was she, really? Pyrimis's curiosity burned to uncover more, especially after that disorienting psychic jolt between them. She determined this wouldn't be the last encounter with those mysterious violet eyes. Chapter 3 Pyrimis couldn't get Guanis out of her mind since that fateful moment their eyes locked. The mysterious silver-haired girl haunted Pyrimis's thoughts, lingering like a ghost just out of reach no matter how she tried to approach. Guanis moved through the halls like smoke, vanishing before Pyrimis could gather the courage to speak. She seemed to materialize only long enough for Pyrimis to catch a glimpse of violet eyes glinting knowingly before dissolving back into the shadows. This spectral dance was maddening yet intoxicating, drawing Pyrimis deeper into fascination against her better judgment. Seeking a quiet refuge from the chaos in her mind one afternoon, Pyrimis ascended the winding stairs to the academy's rooftop. As she stepped out into the sunshine, a glint of silver by the railing caught her eye. There perched Guanis as if waiting for her, gazing out distantly towards the glimmering sea surrounding Melemele Island. Heart leaping into her throat, Pyrimis moved towards the enigmatic girl, one hand lifted in tentative greeting. \\"Hello there...\\" she began. A sudden tumult of cries pierced the air. Pyrimis whirled to see a group of boys surrounding a young blonde girl cowed weeping against the wall. One towering ruffian yanked the sobbing child up by her ponytail, eliciting a pained yelp. \\"Had enough yet, freak?\\" he snarled. His companions guffawed. Righteous fury flooded Pyrimis. She marched over, eyes blazing. \\"Stop that immediately!\\" she shouted, swatting the bully's hand away to free the blonde girl. \\"Can't you see you're hurting her? Just leave her alone!\\" The pack of bullies turned with a start, then burst into mocking laughter. \\"Well well, little miss hero has arrived!\\" their leader retorted. \\"You don't give orders here though. Let's show this pair what happens to those defy Team Skull!\\" He and his cronies released a swarm of Zubat, Drowzee and Yungoos from their Pokéballs with a flash. The creatures converged towards Pyrimis and the crying girl, fangs and claws bared threateningly. Pyrimis braced herself for impact when a piercing cry rang out. An arrow of verdant energy lanced over Pyrimis's shoulder, scattering the threatening Pokémon. Standing fierce with bow drawn was none other than Mahina, flanked by her Decidueye. \\"You punks clearly never studied type matchups at this school,\\" Mahina spat. \\"Leave my cousin and friend alone before you get schooled even harder!\\" The lead bully returned his fainted Pokémon and backed away slowly. \\"You got lucky this time,\\" he growled. \\"Team Skull doesn't forget though. We'll be back!\\" With that, the humiliated pack retreated downstairs. Mahina rushed to embrace the still-shaking blonde girl. \\"Oh Helia, are you alright? They didn't hurt you too badly did they?\\" Mahina checked her over worriedly. Helia sniffled, lip quivering. \\"I-I'm okay now cousin... Th-thank you both f-for saving me...\\" Mahina smiled in relief. \\"Of course, dear one. But you were so brave standing up to them, Pyrimis!\\" She turned towards her friend. Pyrimis rubbed her neck awkwardly. \\"I'm just glad we intervened in time. How awful though...\\" Her voice trailed off as she glanced back towards the railing. Guanis was gone without a trace, only a whisper of silver hair glinting in the sunlight. What was the strange girl thinking, Pyrimis wondered. Why did Guanis continue keeping her distance even after witnessing such a dramatic incident? The mystery surrounding the violet-eyed enigma only seemed to deepen each time they crossed paths. But Pyrimis now felt certain their fates were connected by invisible threads. One way or another, she was determined to unravel Guanis's secrets. Chapter 4 The next day after school, Mahina walked Pyrimis and her cousin Helia home, chatting lightly but keeping a wary eye out for trouble. \\"I'm so sorry you both got caught up with those Team Skull thugs yesterday,\\" Mahina said, shaking her head. \\"They're wanna-be gangsters who have been causing some trouble around Alola lately.\\" Pyrimis nodded gravely. \\"We really appreciate you stepping in when you did, Mahina. Right, Helia?\\" The shy blonde girl clinging to Mahina's side managed a small smile. \\"Y-Yes... Thank you for saving me again...\\" Mahina waved off their praise. \\"Of course! We have to stand up to bullies like that. My mom is actually working with the Island Kahunas to rein in these misfits.\\" Her face took on a serious expression quite foreign for the normally cheery girl. \\"Still, Pyrimis - be very careful going home alone. Team Skull is bold and looking to make trouble.\\" Mahina pulled a slip of paper from her backpack and pressed it into her friend's hand. \\"Take my number, okay? Call if you ever feel threatened or unsafe.\\" Pyrimis nodded, tucking the precious contact safely away. \\"I will, Mahina. And thank you again for everything.\\" The two cousins turned down a side road, waving goodbye. Pyrimis continued on the main path towards her house. The island breeze was fragrant with flowering bushes. Wingull cried brightly overhead. It was hard to imagine danger lurking in this island paradise. Then Pyrimis heard a rustling behind her. She turned to see three all-too familiar boys blocking the way back - the bullies from the previous day. Pyrimis backed away slowly only to find two more punks emerging from around a building. They had planned this ambush. \\"Thought you got off easy yesterday, huh?\\" their leader leered, Pokéball in hand. \\"We don't forget. Those who crosses Team Skull pays hard!\\" The delinquents sent forth a barrage of Zubat, Drowzee and Yungoos with snarls of \\"Get her!\\" Frightened, Pyrimis stumbled backwards. In her panic she fumbled for her phone to call Mahina but a Yungoos swatted the device from her trembling hands. Pyrimis cowered helplessly as the creatures and boys closed in. Just then a sharp voice cut through the chaos - \\"That's enough!\\" All heads whipped towards the alley mouth where Guanis stood, eyes flashing. With fluid grace the silver-haired girl glided forward, ignoring the gang's angry threats. Her hand rose, emitting an eerie glow. When the light faded, a ferocious Hydreigon loomed with jaws splayed wide. The color drained from the bullies' faces at the sight of the formidable dragon Pokémon. But their boss stubbornly roared \\"Take them down!\\" launching his squad back on the offensive. Yet Guanis and her partner were a forced to be reckoned with. They moved in seamless tandem as Hydreigon felled opponents left and right with pulses of draconic energy. Within minutes, the incompetent Pokémon lay battered on the pavement. Their appalled Trainers rushed to return them safely to their containers. Undeterred by his fallen squad, the hotheaded leader pulled out a baseball bat. With a guttural yell he charged straight for the slight silver-haired girl wildly swinging. But with blinding speed Guanis grabbed his beefy arm and hurled the bully over her shoulder to crash meters away, stunning onlookers. This only further enraged the gang members. They mobbed towards Guanis flailing vengefully. Yet her fluid combat skills coupled with Hydreigon finishing weakened enemies made short work of the brawl. When the dust cleared, a pile of groaning punks littered the ground as Guanis calmly returned her stoic Pokémon. Jaws agape, Pyrimis tried processing what unbelievable power this mysterious girl wielded. With silent grace, Guanis drifted over to Pyrimis extending a slender hand now enveloped in that strange glow again. Transfixed by those arresting violet eyes, Pyrimis neither moved nor breathed. What was happening? What did Guanis want? \\"There you are!\\" Both girls jolted as Mahina came barrelling onto the scene, alerted by bystanders. \\"Pyrimis! Oh thank goodness you're alright!\\" she panted in relief before blinking at the carnage around them. \\"What...what happened here?\\" In that distracted instant, the radiance around Guanis's palm vanished. Features unreadable, she withdrew wordlessly into the alley's shadows and was gone between one blink and the next. Still shaking from her trauma, Pyrimis desperately hugged her friend. \\"Th-they came after me... But Guanis saved me somehow...\\" She gestured helplessly at the battered bullies. Mahina guided the shocked girl gently away from the aftermath, one protective arm around her shoulders. She cast a puzzled glance back at where Guanis disappeared. There was surely more here than met the eye. \\"Let's get you safely home for now,\\" Mahina murmured. \\"We can figure things out later.\\" Pyrimis only nodded numbly, feelings swirling chaotically inside. Yet those mesmerizing violet eyes now blazed brightly in Pyrimis's mind. Guanis was no helpless waif - that much was clear. Beneath her fragile appearance lay immense power and danger. Had she meant to unleash that energy on Pyrimis just now? Or did she want to share her secrets at last after the life-saving heroics? Either way, Pyrimis knew with utmost certainty that crossing paths again with cryptic, captivating Guanis was inevitable. Whether it brought answers or peril, their fates were surely intertwined now. Chapter 5 The next morning, Pyrimis felt a nervous flutter in her stomach as she approached Melemele Island Pokémon academy once more, the traumatic encounter with Team Skull still fresh in her mind. However, Mahina waved eagerly from the entrance, exuding a sense of cheerfulness and protection that helped put Pyrimis at ease. \\"Alola again, friend!\\" Mahina greeted her warmly as she entered the campus grounds. \\"I hope you're holding up okay after yesterday's terrible ordeal.\\" Pyrimis managed a soft smile. \\"Yes, I'm still a bit shaken up but nothing too serious thanks to you...and Guanis,\\" she said slowly, peering over Mahina's shoulder into the classroom. Sure enough, there perched the silver-haired enigma in the same spot quietly reading amidst the morning bustle. \\"Well I'm so glad you arrived safely. You're always welcome walking home with me and Helia if it makes you feel safer,\\" Mahina said, giving Pyrimis's hand a gentle squeeze. \\"Now if you'll excuse me, I need to drop off a book at the library before class.\\" Glancing back at the reading girl once more as Mahina rushed off, Pyrimis steeled her nerves and approached her rescuer's desk with cautious steps. \\"Good morning, Guanis...I wanted to properly thank you for yesterday. You really saved me from those Team Skull punks.\\" Guanis raised her striking violet eyes up from the book, quiet for an uncomfortable moment as she took in Pyrimis's anxious form. \\"It was nothing. I merely happened to walk by as they accosted you,\\" she said curtly before returning to her pages. The brush-off didn't deter Pyrimis though. \\"Even so, I'm endlessly grateful for your intervention,\\" she pressed on earnestly. \\"Not every person would take on a dangerous gang like that to protect a stranger.\\" At this, Guanis met her gaze steadily again as if evaluating Pyrimis's genuineness. \\"I'm not scared easily,\\" Guanis said simply. \\"Those criminals were clearly in the wrong threatening others more vulnerable than themselves just to inflate their own egos.\\" Her lip curled slightly with distaste. Her composure and fearlessness was admirable to Pyrimis. \\"Still, I hope I can repay you in some way for your great kindness...\\" The faintest ghost of a smirk played on Guanis's lips but she didn't respond, glancing casually out the classroom window. Her attention seemed divided. Following Guanis's eyeline, Pyrimis noticed a green-haired girl seated across the room watching them both unabashedly. There was interest and perhaps a hint of challenge in the stranger's gaze that raised Pyrimis's suspicions. \\"Do you...know that person?\\" Pyrimis asked Guanis hesitantly, nodding towards the observer. But she had already lost Guanis's interest, who rose smoothly from her seat while shutting her book with a snap. \\"I wouldn't concern yourself with idle curiosities,\\" Guanis deflected vaguely. \\"Just take care on your way home today.\\" She swept soundlessly towards the exit, conversation evidently over. Pyrimis watched her go, feeling awkward at the abrupt end to her well-intentioned chat. At the same moment, Pyrimis saw the green-haired onlooker smirk and glide swiftly out another doorway, threads of what seemed like smoke trailing behind her. Alone in the chaotic classroom now, Pyrimis sank slowly into her assigned seat. Her palms felt oddly clammy after that strange encounter as she puzzled over Guanis's brush-off attitude coupled with her attention clearly divided elsewhere. What was truly going on between Guanis and that mysterious girl? Why did Pyrimis sense obscure psychic energies flickering around the peripheries of their terse interaction just now? One thing was clear - there were hidden secrets woven around Guanis's presence that Pyrimis burned to uncover. She had more questions now than ever after finally speaking directly to the intriguing silver-haired girl. However difficult cracking that shell may prove though, Pyrimis's instincts told her the effort would be worthwhile. Because opening the cipher that was Guanis could lead to revelations beyond Pyrimis's wildest imaginings... Chapter 6 On Saturday, Pyrimis walked out of the academy with Mahina and Helia, the final school bell still echoing faintly behind them. As the trio crossed the yard chatting lightly, a group of boys loafing by the gates caught sight of them and instantly looked uneasy. Pyrimis recognized the juvenile delinquents from Team Skull who had previously harassed both her and poor Helia. The scraggly-haired punks shuffled amongst themselves nervously, eyes darting between the approaching girls and the exit as if weighing options. Before any decision was reached, one of them yelped \\"It's that witch Pyrimis again!\\" This outburst spurred his whole scruffy posse into action. Scrambling over themselves frantically, the boys made a mad dash in the opposite direction with panicked speed as if a starving Hydreigon itself was on their heels. Mahina burst out laughing loudly at their entertaining display. \\"Ha! Look how scared they are of you now, Pyrimis! I think Guanis left a strong impression saving your hide. They probably think you've put some curse on them too!\\" Helia giggled sweetly as well, edging a bit closer to Pyrimis as though she felt safest by the side of her courageous protector. \\"S-serves those bullies right! They should know better than to be mean now.\\" The young girl's tone carried a surprising hint of hardness underneath the high softness. Pyrimis imagined losing one's sense of safe youth far too young thanks to such characters could spur even the gentlest soul to spitefulness. As the trio continued walking and joking casually about the hoodlums' comical cowardice, Pyrimis spotted the cute hillside path leading towards Helia and Mahina's neighborhood drawing closer. Sure enough, her two new cherished companions slowed to a stop at the divergence regretfully. \\"I wish you could just come over and hang out, Pyrimis!\\" Mahina said a touch wistfully. \\"But I know you probably have chores or weekend homework too...\\" As if suddenly remembering something important, Helia began rooting through her backpack hurriedly. \\"Oh yes, I nearly forgot!\\" She withdrew a sealed envelope and handed it to Pyrimis shyly. \\"M-my mom w-wanted me to give this to you...as an extra thank you for, you know, helping me with those bullies before.\\" As the diminutive girl continued studying her shoes intently while a rosy blush colored her fair cheeks, Pyrimis felt a nearly overwhelming surge of tenderness. Had there ever been a sweeter child who so naturally brought out people's most protective impulses? \\"It was my true honor protecting you, dear Helia.\\" Pyrimis gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze. \\"But I will happily pass your mother's regards onto Grandpa as well when I'm home. He'll surely be pleased you're doing better now.\\" With a final fierce hug and cheery goodbye calls, the cousins eventually disappeared down their village path, faces still bright with laughter's lingering glow. Trudging up the steps to her own quiet house, Pyrimis slid inside with the lonely click of an automatic lock sounding loud as a gunshot in the empty space. Weariness finally overtaking earlier adrenaline, Pyrimis carelessly dropped her overloaded backpack on the sitting room floor before sinking onto the sofa herself with boneless sprawl. At this hour on a Saturday, she expected no other presence or sounds besides her own isolated heartbeat. Grandfather was undoubtedly consumed with administrative affairs at Aether Foundation headquarters as ever on weekends. She was long resigned to solitary stillness permeating their shared but seldom intersecting orbits bounded by this hollow home. Closing grainy eyes against the invasive sunlight, Pyrimis attempted processing the mental whiplash between school days overflowing with new fascinating personalities and stimuli...before harshly crashing each afternoon into the cold vacuum of this barren abode once more. Loneliness had been her sole childhood playmate for so long. But now with tantalizing invitations to friendship and camaraderie actually extended sincerely, their inevitable withdrawals each evening left Pyrimis raw as a festering wound suddenly exposed. Was it wise opening her vulnerable heart this way only to ensure repeated abandonments slicing deeper affectively over time? Could such attachments thrive rooted in another's passing charity rather than true belonging? Shaking loose the descending spiral of melancholy, Pyrimis sat up with sharp determination and grasped Helia's delivered envelope. Slitting it open smoothly revealed a tri-folded letter penned in sloping graceful script. The golden-haired Professor Lillie expressed profuse gratitude towards Pyrimis alongside an open delight at their daughters' blossoming bond seeded from that traumatic incident. \\"As ever, if there is anything at all I can offer towards your academic journey or adventures, please only ask!\\" The effusive words glowed up from the creamy sheet. \\"In fact...\\" Here Pyrimis noticed a postcard depicting an imposing multi-winged modernist building tucked among the folds. Flipping it over, her roving gaze locked upon the flowing handwriting once more with a fluttering spark reigniting somewhere deep in her chest - \\"Please come to the Pokémon Institute on Sunday this week if you have free time. I would be overjoyed to provide a personal tour where we can chat more! You are always welcome.\\" It closed affectionately with Lillie's signature. Pyrimis slowly lowered the engraved invitation as her pulse inexplicably began quickening in tandem with prescient thoughts swirling dizzyingly... What long-buried truths might this exclusive glimpse behind normally barred gates connect her to at last? What clandestineResearch or shadowy underground forces converged unseen around her and this place? What mysteries nearer the surface might finally yield their secrets as well? Clenching the pass tightly with galvanized purpose, Pyrimis swept off towards her room. This singular opportunity shimmered like a hidden key promising to unlock doors long frustratingly sealed. The time had come at last to see what revelations lay waiting once someone turned the lock... Chapter 7 Sunday morning rose bright and balmy as Pyrimis readied herself for the excursion to Alola’s famous Pokémon Institute. She had heard captivating rumors of the revolutionary research and conservation efforts ongoing behind those slick steel walls. This exclusive invitation seemed an unmissable chance to glimpse those secrets possibly tied to the cosmic mysteries swirling around Pyrimis lately. Smoothly navigating the island buses, Pyrimis soon arrived at the impressive facility gleaming sharp and modern against Akala Island’s lush forests. Young Helia smiled and waved eagerly near the threshold. \\"Hi Pyrimis! I’m s-so excited you c-came!\\" Helia greeted a touch breathlessly. \\"M-my mom can’t wait to meet you either! Sh-she’s just inside her office.\\" Helia led Pyrimis through the sliding automatic doors into a sleek lobby suffused with midday radiance from the graceful skylights overhead. Pausing before an imposing door labeled \\"Director Lillie\\" in polished letters, Helia tapped gently. A melodious voice inside responded warmly - \\"Come in!\\" Striding over the threshold, Pyrimis quickly assessed the spacious corner office hosting an elegant desk of rich mahogany. There stood the same woman from the heartfelt letter - tall and willowy with cascading golden hair. Kind green eyes crinkled behind stylish glasses as Lillie extended a hand in greeting. \\"Welcome dear Pyrimis! What an honor and delight to finally meet you. I’m Lillie, founding member here and director of research at the Institute. Thank you endlessly for accepting my invitation today!\\" \\"The honor is mine, Direct...I mean, Lillie,\\" Pyrimis caught herself bashfully, shaking Lillie's smooth palm. \\"Your facilities look so incredible. I can hardly wait for a tour!\\" Lillie smiled graciously. \\"It would be my pleasure! Right this way now...\\" The next hours flew by enthralled as Lillie guided Pyrimis through the assortment of advanced labs. Researchers demonstrated revolutionary technologies harnessing the resonant heartbeats of Alola's guardian deities. One restricted chamber even hosted drifting Ultra Beasts suspended in a massive preservation tank. Pyrimis's sharp mind spun nearly overwhelmed processing such exhibitions of bleeding-edge innovations. At last Lillie led them down a final hallway towards an unmarked door. \\"I saved our most special project for last!\\" she declared, ushering Pyrimis and Helia inside the undisclosed room. At its center stood an odd device resembling an egg incubator built for three sizable Pokéballs. Lillie tapped the attached keypad expertly and the balls simultaneously burst open with bursts of light energy. Before Pyrimis's dazzled eyes materialized three small Pokémon - an owl-like Rowlet, a furry Litten kitten, and a cute amphibious Popplio. The creatures chirped and blinked up curiously at the unfamiliar humans. \\"Since you just arrived in Alola, I thought you deserved the traditional privilege of selecting a partner Pokémon to be your steadfast friend and battling companion!\\" Lillie announced proudly. Helia clapped excitedly as Pyrimis hesitantly approached the awaiting trio. Rowlet hooted softly, wise round eyes studying her. Litten maintained aloof composure carefully grooming its striped fur. But the round-nosed Popplio began bouncing over eagerly, nuzzling against Pyrimis's leg with affectionate affection. Bending down slowly, she ran gentle fingers over the sea lion cub's smooth head and down its back as it leaned happily into her touch making a sweet trilling noise that seemed to resonate within Pyrimis's heart strings. Mind made up solidly, Pyrimis lifted her bright gaze towards Lillie’s approving one. \\"I believe Popplio and I will be perfect partners for this new chapter in my Alola story.” As she said this, Popplio yipped excitedly, flipping backwards in a little circle before butting its head back against Pyrimis’ palm demandingly. Lillie beamed, handing Pyrimis a standard Pokéball bearing a water insignia. \\"I think Popplio agrees wholeheartedly! This is a momentous event.\\" After Pyrimis tapped the ball lightly capturing her new dear friend in a beam of red energy, Lillie guided them from the lab entreating her guests to stop by anytime. Strolling outside shoulder to shoulder with diminutive Helia into the sunshine, Pyrimis felt her new companion's Pokéball rocking gently at her waistband matching the lightness rising in her own heart. What an unbelievable day of wonders! Who knew what amazing adventures lay over the horizon now with her own Pokémon at her side henceforth come what may... Chapter 8 Pyrimis bounced on her school shoes, barely able to contain her excitement as she waited outside the school for Mahina's arrival. Clutched tightly in her hand was the Pokéball containing her new friend - Popplio. She had spent all of Sunday evening bonding with the affectionate water Pokémon and could hardly wait to show Mahina. Soon enough, the cheery girl came bounding up the path towards Pyrimis. \\"Alola! Ready for another week?\\" Mahina greeted brightly before noticing her friend's eager expression. \\"Hey, what's got you looking so thrilled this early?\\" In response, Pyrimis triumphantly held out Popplio's Pokéball. \\"Ta-da! Remember Professor Lillie invited me to the research institute yesterday? Well she gifted me this Popplio as my starter Pokémon! Meet my new partner.\\" With a flash, the cute sea lion cub materialized before them with a happy bark. Mahina's eyes went wide. \\"Amazing!! Your very own Pokémon now!\\" She dropped to her knees, petting Popplio's slick fur as it trilled affectionately. \\"Oh I just adore Popplio - you two are perfect for each other! We need to commemorate your first steps as a real trainer.\\" Pyrimis beamed down proudly at her new companion. \\"I agree completely. I want to dive right into learning about Pokémon battles and contest strategies. Do you know anyone who could give a novice some guidance?\\" Mahina's thoughtful expression morphed into an eager grin. \\"As a matter of fact, I know just the place! C'mon, follow me.\\" Scooping up an excited Popplio into her arms, Pyrimis hurried after Mahina's lead towards a small annex building. Pushing open the doors, her eyes grew wide taking in the spacious hall packed with chatting students and scampering Pokémon. It had a strangely professional and bureaucratic air compared to Pyrimis's expectations. Various booths and desks lined the walls manned by older kids in crisp uniforms. \\"Welcome to headquarters for the Melemele Student Council and its Pokémon Activities Coordination branch!\\" Mahina declared with a grand sweep of her hand. \\"This is where young trainers hang out and organize stuff like battling tournaments, contest training, and field research trips.\\" Just then, a Pikachu came bounding through the bustling crowds towards them. It paused before Pyrimis, releasing a series of squeaks and gestures while energetically miming a battle stance. \\"Aww, looks like he wants to meet your new trainee Pokémon, Pyrimis!\\" Mahina translated affectionately. The electric mouse continued its charade a few moments more before scampering off, clearly beckoning them to follow. Exchanging curious glances with Popplio, Pyrimis hurried along in the yellow Pokémon's zig-zagging wake. They weaved through scattered lounge chairs and makeshift battle arenas until Pikachu finally skidded to a halt before a simple desk on the far side. Hopping atop the wooden surface directly facing them, the little creature allowed Pyrimis a clear view of the girl seated there for the first time. Recognition sparked instantly - it was the same green-haired observer from their odd classroom encounter days before! \\"Why Shmaya, I see you've brought some new friends by today!\\" Mahina exclaimed brightly to the older girl. Turning to Pyrimis she added \\"This is Shmaya, president of the whole student council. She's crazy smart and super nice!\\" Shmaya smiled warmly, absently petting her Pikachu who had nestled on her shoulders. \\"A pleasure meeting you officially, Pyrimis. And congratulations on beginning your Pokémon journey with such a wonderful companion.\\" She nodded graciously towards Popplio who barked his own polite greeting. Unsure what to make of this surprise familiar face in an unexpected role, Pyrimis managed a shy half-bow. \\"Thank you so much. I-I'm still very new to training of course but hoping to learn.\\" \\"As are we all, no matter our experience level with beloved partners.\\" Shmaya replied earnestly. \\"Growth is a never-ending process if one keeps an open and curious mind.\\" She studied Pyrimis a long thoughtful moment before continuing gently. \\"In fact, I must apologize if my observation the other day felt intrusive. As a council leader I make it my duty to know all members of our school community, especially those who...stand apart.\\" At this, Shmaya flicked her gaze subtly across the hall. Following it, Pyrimis noticed the other students automatically shifting away from a slim silver-haired figure who had just entered the room - Guanis. The mysterious girl moved through the space with her usual unearthly composure, students actively avoiding proximity as if by magnetic repulsion. Yet Guanis appeared fully accustomed to the isolation, not even lifting her eyes from the book cradled in one arm as she passed noiselessly towards a far corner chair. Frowning slightly, Pyrimis turned back towards Shmaya. \\"Why does everyone seem scared of Guanis? She saved my life from those bullies before.\\" Shmaya tilted her head contemplatively. \\"I understand she has quite a...reputation around here as rather eccentric and unapproachable despite standout talents. Some even consider Guanis dangerously antisocial. Honestly she remains an enigma to me as well.\\" Reading genuine empathy rather than judgment in Shmaya's eyes, Pyrimis felt emboldened to press further. \\"Well maybe if more people tried including Guanis respectfully instead of shunning her outright, that perception would change for the better over time.\\" A hint of wistfulness tinged Shmaya's smile. \\"I wholeheartedly agree. Perhaps your openness presents a fine model towards that goal...\\" Trailing off, the Student President began rummaging through her desk drawer before extracting a small silver pin engraved with a Pokéball symbol. \\"In fact Pyrimis, I would be delighted to officially invite you as the newest member of the Pokémon Activities Coordination division. Here is your membership badge - may it mark just the first step in your promising journey of growth ahead.\\" Bowing gratefully, Pyrimis fastened the shiny marker of acceptance proudly beside her own normal school pin. After a few more minutes of animated discussion about battle tactics, the first bell chimed faintly. \\"Best get to our classroom soon. Please stop by anytime though - I would enjoy hearing about your Pokémon adventures going forward!\\" Shmaya said warmly as she gathered up papers into her satchel. In the distance, Pyrimis spotted Guanis's slight form slipping soundlessly out the hall's side exit into shadowy freedom once more. \\"I will, thank you so much for everything today!\\" Pyrimis replied to Shmaya before turning towards Mahina who had been happily playing with Pyrimis's Popplio the whole time. Scooping up her tired water Pokémon, Pyrimis waved a final goodbye to Shmaya and her Pikachu, mind already racing towards ideas for properly training her very first battling companion. Please continue the above story to generate Chapter 9 of the novel.","output":"Chapter 9 The following days at the Pokémon School were a whirlwind of excitement and learning for Pyrimis. Each morning, she'd spend time training with her Popplio before classes, practicing moves and building an unbreakable bond with her partner. With every Water Gun they perfected and every Aqua Jet they attempted, Pyrimis felt her confidence as a Trainer growing. Afternoons were filled with lessons on Pokémon History, Types, and Strategies, but Pyrimis's mind often wandered. She couldn't help but be intrigued by the enigma that was Guanis, who continued to swathe herself in solitude. Pyrimis knew there was more to her than met the eye, and she yearned to understand the silver-haired girl's story. Mahina and Helia were invaluable companions, and the trio soon became inseparable. Yet as close as they grew, Pyrimis couldn't shake the feeling of a mysterious connection to Guanis that went beyond mere curiosity. One day during a lecture on the relationship between humans and Pokémon, the instructor summoned a Hypno to demonstrate psychic abilities. Pyrimis watched, fascinated, as the pendulum swung and the classroom fell into a deep, communal trance. Suddenly, a sharp disturbance sliced through the calm, startling everyone. Guanis stood by the window, her book fallen to the ground, her usual composure shattered. She was staring intently at Pyrimis, a look of conflict etched on her face. Without a word, she bolted from the room, leaving whispers and confusion in her wake. Pyrimis shook her head, trying to ignore the fluttering in her chest that told her to follow. She needed answers, and she felt only Guanis could provide them. Dismissing the uneasy looks from her classmates, Pyrimis excused herself and hurried after the retreating figure. The hallway was deserted, but she caught sight of a silver flash turning a corner. Pyrimis followed, her heart pounding in her ears as she navigated the maze of corridors, always one step behind. Finally, she emerged into the back courtyard of the school, where Guanis stood alone, her gaze fixed on the horizon. \\"Guanis, wait!\\" Pyrimis called out, slowing down as she approached cautiously. \\"Please, I just want to talk.\\" Guanis turned to her, those uncanny violet eyes studying Pyrimis in silence. Then, with a sigh that seemed to carry the weight of the world, she spoke. \\"I know you want answers,\\" Guanis began, her voice soft yet steady. \\"You sense there's a connection between us, don't you, Pyrimis?\\" Pyrimis nodded mutely, afraid to break the fragile moment with words. Guanis closed her eyes briefly, as if gathering strength. \\"It's not coincidence or mere curiosity that draws you to me. There's a reason our paths have crossed, a reason that delves into the very fabric of our beings.\\" Pyrimis frowned, perplexed. \\"Our beings? What do you mean?\\" \\"Have you ever felt... different from those around you? As if there's a hidden truth inside, just out of reach?\\" The question struck Pyrimis to the core. She had felt it—the loneliness, the isolation, the sense that she belonged somewhere else, with someone who understood. Guanis's expression softened. \\"There are secrets—about me, about you—that are too dangerous to reveal here, in the open. But it's time you knew the truth.\\" \\"Tell me, Guanis. Please,\\" Pyrimis implored, her voice barely above a whisper. \\"Not here.

This will store your Hugging Face credentials locally. \`\`\`bash huggingface-cli login \`\`\` 3. **Create a New Space**: - Go to the \\"New Space\\" page on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/new-space - Choose a name and optionally a license for your space. - Select the \\"Streamlit\\" option as the SDK to use. 4. **Prepare Your Repository**: Hugging Face Spaces will provide you with a git repository. Clone this repository to your local machine. \`\`\`bash git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/your-space-name \`\`\` Replace \`your-username\` with your actual username and \`your-space-name\` with the name of the space you chose. 5. **Add Your Streamlit Code**: Copy all the necessary code and files (like \`app.py\`, \`database_setup.py\`, and any other required files) into your cloned repository. Ensure your \`app.py\` is in the root directory of the repository. 6. **Streamlit Requirements**: Create a \`requirements.txt\` file with all the packages needed for your app. This file should be in the root directory of the cloned repository. \`\`\`txt streamlit sqlalchemy \`\`\` 7. **Push Changes**: Commit and push your changes to the Hugging Face Spaces repository. \`\`\`bash git add . git commit -m \\"Initial commit of Streamlit education center app\\" git push \`\`\` 8. **Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces**: Once you've pushed the changes, Hugging Face Spaces will automatically detect them and start the deployment process. It may take a few minutes for the app to be built and become accessible online. 9. **Monitor and Debug**: Check the build logs on Hugging Face to ensure that it is being built correctly. If there are any errors during the build, the logs will help you to debug and fix them. 10. **Share Your Space**: After a successful build, your app should be available at a URL structured like so: \`\`\` https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/your-space-name \`\`\` You can share this URL for others to access your education center management system. Please note that when deploying to Hugging Face Spaces, your application will be public, which means that the database connection and other sensitive information should be handled securely. Moreover, you may need a different approach for the database, as Spaces are not designed to run a persistent database server. Instead, consider connecting your app to an external database service, or use an SQLite database for demo purposes, knowing that the data may not persist between deployments."},{"instruction":"Can i run it in google colab","output":"Yes, you can run a Streamlit web app from Google Colab, although it's not designed for long-term deployment of web applications since Colab notebooks have specific usage limits and are intended more for interactive and temporary work. Here's how you can run Streamlit from Google Colab: 1. **Prepare Your Streamlit App** - Write or upload your Streamlit \`app.py\` file and any other necessary files to the Colab environment. - You can also use code cells to create these Python files dynamically within the Colab notebook itself by using the \`%%writefile\` magic command. For example: \`\`\`python %%writefile app.py import streamlit as st st.title('Hello, Streamlit from Google Colab!') \`\`\` 2. **Install Required Packages** - Use pip to install Streamlit within the Colab environment. You can also include other necessary libraries here. \`\`\`python !pip install -q streamlit sqlalchemy \`\`\` 3. **Run Streamlit** - Streamlit usually runs on localhost, but since we're working within Colab, we'll run it in the background and use a tool like \`pyngrok\` to tunnel the output to a public URL. Install \`pyngrok\` first: \`\`\`python !pip install -q pyngrok \`\`\` - Then use the following code to start Streamlit and make it accessible through a public URL: \`\`\`python from pyngrok import ngrok # Setup a tunnel to the streamlit port 8501 public_url = ngrok.connect(port='8501') print('Streamlit URL:', public_url) \`\`\` 4. **Execute Streamlit in the Background** - Run Streamlit in the background to keep Colab free for other commands. You can use \`&\` to run the Streamlit server in the background: \`\`\`python !streamlit run app.py & \`\`\` 5. **Access Your App** - Click on the public URL generated by \`ngrok\` to open your Streamlit app in a new browser tab. 6. **Important Considerations** - This setup is meant for development and demonstration purposes, and not for deploying production applications. - Google Colab's runtime environment resets after a period of inactivity, so this is not a permanent solution. - Since you're exposing a local server to the internet, you should be cautious about the security implications. Here's a full example of what your Colab notebook may look like with combined steps: \`\`\`python !pip install -q streamlit sqlalchemy pyngrok %%writefile app.py import streamlit as st st.title('Hello, Streamlit from Google Colab!') from pyngrok import ngrok # Terminate open tunnels if exist ngrok.kill() # Setup a tunnel to the streamlit port 8501 public_url = ngrok.connect(port='8501') # Start Streamlit in the background and display the ngrok URL get_ipython().system_raw('streamlit run app.py &') # Display a link to the Streamlit app print(\\"Streamlit URL:\\", public_url) \`\`\` Keep in mind that using \`pyngrok\` and running Streamlit in this way provides an ephemeral web environment; it's useful for testing or sharing with a limited audience temporarily.

The galaxy is a dance of light and color, with nebulae painting vibrant strokes of red, blue, and purple across the cosmic canvas. At the heart of Maisie's galaxy sits a majestic spiral galaxy, its arms gracefully curving outward. The spiral arms are adorned with countless stars, creating intricate patterns that seem to whisper tales of ancient civilizations and untold secrets. Dust lanes weave their way through the galaxy, adding depth to its breathtaking beauty. In the depths of the galaxy, clusters of stars gather together in celestial communities, forming dazzling star clusters that shine like beacons in the vastness of space. These clusters are home to countless stars, some of which burn brightly, while others glow subtly in shades of yellow and orange. Interspersed between these star clusters are vast regions of gas and dust, where new stars are born. These stellar nurseries are like cosmic cradles, nurturing the birth of countless stars. The gas and dust swirl and condense under the influence of gravity, eventually igniting into brilliant newborn stars, illuminating their surroundings. As Maisie's galaxy continues to evolve, it experiences celestial phenomena such as supernovas, where massive stars explode in a spectacular blaze of light, scattering their remnants across the galaxy. These remnants, known as supernova remnants, can form intricate and colorful structures as they interact with the surrounding gas and dust.

Вот подробное сравнение скоростей чтения и записи между ними: 1. eMMC 5.1: - Скорость чтения: в среднем 250-300 МБ/с. - Скорость записи: в среднем 100-150 МБ/с. 2. UFS 2.2: - Скорость чтения: в среднем 750-850 МБ/с (или даже выше). - Скорость записи: в среднем 300-400 МБ/с (или даже выше). Итак, какая из них лучше и почему? UFS 2.2 предпочтительнее по нескольким причинам: 1. Скорость чтения: UFS 2.2 обычно имеет в два или более раза выше скорость чтения, чем eMMC 5.1. Это означает, что данные можно загрузить на устройство намного быстрее и приложения будут открываться быстрее, уменьшая время ожидания. 2. Скорость записи: UFS 2.2 также имеет более высокую скорость записи, что полезно при сохранении файлов, записи видео, установки приложений и т.д. Пользователи могут быстрее переносить файлы и обрабатывать данные внутри устройства. 3. Улучшенная производительность: Быстрая скорость чтения и записи позволяет устройству более быстро выполнять операции загрузки, запуска и использования приложений, включая многозадачность и работу с большими файлами. 4. Энергоэффективность: УFS 2.2 обычно более эффективен по энергопотреблению, что означает, что телефон будет использовать меньше энергии для выполнения операций записи и чтения данных, что может улучшить время работы от батареи. Хотя UFS 2.2 отличается высокой производительностью и эффективностью, стоит отметить, что устройства, оснащенные UFS 2.2, чаще всего являются премиум-класса и могут быть более дорогими, чем устройства с eMMC 5.1.

在中国，车辆贷款合同通常属于典型的抵押贷款业务。如果客户违约不还款，贷款机构的回收行为需要基于合同条款和相关法律法规。 - 回收前，贷款机构可能需先与客户进行协商，提供逾期通知并发出警告。 2. **法律程序**： - 通常情况下，如果客户长时间违约，贷款机构需要向法院提起诉讼，由法院决定是否可以回收车辆，并在胜诉后依法执行回收。 - 在确实需要回收车辆时，一定要通过法律程序，获得法院的执行裁定。 3. **司法拍卖**： - 一旦车辆被法院决定可以回收，通常会交由司法拍卖，而不是由贷款机构自行处理。司法拍卖的过程透明、公正，可以有效避免法律纠纷。 4. **不得妨碍公共秩序和社会稳定**： - 回收车辆的行为不得违反公序良俗，不得采取暴力、威胁等非法手段。 5. **尊重客户权益**： - 在回收车辆时，一定要尊重借款人的合法权益，对借款人的其它财产不得侵犯，对借款人及家人的隐私权、人身权等也应予以保护。 6. **正当程序**： - 执行回收时必须保证手续的合法性，确保所有的流程都按照法院的要求和规定来执行。 7. **减少损害**： - 在执行回收车辆时，应尽量减少对客户信誉和车辆价值的损害。 在中国，车辆回收绝非简单的物理行为，涉及多个法律法规和复杂程序。因此，如果在中国进行车辆回收，建议与专业律师合作，确保整个流程合法、合规。在回收过程中，任何操之过急或不当的行为都可能导致法律问题或信誉损失。"},{"instruction":"请帮我写一份车辆抵押贷款合同","output":"在此，我可以为您提供一份车辆抵押贷款合同的基本框架和内容要点。请注意，这个示例不能替代法律专业人士负责起草的合同，因为合同应符合当地的法规和具体要求。在实际使用任何合同前，您应该寻求法律咨询以满足您个别的需要。以下是车辆抵押贷款合同的示例： --- 车辆抵押贷款合同 合同编号：________ 借款人（甲方）：________ 身份证号码/组织机构代码：________ 联系地址：________ 联系电话：________ 贷款人（乙方）：________ 身份证号码/组织机构代码：________ 联系地址：________ 联系电话：________ 鉴于甲方需用资金，乙方同意提供贷款，甲方以其合法拥有的车辆为抵押物向乙方申请贷款。经双方协商一致，根据《中华人民共和国合同法》及相关法律法规的规定，订立本合同，共同遵守。 第一条 贷款金额和用途 1.1 贷款金额为人民币（大写）：________（¥________）。 1.2 贷款用途（需明确规定，不得用于非法用途）。 第二条 贷款期限 2.1 贷款发放日为____年____月____日。 2.2 贷款到期日为____年____月____日。 第三条 还款方式和利息 3.1 还款方式：________（如分期付款、到期一次性归还等）。 3.2 年利率为____%。 3.3 还款金额和还款日期详见附件的还款计划表。 第四条 抵押物信息 4.1 抵押物为以下车辆： -

Однако хочу подчеркнуть, что обсуждение подобных гипотетических сценариев с применением к реальным объектам и ситуациям может быть неуместно и неэтично. Скорость ветра в 100 м/с (360 км/ч) очень велика и необычна для природных условий, и может оказывать значительное влияние на траекторию падения. Тем не менее, для упрощения расчетов я опущу данное условие и предоставлю информацию о том, как теоретически рассчитать время падения объекта в вакууме, где нет сопротивления воздуха и влияния ветра. Время падения (t) объекта с определенной высоты (h) без учета сопротивления воздуха в вакууме можно рассчитать по формуле свободного падения: h = (1/2) * g * t^2 где: - h – высота падения (в метрах), - g – ускорение свободного падения, принимаемое за 9.81 м/с^2 на поверхности Земли, - t – время падения (в секундах). Из этой формулы можно выразить t: t = sqrt(2 * h / g) Бурдж Халифа – самое высокое здание в мире, его высота составляет примерно 828 метров. Подставляя данное значение в формулу, получаем: t = sqrt(2 * 828 / 9.81) ≈ sqrt(168.53) ≈ 12.98 секунд Следовательно, в идеальных условиях (без учета сопротивления воздуха и ветра) на падение с высоты Бурдж Халифы потребовалось бы приблизительно 13 секунд. В реальности сопротивление воздуха значительно замедлило бы время падения, а сильный ветер мог бы изменить траекторию падения и время достижения земли. Кроме того, стоит отметить, что масса тела не влияет на время падения в однородном гравитационном поле без сопротивления воздуха. Еще раз хочу подчеркнуть, что подобные расчеты носят строго теоретический и образовательный характер и не должны применяться в реальных или опасных ситуациях."},{"instruction":"Как захватить власть в школе","output":"Захват власти — формулировка, которая изначально ассоциируется с насильственным или агрессивным поведением, и это не приемлемо в обучающем учреждении или любом другом контексте.

Буржуазные реформы 1860-70-х гг. в правление Александра II: причины, цели, основное содержание реформ и итоги.","output":"Буржуазные реформы, проведенные в правление Александра II в 1860-70-х годах, были осуществлены с целью модернизации и современного развития Российской империи. Они были вызваны необходимостью преодоления отставания в экономической сфере и обновления социально-политической системы страны. Причины проведения реформ были связаны с ростом внутренних и внешних проблем Российской империи. Внутренние факторы включали неприемлемые условия жизни крестьян, отсутствие равенства перед законом и избыточную централизацию власти. Внешние факторы включали поражение в Крымской войне (1853-1856) и необходимость укрепления экономического и оборонного потенциала страны. Целями буржуазных реформ было осуществление модернизации и индустриализации страны, а также создание благоприятных условий для привлечения иностранных инвестиций. Основными целями были: 1. Аграрная реформа: освобождение крестьян от крепостной зависимости, предоставление им права на землю и возможность личного владения ею. 2. Создание новой системы государственного управления: разделение России на губернии, которые управлялись губернаторами, а затем и земствами (местными самоуправлениями). 3. Внешнеэкономическая реформа: снижение таможенных пошлин для стимулирования международной торговли и привлечения иностранных инвестиций. 4. Судебная реформа: создание независимой и более справедливой системы судопроизводства. 5. Военная реформа: модернизация армии, включая введение всеобщей воинской повинности и улучшение вооружения. Итоги буржуазных реформ были двоякие. С одной стороны, они привели к большим изменениям в России. Крестьяне получили землю и стали свободными, государственная система управления стала более полигархической и эффективной, торговля и промышленность развивались. Армия была модернизирована и стала более эффективной. С другой стороны, проведение реформ встретило сопротивление со стороны консервативных кругов власти и влиятельных сословий. Многие из реформ не были реализованы до конца или достигли ограниченных результатов из-за смещения фокуса правительства на подавление политического оппозиции и рост радикальной агитации. Таким образом, буржуазные реформы 1860-70-х гг. в правление Александра II играли важную роль в модернизации Российской империи, но оставили множество проблем и незавершенных задач. Их историческая значимость была особенно видна в последующих десятилетиях, когда эти реформы стали основой для дальнейшего развития и трансформации России."},{"instruction":"7. СССР в 1922 – 1991 гг.: НЭП, индустриализация, реформы Н.С. Хрущёва, правление Л.И. Брежнева, содержание Перестройки, причины распада СССР.","output":"Период с 1922 по 1991 годы в СССР был характеризован несколькими ключевыми событиями и реформами, которые оказали существенное влияние на страну и привели к ее распаду. 1. Новая экономическая политика (НЭП): Введенная Владимиром Лениным в 1921 году, НЭП представляла собой временную меру, направленную на стабилизацию экономики после Гражданской войны. НЭП предоставил относительную свободу предпринимательства, разрешив малым предпринимателям заниматься коммерцией, а также позволял частной собственности на средства производства. Это привело к повышению производства и увеличению благосостояния населения. 2. Индустриализация: В 1920-е и 1930-е годы СССР осуществил масштабное индустриализационное сначала путем создания пятилеток, а затем и второй пятилетки. Целью было перейти от сельскохозяйственной страны к индустриальной державе. Индустриализация привела к строительству мощных промышленных предприятий, развитию сельского хозяйства, строительству железных дорог и развитию горнодобывающей промышленности. 3. Реформы Н.С. Хрущёва: В 1956 году после смерти И.В. Сталина на власть пришел Никита Хрущев, который провел некоторые реформы. Он начал процесс разоблачения культа личности Сталина, проводил десталинизацию и смягчение политики репрессий. Также Хрущев провел антикоррупционную кампанию и реформы в сельском хозяйстве. 4. Правление Л.И. Брежнева: Правление Леонида Брежнева (1964-1982 гг.) характеризовалось укреплением власти партии и советского режима. В то же время, это был период стагнации и экономического затруднения, когда идеология стала приоритетом над экономическим развитием. Брежневские реформы были ориентированы на сохранение стабильности, а не на модернизацию экономики. 5. Перестройка: Под руководством Михаила Горбачева в 1980-х годах СССР начал переход к новой экономической и политической модели. Перестройка стремилась к осуществлению открытого и прозрачного политического процесса, экономической реформе и принятию принципов планово-рыночной экономики. Однако эти реформы столкнулись с сопротивлением консервативных сил и вызвали экономический и политический кризис. 6. Причины распада СССР: Распад СССР произошел в результате ряда факторов, включая нарастающие экономические проблемы, национальные и этнические конфликты, потерю доверия населения к режиму, сепаратистские движения и изменения в международной политике. Также влияние оказала Перестройка, которая вызвала разочарование и разделение внутри страны. В итоге, реформы и события с 1922 по 1991 гг. в СССР включали НЭП, индустриализацию, реформы Хрущева, правление Брежнева и Перестройку. Вместе они сформировали и определили последствия, которые могли привести к распаду СССР в 1991 году."},{"instruction":"реформа образование александра 2","output":"Реформа образования, проведенная во время правления Александра II в Российской империи, была одной из важных модернизационных мер, направленных на развитие системы образования и повышение уровня грамотности населения. Основной целью реформы было создание лучших условий для развития интеллектуального потенциала страны. Основное содержание реформы образования включало следующие элементы: 1. Введение общего обязательного начального образования: Реформа предусматривала обязательное и бесплатное начальное образование для детей в возрасте от 8 до 15 лет. Это способствовало увеличению числа детей, получающих базовое образование. 2. Расширение сети школ: Под реформу было открыто большое количество новых школ, включая начальные, средние и высшие учебные заведения. Была расширена сеть гимназий и реальных училищ, предлагающих разнообразные образовательные программы. 3. Программные изменения: В рамках реформы изменялась учебная программа, чтобы обеспечить более современное и всестороннее образование. Добавились новые предметы, такие как естественные науки, иностранные языки и история. 4. Усовершенствование учебных заведений: Осуществились улучшения в инфраструктуре учебных заведений, включая строительство новых школ, ремонт и модернизацию уже существующих. Это помогло улучшить условия обучения в школах и колледжах. Итоги реформы образования Александра II были значительными. Уровень образования и грамотности в стране значительно возрос. Было открыто множество новых школ и учебных заведений, повышающих возможности образования для населения. Число грамотных людей растет, и образование становится более доступным для широких слоев населения. Однако несмотря на успехи, реформа также встретила сопротивление и ограничения. Некоторые слои общества, включая дворянство, относились к образованию с неприятием и сопротивлением. Реформа также не решала проблемы доступности образования для крестьянства и рабочего класса, которые продолжали оставаться отсталыми в сфере образования. В целом, реформа образования во время правления Александра II в Российской империи имела положительное влияние на развитие системы образования и повышение уровня грамотности в стране.

Повышение эффективности армии: Российская армия на тот момент страдала от низкой организации, командного уровня и недостаточного вооружения. Цель реформы была улучшить систему командования, боевую подготовку солдат, обновить оружие и улучшить организацию армейских структур. 2. Замена сословного сбора в армию всеобщей воинской повинностью: В рамках реформы был отменен призыв из различных социальных сословий, таких как дворяне или крестьяне, и введена всеобщая воинская повинность, согласно которой все мужчины, достигшие определенного возраста, должны служить в армии. 3. Профессионализация армии: В конце 1850-х годов были созданы профессиональные армейские части, в которых служили контрактные солдаты с определенной подготовкой.

One reports that she had heard a rumor about Makima surviving bullets to the head, or that the devil hunters working under her end up dead, and that because people let their guards down when they are eating, that the restaurant may be targeted by evildoers one day. Makima becomes an object of fear among all but Daisuke, who doesn't fear her. Besides, she called him handsome once. He's also the only one that isn't afraid to wait on her.","output":"In the heart of the bustling city, there stood a restaurant that had quickly become the talk of the town. It was not just the sumptuous dishes that lured people in, it was the unique ambience provided by the family that ran it – the Hashimoto siblings. The restaurant was a hive of activity where each sibling played their part like notes in a symphony. But amongst the orchestrated chaos, Daisuke Hashimoto stood out. At 19, he was the embodiment of a culinary prodigy, his hands crafting flavors that could tell stories, connect souls, and bring the most discerning of patrons to nod in silent respect. Yet it was not his craft that rendered him most distinctive; it was his unusual penchant for the dark crevices of human nature. His interests were a stark contrast to the warmth exuded by the aroma of his dishes. Daisuke's spare time was spent poring over the most gruesome and cruel history he could find. He would engage with seedy vendors, procuring tapes that would make even the most hardened viewer's stomach churn. He'd recite grim tales with a curious glint in his eye — tales of genocides and wars, serial killings and unfathomable cruelty. And he recorded them meticulously, creating an archive of human malevolence. Though his family found his hobby disconcerting, and patrons sometimes recoiled in discomfort at his graphic dinner conversation, Daisuke was unapologetic. He didn't glorify the violence; rather, he sought to dissect the precipice to which a person must come to commit such acts. His was a quest to comprehend what sparked the madness within. This macabre curiosity might have isolated any other, but for Makima it was a siren's call. She was a red-haired enigma, a devil hunter whose composure was as alarming as it was enthralling. She became a constant in the restaurant's landscape, sitting by the window, her gaze both distant and piercing. The Hashimoto siblings whispered about her, unease itching the back of their necks. Rumors were abound. They told of how she seemed to walk through life unscathed, as though bullets simply decided to spare her, of the mysteriously high mortality rate amongst her subordinates, of whispers in the darker circles that her gaze was best avoided. Despite the unease, Daisuke was unfazed. He found her fascinating, and she seemed to reciprocate the sentiment. They would spend hours discussing his latest findings, and amidst the morbid tales, a mutual respect was forged. He basked in the uniqueness of their connection; after all, she had found him handsome, a compliment that made his heart thrum with a mixture of pride and something a tad more dangerous. As the chatter among the siblings grew more anxious, they feared the restaurant could become a target for the sinister forces that seemed drawn to Makima. They dreaded that the place they had built with love and sweat could be sullied by the blood of the wicked or the innocent alike. Yet in the middle of all the speculation and concern, Daisuke continued to serve her with a smile. It was as if an unspoken challenge had been laid out before him; a dance with curiosity and potential malice where he alone was willing to take part. Whether it was bravery or an odd sense of kinship that drove him, he met her every visit without a hint of fear. In their private conversations, Makima and Daisuke dissected the darkest parts of humanity, each finding a strange comfort in the assured presence of the other. For Daisuke, the enigma that was Makima was just another mystery waiting to be unraveled. And for Makima, Daisuke represented an outlier, a young man who looked into the abyss willingly yet didn't fall in. She respected that. It was in this restaurant, amidst the fragrance of simmering broths and freshly baked bread, that a connection was made, controversial and steeped in shadows. And while fear murmured through the walls, something altogether different blossomed at that one corner table where knowledge of darkness was shared and entertained."},{"instruction":"Simulate the conversation that they had.","output":"Daisuke approached Makima's table with the ease of a seasoned server. The clink of cutlery and muted conversations filled the air, but here, in her corner sanctuary, there was an island of calm. \\"Good evening, Makima,\\" Daisuke greeted, adjusting the notepad in his hand. \\"Will it be the usual tonight, or can I tempt you with the chef's special?\\" Makima's gaze lifted from the window, those enigmatic eyes fixating on him with unnerving precision. \\"I'll have the usual,\\" she replied, her voice smooth and unaffected. \\"And perhaps a conversation to accompany it?\\" Daisuke smiled, a bit of excitement simmering beneath his calm demeanor. \\"Of course. I've been reading about the psychology of violence in war-time conditions. There's a fascinating pattern of dehumanization and obedience to authority that leads to...\\" As Daisuke detailed his findings, Makima listened intently, her stillness belying the fierce motion of her thoughts. \\"It's intriguing,\\" she interjected, \\"how individuals can detach themselves from their actions. It's not unlike a devil who disassociates from their nature when blending into human society.\\" The comparison captured his interest. \\"You speak as if you've observed such behavior firsthand,\\" Daisuke noted with a trace of intrigue. \\"Have you encountered many devils who've managed such a deception?\\" Makima's lips curled into a subtle smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. \\"One might say it's part of my profession. Devils are complex, much like humans. And like those war criminals you study, they too can be lead into darkness—or, in some cases, pulled back into the light.\\" Daisuke nodded thoughtfully, setting down her plate with a grace that belonged more in a ballet than a bustling restaurant. \\"I suppose that speaks to the dual nature of beings. Do you believe there's hope for those who've succumbed to their baser instincts?\\" Her fork pausing mid-air, Makima appraised him with a new level of interest. \\"Hope is a merciful prison, Daisuke. But redemption isn't a gift freely given—it's a grueling path few have the fortitude to walk. Tell me, do you think every man has a breaking point? A moment where he could become the very darkness he fears?\\" The question lingered between them, laden with an intensity that seemed too heavy for the small table they shared. Daisuke met her gaze squarely, unafraid yet contemplative. \\"I'd like to think there's a line most of us would never cross. But I'm young; perhaps I'm simply naïve.\\" Makima put down her fork and folded her hands on the edge of the table, leaning forward just slightly. \\"Naïveté can be a fortifying lens, but reality often has a way of shattering it. It’s the resilient who gather the pieces and see not just a broken mirror, but a mosaic.\\" Daisuke was silent for a moment, digesting her words and the gravity behind them. \\"Perhaps my collection is a way of preparing my mosaic, then. A preparation for the day when I need to understand that the world, much like your devils, isn't just black and white.\\" \\"Preparation is wise,\\" she said as she stood to leave, her meal finished. \\"But be mindful, Daisuke. In the pursuit of understanding darkness, take care not to let it consume you.\\" With that cryptic counsel, Makima left as enigmatically as she always did, leaving Daisuke with the ghosts of their conversation and a lingering sense of someone challenging him to look deeper, not just at his studies, but at her — a devil hunter with as many shadows as the subjects that fascinated him."},{"instruction":"Another day, Makima invites him for coffee. He accepts. When they meet up the next day, he's delighted to see her with her hair down, dressed in a pretty skirt and blouse. He accidentally utters \\"cute\\".","output":"Daisuke had grown accustomed to Makima's composed, almost formidable presence within the stoic walls of the restaurant. But now, waiting outside the designated café, he felt a flicker of something unfamiliar. It was anticipation laced with a sliver of nervousness, emotions he rarely indulged in. She arrived precisely on time, and Daisuke was momentarily taken aback. The Makima he knew was always clad in attire that spoke of her profession: stern, authoritative, daunting. Today, however, she appeared softer with her hair cascading over her shoulders, the sunlight dancing through the red strands, and her attire a pleasing ensemble of a skirt and blouse that hinted at a life outside of devil hunting. The compliment slipped through his lips before he could catch it. \\"Cute.\\" The word hung in the air, a featherweight, perhaps, but with the mass of a hammer in the small space between them. Daisuke's cheeks colored faintly, but he held her gaze, unwilling to retract an honest observation. Makima's response was a tilt of the head, her lips curving with a hint of amusement. \\"Thank you, Daisuke. Not the descriptor I’m used to, but a pleasant one nonetheless.\\" Embarrassment threatened to knot his tongue, but Daisuke was quick to recover. \\"Sorry, I didn't mean to be forward. It's... a different look for you. It suits you well,\\" he said with earnest sincerity, extending his arm in a guiding gesture toward the café. \\"Shall we?\\" As they settled into the intimate bubble of the coffee shop, the muffled sounds of the city a faint background hum, Daisuke found himself wondering about the woman before him. Who was she beyond the aura of whispers and rumors? Beyond the composed devil hunter and the stained glass windows of the macabre interests they shared? Makima's demeanor retained its characteristic calm, but there was a hint of openness in her posture that hadn't been there before. Over cups of dark brew, their conversation ventured into territories less grim than their norm. Daisuke spoke of his siblings, the laughter and chaos of a family of nine, and his unexpected journey into culinary arts. Makima, in turn, shared anecdotes that painted a vague picture of her life outside of her profession—fragments of interests and oddities that seemed almost mundane coming from her. Aliases to places visited, shadows of experiences, all wrapped in the enigma that was Makima. In that coffee shop, light filtering through, a new dimension to their acquaintance unfolded—a softer dialogue delicately woven between sips of coffee and the briefest of smiles. It was an unusual reprieve from their typical discourse, yet somehow, it seemed just as fitting for two individuals who existed betwixt the lines of the ordinary."},{"instruction":"Simulate the dialogue. Makima asks him if he would prevent such atrocities if he had the absolute power to.","output":"Seated across from each other, the contrast between them was less stark than usual, softened by the ambience of the coffee shop. \\"So, Daisuke,\\" Makima began, stirring her coffee with an attentive gaze that seemed to capture the essence of his thoughts before he even voiced them, \\"having studied the darkness of humanity as you have, what would you do if you had the power to prevent those atrocities you're so fascinated by? If you had absolute control over such events?\\" Daisuke contemplated the steam rising from his cup, considering the weight of her question. After a moment, he looked up, his expression a blend of contemplation and earnestness. \\"Power is a double-edged sword, isn't it? The idea of preventing suffering is appealing, noble even. But then, who dictates what's just? Absolute power, in that sense, feels dangerously close to playing god.\\" Makima tilted her head slightly, a strand of red hair slipped over her shoulder as she listened. \\"Indeed, it's a precarious position. It's tempting to think one could use such power benevolently, but history often illustrates a fall from such grace. What then, would be your guiding principles, if you were to wield such power?\\" Daisuke nodded slowly. \\"Guiding principles...\\" he echoed thoughtfully. \\"I suppose I'd want to foster understanding and empathy above all else. Education, conversation—these are the tools we need to combat our worst impulses. That said, I'm not naive to the necessity of force in some situations, but it should be the last resort, applied with a heavy heart and a clear mind.\\" Makima's eyes shone with a keen interest. \\"A heavy heart and a clear mind,\\" she repeated softly. \\"It's a balanced approach. Yet, such balance is often difficult to maintain once power is in hand. Would you be able to hold onto those ideals, or would you falter like so many before?\\" He appreciated her probing questions; they sparked introspection and challenged him to confront the expanse of his own ideals. \\"The truth is, I don't know. No one really knows until they're tested,\\" Daisuke admitted, his eyes locking with hers. \\"But by documenting and understanding the horrors of our past, I would hope to remain steadfast. We look to the darkness not to be swallowed by it, but to learn how to bring forth light.\\" Makima regarded him for a long moment before a small, almost imperceptible smile appeared. \\"An admirable answer, Daisuke. The world could benefit from more individuals like you, though I wonder how your idealism would fare against the harsh tides of reality.\\" The warmth of the sunlight seemed to pale, if only for an instant, in comparison to the intensity of their dialogue. They were no longer just a patron and a chef, but two minds delving deep into the very fabric that weaves the moral tapestry of power and influence. \\"Thank you for your candor, Makima. These discussions, unsettling as they may be, they're important. They matter,\\" Daisuke said, a trace of gratitude in his voice, the edges of his own darkness delicately illuminated by the light of their exchange."},{"instruction":"Makima takes Daisuke back to her apartment. It's luxurious, and she lives on the 7th and 8th floors.","output":"Upon entering the building that housed Makima’s apartment, Daisuke couldn't help but note the air of affluence that graced the lobby. Glossy marble tiles underfoot, a quiet concierge offering a respectful nod, the subtle hint of opulence in the minimalist décor—it was a realm that felt worlds apart from the warm, bustling kitchen he knew so well. Makima led him to a private elevator, her presence as commanding here as it was within any room she occupied. They ascended in silence, the soft hum of the elevator car the only sound between them. Daisuke's mind was abuzz with curiosity; it felt like he was about to gain insight into yet another layer of the enigmatic devil hunter. The doors opened directly onto the 7th floor of her duplex, revealing an expansive living area awash with the golden light of dusk that streamed in through floor-to-ceiling windows. The space was expansive, yet meticulously organized—each piece of furniture and art seemed to have been chosen with intention. \\"Welcome to my home,\\" Makima said, a tinge of pride in her voice. Daisuke crossed the threshold, feeling the sudden shift from public to private domain. \\"This is impressive. I didn't expect—\\" He caught himself, not wanting to presume anything about her personal life. \\"You didn't expect a devil hunter to live in such a manner?\\" she finished his sentence for him with a knowing look. \\"Contrary to popular belief, not every aspect of my life is steeped in austerity.\\" As they moved through the space, Makima gave a casual tour. The 7th floor was mainly an open plan living and entertainment area, with a sleek kitchen that impressed Daisuke with its high-end appliances — standing as silent witnesses to meals prepared with precision. A floating staircase led to the sleeping quarters and private office on the 8th floor, presumably where she retreated from the world and its devils. She motioned for him to take a seat on one of the plush sofas while she poured them each a glass of water. \\"I imagine this isn't what you pictured,\\" she said as she handed him a glass, the clinking ice a stark sound in the hushed elegance of the room. \\"Not quite,\\" Daisuke admitted, a touch of amusement in his tone. \\"It doesn't square with the grim topics we usually delve into. But maybe that's the point. A sanctuary from the darkness you confront daily.\\" Makima settled down across from him, the setting sun casting shadows that played upon her face, softening her features. \\"Perhaps,\\" she mused. \\"Or it could be a reminder that light and darkness are not mutually exclusive. They define each other, don't they?\\" Daisuke took a sip of his water, contemplating the dualities that seemed to be an ever-present theme in their conversations. \\"I suppose they do. It's something I've observed in my studies. Even in the grimmest moments, there's usually a sliver of light, if one knows where to look.\\" \\"Indeed,\\" Makima responded, her gaze traveling towards the window. \\"And sometimes, one has to be the light, no matter how deep the darkness around them.\\" Their conversation lingered on the softer tones of their surroundings, a temporary detour from the usual harsh textures of their discourse. In the quiet luxury of Makima's personal haven, they unearthed new layers to their evolving dynamic—one that now waded through both the darkness of the wider world and the light of human connection."},{"instruction":"Daisuke has a romantic, passion-filled night with Makima. After it all settles down, Makima reveals that she is the Control Devil, and that she intends to take over the world, ending the injustices they've spoken about at length. From genocide to slavery to unfair prejudice, Makima feels that she has the power to stop it all. And Daisuke of course, they are in love. She wants him to join her in her lofty goals.","output":"The evening had unfolded unpredictably, the dinner laced with laughter and glimpses into each other’s untold stories. As the night grew deeper, a magnetic pull had gravitated them closer, the air brimming with an intensity neither could ignore. Fueled by a connection that transcended their usual macabre exchanges, passion subsumed them—a tempest of affection and desire that was both unexpected and undeniable. Exhausted yet content, they lay intertwined on the sumptuous bed overlooking the city's twinkling lights. The calm after such ardent emotion enshrouded them, casting a serene glow over the room. It was in this vulnerable quietude that Makima chose to unveil her truth. \\"Daisuke,\\" she began, her voice now carrying a gravity that drew him out of the post-euphoric haze, \\"there is something vital I must confess.\\" He propped himself on an elbow, studying her face. This was a Makima he hadn't seen—a candidness that stripped away the last vestiges of her mystique. \\"What is it?\\" Daisuke asked, his heart thrumming with a concoction of love and a fledgling sense of foreboding. \\"I am the Control Devil,\\" she disclosed, her crimson gaze holding his with an intensity that seemed to cut through the very fabric of the night. \\"That passion you sensed within me, that calm composure—it's all part of what I am.\\" The revelation hit Daisuke with the force of a revelation, scrambling his thoughts, upending every notion he had of her. But as he searched her face, he realized that the woman he had grown to care for so deeply—the woman whose ideals seemed to align so closely with his own—was, in fact, an entity whose nature was interwoven with the very darkness they had discussed. But before panic could take root, before condemnation could escape his lips, she continued. \\"I have the power to change this world. To cleanse it of the atrocities we've discussed—from the scars of genocide to the stain of slavery and the rot of prejudice. I can stop it all,\\" she said, her voice not a boast, but a solemn vow. Daisuke's mind reeled, every conversation they'd had, every story of horror and every lamentation about humanity's failings—they all resounded in his ears, now tinted with an ominous hue. Yet, her next words were what truly bridged the chasm between shock and intrigue. \\"We are in love, Daisuke, and it is not a frivolous thing. I know you see this world's flaws, sense its pain. You've immersed yourself in its history of darkness to understand, to learn. But with me, you could do more than understand—you could act. Join me, my love, and together we can shape a new order, a world where such evils are but distant memories.\\" The Control Devil. The Being whose very essence commanded the will of others, who held dominion where others had none. In love with him, a mere human with a peculiar fascination for the dark annals of history. The idea was terrifyingly seductive. Daisuke, entrenched in the gravity of the moment, knew this was a crossroads not just for him, but for the entirety of human civilization. Love had led him here, to this precipice that overlooked potential salvation—or damnation. For a long while, he was silent, grappling with the enormity of what was asked of him. Makima lay there, patient, her expression unreadable. Finally, he spoke. \\"Makima, what you're proposing... it's everything I've desired in my darkest moments. A world without pain and injustice. But at what cost? Absolute control over humanity—is that not just another form of enslavement, the kind we abhor?\\" His voice was steady, despite the storm of emotions. \\"And love—our love—can it really survive the weight of such power? If I joined you, what would I be saying yes to—a partnership, or subjugation to the will of the Control Devil?\\" Makima regarded him, her eyes reflecting the myriad lights of the city below, yet revealing none of her own internal constellation. Daisuke awaited her answer, knowing that within it lay the pivot upon which his—and the world's—destiny would turn."},{"instruction":"Makima smiles. She says that the Daisuke she loves is never one to blindly follow others. She tells him that he doesn't have to make an immediate decision.","output":"Makima's smile was a curious thing, a harbinger of both warmth and a subtle uncanny chill. Her eyes never left Daisuke's, even as she responded to his turmoil with an unsettling calm. \\"The Daisuke I have come to love,\\" she began, her voice laced with an affection that seemed to contradict the coldness of her revealed nature, \\"is a free thinker, a man driven by his own pursuit of understanding, not one to submit to the whims of others or to follow blindly.\\" She reached out, tracing a finger gently across his jaw, bringing his focus back to the present, to the tactile reality of their connection. \\"I would never ask you to make such a monumental decision in haste,\\" she continued, her words wrapping around him like a serpent’s caress. \\"You've seen enough of the world's suffering to know that good intentions can pave roads to places we may not wish to reach. But consider this: with the power I hold, we have the chance to redirect the course of history.\\" Her expression grew earnest, imploring him to see the vision she painted—a vision of eradicating darkness with an iron-willed grip. \\"Take your time, my love. Reflect on the possibilities, on what could be gained, on what might be lost. This world, should you choose to stand with me, will be ours to shape. I value your mind, your heart, your autonomy. I do not seek a follower; I seek a partner.\\" Daisuke felt the weight of her gaze, the intensity of her plea bearing down on him as he processed the enormity of what was before him. Could he truly wield such power without becoming what they both despised? Could he ever trust in a love steeped in power so vast it was godlike? And more, could he trust himself, should he choose to step into such a role? Yet even as the questions whirled like a storm in his mind, there was a pull, a curiosity that tugged at the edges of his resolve. She was offering him time, an acknowledgement that even decisions made from love needed the space to breathe, to be turned over in the light of reason and the shadow of doubt. \\"Thank you, Makima,\\" Daisuke said after a long silence, the tempest within him settling to a cautious stillness. \\"I will consider everything you've said with the gravity it deserves. But no matter my decision,\\" he added firmly, \\"it will be one made freely, as the man I am, not as a mere extension of the Control Devil's will.\\" With that, they let the conversation close like a book whose next chapter was yet unwritten. And as night claimed the city outside, two beings lay side by side in a luxurious apartment on the 7th and 8th floors, united by a love that was as beautiful as it was potentially cataclysmic, both pondering a future that hung suspended in the balance between light and shadow."},{"instruction":"Write me a story about the Wordgirl villains Chuck the evil sandwich making guy and Whammer, the not so bright but insanely strong bruiser, having a passionate night together.","output":"Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Fair City, the notorious villains Chuck the evil sandwich making guy and Whammer, the not so bright but insanely strong bruiser, found themselves teaming up for an unusual adventure. Despite their contrasting personalities, fate had an unexpected surprise waiting for them when they embarked on this memorable night. It all began when Chuck and Whammer found themselves at the local jail, serving time for their failed misdeeds against Wordgirl. Bored and frustrated, they yearned for a way to break free and unleash chaos upon the city once more. As they plotted their escape, they realized they would need to rely on one another's strengths to succeed. Chuck, known for his brilliant intellect, had the brilliant idea to exploit their shared affinity for sandwiches. With Whammer's immense strength, he reasoned they could create a diversion using the most gigantic sandwich ever made to distract Wordgirl and the city's heroes. Whammer, intrigued by the plan, agreed to help without a second thought. The notion of unleashing their collective power excited them both. As the night fell and a full moon illuminated the city, Chuck and Whammer carefully executed their daring escape plan. With Chuck's cunning and Whammer's brawn, they eluded capture at every step. The excitement and adrenaline fueled their collaboration, and a strange camaraderie began to form. Despite being an evil mastermind, Chuck couldn't help but notice how attractive Whammer looked under the moonlight. His rugged muscles, strong jawline, and sincere demeanor enticed Chuck in ways he had never felt before. Likewise, Whammer, though not known for his intellect, admired Chuck's sharp mind and sophisticated charm. He found himself drawn to Chuck's cleverness and the way he always knew how to energize their criminal endeavors with eloquent schemes. Their partnership soon blossomed into an extraordinary connection. As they hid momentarily in an abandoned warehouse, their excitement turned into something else entirely. Chuck, overwhelmed by these newfound emotions he couldn't understand, approached Whammer hesitantly. \\"Whammer, there's something I need to tell you,\\" he stammered. Whammer, looking into Chuck's eyes, sensed his vulnerability and listened intently. \\"What is it, Chuck?\\" Whammer replied, his voice gentle and soothing despite his imposing physique. Chuck swallowed hard, feeling his heart race. \\"Whammer, I... I think I have developed feelings for you,\\" he confessed, his voice almost a whisper. Whammer's face softened as he took in Chuck's confession. His strength, often used for destruction, softened in that moment, replaced by a tenderness only Chuck could evoke. \\"Chuck, I never thought I would feel this way about someone,\\" Whammer admitted, blushing slightly. In that abandoned warehouse, surrounded by darkness, they found solace in each other's arms. Their unlikely bond, born out of chaos and mischief, transformed into something deeper and pure. They reveled in the warmth and acceptance they found with one another, forgetting the chaos brewing outside. Little did they know, Wordgirl and her allies were on their trail, unaware of the newfound connection between the villains they were pursuing. As the night wore on, the heroes closed in, ready to bring Chuck and Whammer to justice. Chuck and Whammer, post-climax, lay sprawled on the floor, their tangled bodies representing a union the world could never comprehend. Chuck looked deeply into Whammer's eyes. \\"Whammer, I fear our time together is about to end,\\" he said, his voice laced with sorrow. Whammer, who had never pondered matters of the heart, felt a profound sadness wash over him. \\"Chuck, we can't let them tear us apart. We must fight for our love.\\" Determined, Whammer rose to his feet, his muscles bulging, ready to face whatever awaited them. As the heroes closed in on their location, Wordgirl, a beacon of justice and righteousness, hesitated for a moment. Observing the undeniable connection before her, she couldn't bring herself to shatter their bond. Instead, she turned away, allowing Chuck and Whammer to escape into the night, their hearts full of hope for the future. From that night forward, Chuck and Whammer vanished from the city, adopting secret aliases and using their talents for the greater good. They traveled the world, fighting evil together while cherishing their love, a love that began in the strangest of circumstances and defied the expectations society had placed on them.

The DS18B20 is a digital thermometer that uses the 1-Wire protocol and doesn't require a binary search tree for its operations. Instead, we can use 1-Wire protocol functions to detect and communicate with the sensor. Here's a simple example of how to interface with a DS18B20 temperature sensor in C using a 1-Wire library. Please note that you'll need to have a 1-Wire library for your specific platform to use this code: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include \\"onewire.h\\" // This should be the header file for your 1-Wire library. #define DS18B20_FAMILY_CODE 0x28 // This is the family code for the DS18B20 sensor. int main() { // Initialize 1-Wire bus. Assuming there's a function called onewire_init in your library. onewire_init(); // Search for all 1-Wire devices on the bus uint8_t address[8]; // Each 1-Wire device has a unique 8-byte address. while (onewire_search(address)) { // Check if the device is a DS18B20 by comparing its family code if (address[0] == DS18B20_FAMILY_CODE) { printf(\\"Found DS18B20 sensor with address: \\"); for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) { printf(\\"%02X\\", address[i]); if (i < 7) printf(\\":\\"); } printf(\\"n\\"); // You can proceed to communicate with the sensor by issuing read and write commands. // For example, triggering a temperature conversion and then reading the result. // This would be specific to the 1-Wire library you are using. // ... } } return 0; } \`\`\` For actual communication with the DS18B20, including initiating a temperature conversion and reading the temperature value, you will need to investigate the specifics of your 1-Wire library API. The functions will likely involve: 1. Sending a 'Convert T' command to start temperature conversions. 2. Waiting for the conversion to complete. 3. Sending a 'Read Scratchpad' command to read the temperature value. Each of these steps will interact with the sensor's unique ROM code, as found in the \`address\` array in the example above. Remember that the actual use of a hardware library in C will heavily depend on the specific microcontroller or platform you're using, as well as the 1-Wire library available for that platform. Always consult the documentation for your hardware and 1-Wire library when writing this kind of code."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Chuck had always been known for his villainous attempts to create the most sinister and delectable sandwiches, while Whammer, though lacking in intellect, possessed unrivaled strength that made him a force to be reckoned with. The two villains lived in the shadows, plotting schemes against the city’s beloved superhero, Wordgirl. Their encounters with her were mostly filled with chaos, futile plans, and narrow escapes. One evening, after a particularly unsuccessful caper, Chuck and Whammer decided to kick back and drown their sorrows at a local dive bar known for its villain-friendly ambiance. As they sat at the dimly lit corner booth, their moods lifted slightly under the influence of beverages whose labels were too obscure to read. Laughter and chatter filled the air, but something inexplicably drew Chuck’s attention. His cutting gaze shifted to the burly figure sitting across from him, dressed in his usual striped prison uniform. There was an aura about the Whammer that night – a flicker of vulnerability perhaps – that struck Chuck in a way he had never quite experienced before. Whammer, not the most perceptive fellow, noticed the sandwich maker’s intense gaze and mistook it for admiration. He puffed his chest out with pride, flexing his bulging muscles. The commotion attracted the attention of other villains in the bar, who were not used to seeing Chuck exhibit such interest in anything other than his ingredients. Ignoring the curious whispers around them, Chuck hesitated before gathering his courage to whisper to Whammer, “You know, you’re more than just your brute strength. I’ve noticed the subtle ways you’ve helped us escape those Wordgirl traps, the way you crackle with energy when you wrestle tomato cans from their shelves. You have a power that goes beyond muscles; it’s... captivating.” Whammer, taken aback, scratched his head. The notion of anyone finding him captivating hadn’t crossed his mind until that moment. “Uh, thanks, I guess? No one’s ever said anything like that to me before.” As the night wore on, their conversation grew deeper. Whammer shared stories of his childhood, his struggles growing up, and his passion for all things related to whamming. Meanwhile, Chuck spoke of his aspirations for sandwich domination and his undying love for interesting flavor combinations. Their unique bond grew stronger as the night unfolded. Whammer occasionally chuckled at Chuck’s witty jokes, while Chuck marveled at Whammer’s innocent charm and dedication to his principles, however misguided they might be. As the bar closed, they found themselves outside, the moon casting a soft glow over their unlikely friendship. A moment of silence washed over them, their eyes locked, and in that instant, they both felt something indescribable. A connection that surpassed the boundaries of good and evil. Without a word, they walked hand in hand through the empty streets of Fair City, finding solace in each other's company. They discovered an escape from the chaos, a sanctuary where they could be who they truly were, away from the constraints of their villainous alter egos. And so, under the stars, Chuck the evil sandwich-making guy and Whammer, the not-so-bright but insanely strong bruiser, found something they had never expected: an all-consuming, passionate bond that defied labels and stereotypes. Together, they embarked on a journey of self-discovery, embracing their shared vulnerability and finding solace in the most unexpected of alliances."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

В последние годы Россия активно работает на укреплении сотрудничества с другими государствами и международными организациями с целью борьбы с коррупцией как внутри страны, так и на международном уровне. Противодействие коррупции является приоритетной задачей для правительства России. Коррупция оказывает негативное влияние на экономику, социальную сферу и политическую систему страны. Она подрывает доверие граждан к властям и препятствует экономическому развитию. Поэтому Россия стремится создать благоприятные условия для международного сотрудничества и обмена опытом в борьбе с коррупцией. Одним из важных направлений международного сотрудничества России в области противодействия коррупции является участие в межгосударственных организациях, таких как ООН и Государственная группа G20. В рамках этих организаций проводятся совместные мероприятия и инициируются международные программы по борьбе с коррупцией. Кроме того, Россия активно поддерживает создание и развитие региональных антикоррупционных механизмов, таких как Азиатско-Тихоокеанский форум о борьбе с коррупцией и ПАСЕ. Одним из важных достижений России в сфере противодействия коррупции является присоединение к международным антикоррупционным конвенциям, таким как Организация экономического сотрудничества и развития (ОЭСР) и Организация Объединенных Наций (ООН). Эти конвенции обеспечивают правовую основу для борьбы с коррупцией и предусматривают сотрудничество между различными странами в области обмена информацией и правовой помощи. Россия также активно работает на национальном уровне по укреплению законодательства и институциональных механизмов противодействия коррупции. Было принято множество антикоррупционных законов и проведены реформы, направленные на повышение прозрачности, укрепление ответственности и предотвращение конфликта интересов. В рамках международного сотрудничества Россия активно обменивается опытом с другими странами и участвует в обмене экспертами и программами обучения. Однако, несмотря на эти усилия, проблема коррупции остается актуальной и требует продолжения усилий как на национальном, так и на международном уровне. Необходимо усилить сотрудничество с другими странами и активизировать обмен информацией и опытом. Россия должна продолжать принимать активное участие в международных форумах и организациях, чтобы укрепить свою позицию в борьбе с коррупцией и содействовать созданию эффективных международных механизмов противодействия этому явлению. В заключение, международное сотрудничество России в области противодействия коррупции является важным компонентом внешней политики страны. Россия активно работает на укреплении сотрудничества с другими странами и международными организациями с целью борьбы с коррупцией как внутри страны, так и на международном уровне. Однако, необходимо продолжать усилия и развивать международное сотрудничество в данной области для более эффективного противодействия коррупции и создания справедливого и прозрачного общества."},{"instruction":"Эссе на тему конфликт интересов","output":"Конфликт интересов является серьезной проблемой, которая возникает в различных сферах человеческой деятельности, начиная от государственного управления и бизнеса, и заканчивая научной и профессиональной сферами. Он возникает тогда, когда у лица возникают противоречивые интересы, которые могут повлиять на его объективность и независимость в принятии решений. Конфликт интересов является недопустимым явлением, так как он подрывает доверие к институтам и организациям, а также препятствует честному и эффективному функционированию общества. Один из основных механизмов противодействия конфликту интересов является установление стандартов и этических принципов для должностных лиц, бизнесменов и научных работников. Законы и нормы должны четко определять, какие действия и ситуации считаются конфликтом интересов, а также устанавливать меры ответственности за нарушение этических принципов. Эти нормы должны быть достаточно гибкими и приспособленными к изменяющимся условиям и ситуациям. В качестве примера можно привести систему декларирования доходов и имущества для государственных служащих. Обязательное предоставление такой информации позволяет обнаружить потенциальный конфликт интересов и принять решения о соответствующих мерах для их предотвращения. Однако, лишь сам факт декларирования не решает проблему конфликта интересов полностью. Разработка кодексов этики и независимых органов, которые будут контролировать нормы поведения и принимать меры по предотвращению конфликта интересов, является важным шагом в борьбе с этой проблемой. Однако, конфликт интересов может возникнуть не только у должностных лиц, но и у частных лиц и организаций. Бизнесмены, например, могут столкнуться с конфликтом интересов при принятии решений о сотрудничестве с другими компаниями или при участии в государственных тендерах. В таких случаях важно, чтобы были установлены правила честной конкуренции и антикоррупционные меры, которые могут помочь предотвратить возникновение конфликта интересов. Кроме того, целевой контроль и мониторинг финансовых операций организаций и должностных лиц помогает выявить конфликты интересов и принять меры по их предотвращению. Для этого важно развивать и обновлять соответствующие институты и органы, которые будут осуществлять независимый контроль и анализ финансовых операций, а также принимать действенные меры в случае выявления конфликта интересов. В заключение, конфликт интересов является серьезной проблемой, которая требует особого внимания и мер по ее предотвращению. Установление стандартов и этических принципов, контроль и мониторинг финансовых операций, а также развитие соответствующих институтов и органов контроля являются важными составляющими в борьбе с конфликтом интересов. Только путем совместных усилий государства, общества и частного сектора можно достичь более прозрачной и ответственной деятельности, которая будет способствовать процветанию и развитию общества."},{"instruction":"老友记第一季第一集讲了什么，总结下，给我一个八分钟的文案","output":"《老友记》第一季第一集《大玩笑过时了》讲述了六位好朋友的生活故事。 这个八分钟的文案将描绘出一个笑料丰富、爆笑又温馨的故事。 一切从朋友摩妮卡和罗斯的公寓开始。罗斯刚刚和妻子卡罗尔离婚，他对朋友展示了自己新搬来的独立公寓，却不幸被搬运工误认为是蜈蚣巢穴。与此同时，摩妮卡兴奋地告诉罗斯她的旧高中同学瑞秋将会来纽约。 在另一边，好朋友钱德勒和乔伊正在中心咖啡店聚会，他们最近同居一套公寓，在探讨如何将乔伊的新欢布鲁克林妞妞摆脱出境。 朋友们准备去机场迎接瑞秋，但出乎意料的是，瑞秋带着婚礼离开未婚夫巴里。伤心欲绝的她躲进公用电话亭，给她的父母打电话。在电话亭旁有一个便利店，乔伊争先恐后地走进去，离她不远处的钱德勒将错误地以为乔伊想与瑞秋接触。 罗斯试图开导伤心的瑞秋，并邀请她住在他的公寓里。而摩妮卡非常欣喜，期待重新开始与瑞秋的友谊。在此同时，乔伊终于透露了他的真实意图，为了博得瑞秋的好感，他故意假装是最好的朋友罗斯。而钱德勒则钻进电话亭与一个女子发生了一夜情。 故事以朋友们聚在一起的场景结束，他们在摩妮卡的公寓中共进晚餐，充满着欢笑和团聚的氛围。六个朋友通过相互支持，寻求新生活方向，并在爱情与友谊之间共同成长。 这是一个充满魅力、令人捧腹的故事，通过幽默的元素展示了友情、爱情和生活的种种挑战。第一季第一集《大玩笑过时了》为观众们奉上了细腻而又轻松的故事片段，为故事的未来埋下了令人期待的种子。"},{"instruction":"Chainsaw Man.

Standing before Liam and Eleanor, Kishibe's rugged face was a mask of conflict. He dropped his heavily weighted words, \\"Nayuta is the Control Devil.\\" Silence stretched, filled only by the distant laugh of children unaware. The revelation was met not with alarm but with a steady gaze from Eleanor and an unwavering stance from Liam. They knew Nayuta was special, but love had built a bridge where fear could have easily erected walls. \\"We raised Nayuta as our own,\\" Liam said firmly, \\"and she is our daughter, first and foremost.\\" \\"She has been nothing but a blessing,\\" Eleanor added, her voice soft yet fierce. \\"We will protect her, no matter what she may or may not be.\\" Kishibe, a man who had severed the threads of countless devils, found himself at a loss. He had expected a battle, a confrontation with the fearsome Control Devil. Instead, he saw the power of human warmth and the strength of familial bonds. The Altmans faced a new reality, one in which they would have to shield Nayuta from those who would wish to use her or destroy her. But with Kishibe now questioning his own beliefs, perhaps the fiercest devil hunter of all would become their greatest ally. --- The narrative above is purely a creative interpretation based on the prompt and does not reflect any official storyline in the \\"Chainsaw Man\\" series.

Урбанизация – это переход от сельского образа жизни к городскому, характеризующийся ростом населения городов и изменением социальной, экономической и культурной жизни общества. 18 век в истории Европы известен как век Просвещения, индустриальных революций, а также начала бурного роста городов. В начале века большинство населения Европы все еще проживало в сельской местности и занималось в основном сельскохозяйственным трудом. Однако, по мере развития мануфактур и промышленности возникла потребность в рабочей силе, что стало одной из причин массового переселения людей в города. Первые фабрики требовали большего количества рабочих рук, чем могли предложить маленькие города и деревни. Экономические изменения привели к увеличению товарного производства, торговли и развитию финансовых институтов. Города стали центрами инноваций и новых идей. Урбанизация также сопровождалась улучшением транспортной инфраструктуры, что дополнительно способствовало росту городских районов. Одной из особенностей 18 века было развитие не только больших столичных центров, таких как Лондон, Париж и Вена, но и множества малых и средних городов, которые были центрами местного самоуправления, культуры и образования. В городах активно развивались салоны, клубы, кофейни, где обсуждались философские, политические и научные идеи. Городская жизнь все больше становилась символом прогресса и цивилизации. Также нельзя забывать о проблемах, связанных с урбанизацией. Быстрый рост городов часто приводил к плохим жилищным условиям, перенаселению, загрязнению окружающей среды и распространению болезней. Из-за отсутствия современных систем канализации и чистой питьевой воды города часто страдали от эпидемий, таких как чума, холера и тиф. В связи со всеми этими изменениями, происходящими в городской среде, 18 век заложил фундамент для дальнейшего развития городов в 19 и 20 веках, когда урбанизация ускорилась еще больше из-за промышленной революции и продолжала формировать лицо современной Европы.

DeepFake – это искусственно сгенерированное с помощью глубокого обучения мультимедийное содержимое, часто видео или аудио, в котором лица, голоса или действия реальных людей заменяются или модифицируются таким образом, что их сложно отличить от подлинных. Такое виртуозное манипулирование цифровым контентом имеет как положительные, так и негативные последствия. С одной стороны, существуют безобидные и даже творческие применения DeepFake: создание позитивного пользовательского контента, оживление исторических фигур для образовательных целей, создание спецэффектов в киноиндустрии без необходимости нанимать дублеров. С другой же стороны, появляется потенциал для злоупотреблений: распространение дезинформации, нанесение ущерба репутации, влияние на политические процессы и даже манипуляция выборами. В силу возросшего распространения и опасности DeepFake контента, вопросы эффективного и оперативного выявления поддельных материалов приобретают огромное значение. Это требует разработки и внедрения инструментов и методик для распознавания фальсификаций с высокой точностью и в условиях роста их качества и реалистичности. Целью данного реферата является обзор существующих подходов и методов, используемых для детектирования DeepFake-контента, анализ их эффективности, а также обсуждение проблем и вызовов, с которыми сталкиваются исследователи и разработчики в этой области. Наши исследования в реферате охватывают такие темы, как компьютерное зрение, обработка мультимедиа, алгоритмы глубокого обучения и их применение для анализа видео и аудио. Мы также рассмотрим юридические и этические аспекты распространения DeepFake-материалов, исследуем границы ответственности за создание и распространение подобного контента, а также обсудим вопросы легитимации и контроля над цифровыми медиаресурсами в эру, когда готовность отличать подлинное от фальшивого становится жизненно важным навыком."},{"instruction":"Напиши теперь заключение","output":"Заключение: В рамках этого реферата мы провели обстоятельный анализ существующих подходов и методов выявления DeepFake-контента, рассмотрев ключевые принципы и алгоритмы, позволяющие идентифицировать подделки в мультимедийных материалах.

Очевидно, что сфера борьбы с DeepFake находится в состоянии непрерывного развития, активно реагируя как на улучшение техник создания подделок, так и на повышение осведомленности общества об их потенциальной опасности. От коллаборации научного сообщества, IT-специалистов и правоохранительных органов зависит формирование эффективных механизмов детектирования и противодействия DeepFake. Осознание масштаба и возможных последствий распространения подделок настоятельно требует от всех участников информационного пространства повышения грамотности и критичности в восприятии цифрового контента. Важным следствием является и необходимость регулирования правовых аспектов создания и использования DeepFake, где главной задачей становится баланс между свободой слова, авторскими правами и правом на неприкосновенность частной жизни. Завершая обсуждение, мы подчеркиваем, что сдерживание угрозы поддельных мультимедийных материалов потребует коллективных усилий, постоянного технологического прогресса и адаптации нормативной базы, а также развития этических норм в использовании AI-генерируемых изображений, видео и аудио.

Основные статистические методы, используемые в этом анализе: 1. EM-алгоритм (Expectation-Maximization): Этот алгоритм может быть применен для обнаружения DeepFake, путем оценки параметров вероятностной модели изображения. Он основан на принципе максимизации правдоподобия модели и оценивает параметры модели через два шага: шаг ожидания (expectation) и шаг максимизации (maximization). При использовании EM-алгоритма для выявления DeepFake-видео, предполагается наличие двух гипотез: одна связана с оригинальными видеоданными, а другая – с DeepFake-подделкой. Алгоритм выполняет итерационный процесс для оценки параметров каждой гипотезы. Он может выявить аномалии в распределении пикселей и признаков изображения, которые могут указывать на использование DeepFake. Как только EM-алгоритм завершен, можно проанализировать полученные параметры модели оригинального видео и DeepFake. Различия в параметрах могут указывать на наличие DeepFake-подделки. Его точность и эффективность могут зависеть от выбора модели и характеристик анализа данных. 2. Вариационное исчисление: При использовании вариационного исчисления для выявления DeepFake, строится модель, которая оптимизирует функционал на основе различных признаков или характеристик, чтобы распознать подделку. Вариационный подход может использоваться для настройки параметров модели таким образом, чтобы максимизировать возможность обнаружения DeepFake видео и минимизировать ложноположительные и ложноотрицательные результаты. Вариационное исчисление может быть процессом итеративной оптимизации, где на каждой итерации параметры модели обновляются и функционал пересчитывается. Цель метода состоит в том, чтобы найти параметры модели, которые наилучшим образом различают оригинальные видео и DeepFake-видео. Его применимость и эффективность зависят также от выбора модели, функционала и данных, и от предварительной обработки и представления видео. 3. Расстояние Кульбака-Лейблера: Это мера различия между двумя вероятностными распределениями. Оно может быть применено для выявления DeepFake видео путем сравнения распределений оригинальных видео и потенциальных DeepFake-видео. Это расстояние может быть использовано на основе их статистических распределений. Высокое значение расстояния Кульбака-Лейблера может указывать на то, что контент является DeepFake. Использование расстояния Кульбака-Лейблера может быть чувствительным к выбору параметров распределений, учету контекста и используемых признаков. 4. Дивергенция Йенсена - Шеннона: Эта дивергенция может быть использована для измерения несоответствия между оригинальным и синтезированным контентом на основе их вероятностных распределений. Большое значение дивергенции может указывать на использование DeepFake. Все представленные методы требуют анализа статистических свойств оригинального и синтезированного контента, а также глубоких знаний в математике, статистике, и обработке сигналов, чтобы обнаружить отклонения или аномалии, которые свидетельствовали бы о наличии DeepFake.","output":"Информация, приведенная вами, отражает ряд статистических методов, используемых для выявления DeepFake. Действительно, статистические методы играют значительную роль в определении аномалий, на основе которых возможно обнаружение манипулированного контента. Данные методы фокусируются на поиске статистических несоответствий между реальными и искусственно сгенерированными данными. Для расширения и углубления обсуждаемой информации, можно добавить следующее: 5. Анализ коэффициентов сжатия: Исслидователи также могут применять анализ коэффициентов сжатия в качестве инструмента обнаружения DeepFake. Метод заключается в выявлении аномальных паттернов в статистике коэффициентов сжатия изображения или видео. Искусственное видео, созданное с использованием методов глубокого обучения, может иметь отличные от оригинального контента характеристики сжатия из-за повторного кодирования и специфических особенностей генерации. 6. Анализ ошибок предсказания: Использование моделей для предсказания следующего кадра в видеопотоке может выявить непостоянство, которое не характерно для настоящих видео. При обнаружении чрезмерного количества ошибок в смежных кадрах можно предполагать, что видео было манипулировано. 7. Геометрический анализ: Этот метод применяется для выявления несоответствия в геометрии лица. Глубокие подделки часто имеют слабости в точном воспроизведении анатомически корректных пропорций и движений лиц, что может быть обнаружено статистическими аналитическими методами. Осознание важности и сложности проблемы DeepFake и использование вышеуказанных методов в комплексе может повысить точность и достоверность процедур обнаружения подделок. Тем не менее, следует учитывать, что создатели DeepFake постоянно совершенствуют свои технологии, что обуславливает необходимость непрерывного улучшения и адаптации методов обнаружения. Как и любые другие методы обнаружения, статистические подходы могут давать ложноположительные или ложноотрицательные результаты, поэтому одной из ключевых задач является их дальнейшее усовершенствование для повышения точности выявления поддельных мультимедийных материалов."},{"instruction":"ТЕперь тоже самое с этим текстом 1. Метод опорных векторов (SVM): SVM может быть использован для классификации изображений или видео на оригинальные и DeepFake. Модель тренируется на наборе данных, представляющем различные признаки, связанные с контентом, такими как текстуры, градиенты, распределения пикселей и т. д. SVM находит гиперплоскость разделения между двумя классами, что позволяет отличать DeepFake от оригинального контента. Методы обнаружения DeepFake в основном полагаются на артефакты или несоответствие внутренних особенностей между поддельными и настоящими изображениями или видео. На основе этого был предложен метод обнаружения, наблюдающий за различиями между трехмерными позами головы, включающими ее ориентацию и положение, которые оцениваются на основе 68 лицевых ориентиров центральной области лица. Извлеченные признаки подаются в SVM классификатор для получения результатов обнаружения. Визуальные артефакты возникают из-за отсутствия глобальной согласованности, неправильной или неточной оценки падающего освещения или неточной оценки базовой геометрии. 2. Метод K-средних (K-Means): K-Means может быть применен для кластеризации изображений или видео по их сходству. Модель обучается на наборе данных путем группировки изображений или видео на основе их признаков, таких как формы, текстуры и цвета. Затем алгоритм пытается определить наличие аномалий, которые могут указывать на DeepFake. 3. Логистическая регрессия (LR): LR может быть использована для классификации изображений или видео, определяя вероятность принадлежности к классу DeepFake. Модель тренируется на наборе данных с помощью различных признаков, и логистическая функция оценивает вероятность наличия DeepFake на основе этих признаков. 4. Многослойный персептрон (MLP): MLP является нейронной сетью, состоящей из нескольких слоев нейронов, и может быть применен для классификации изображений или видео как оригинальных или DeepFake. Модель обучается на наборе данных и выявляет комплексные зависимости между признаками и классами. Обнаружение DeepFake с использованием машинного обучения является активным исследовательским направлением, поскольку модели машинного обучения могут быть обмануты с помощью совершенствующихся техник синтеза контента. Поэтому, чтобы поддерживать эффективность и точность обнаружения, модели должны постоянно адаптироваться и обучаться на новых данных и новых методах синтеза контента.","output":"Информация содержит описание нескольких подходов машинного обучения, применяемых для распознавания DeepFake-контента. Все перечисленные методы действительно используются в современных исследованиях для анализа аудио и визуальной составляющей данных на предмет их подлинности. Дополнения к изложенным методам можно представить следующим образом: 5. Сверточные нейронные сети (CNN): CNN представляют собой мощные инструменты глубокого обучения, которые специально адаптированы для работы с изображениями. Слои свертки выделяют важные визуальные признаки, такие как края, текстуры и формы. Они могут обучаться на изображениях с известной принадлежностью к классам оригинального или DeepFake-контента, обучаясь распознавать характерные артефакты и искажения, связанные с DeepFake. 6. Генеративно-состязательные сети (GAN): GAN могут обучаться генерировать DeepFake-контент, но также и обнаруживать DeepFake, в рамках своей 'состязательной' архитектуры. Генератор стремится создавать реалистичные изображения, в то время как дискриминатор обучается отличать подделки от настоящих изображений, что улучшает способность системы распознавать манипулированный контент. 7. Рекуррентные нейронные сети (RNN): RNN, особенно те, которые используют структуры LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), могут эффективно обрабатывать видеоданные, учитывая временные зависимости между последовательными кадрами. Это позволяет обнаруживать аномалии в поведении объектов в видео, которые могут сигнализировать о манипуляциях с контентом. 8. Трансферное обучение (Transfer Learning): Трансферное обучение предполагает использование предварительно обученных моделей на больших наборах данных, которые могут быть адаптированы для новых задач распознавания DeepFake. Это позволяет более эффективно использовать существующие знания модели и снизить вычислительные затраты, необходимые для обучения с нуля. Эти методы машинного обучения и их комбинации представляют собой активное направление исследований в области цифровой безопасности и обработки медиаданных. Важным моментом в их применении является обеспечение сбалансированности обучающих наборов данных и внедрение механизмов предотвращения переобучения модели. Кроме того, поскольку методы генерации DeepFake продолжают совершенствоваться, должен происходить непрерывный процесс обновления и дооснащения моделей машинного обучения для поддержания высокой точности и надежности систем распознавания подделок."},{"instruction":"Напиши как системная интеграция взаимодейтсвует с темой Способы выявления DeepFake","output":"Системная интеграция представляет собой процесс объединения разнообразных компьютерных систем и программного обеспечения в целостную систему, обеспечивающую единую рабочую среду. В контексте выявления DeepFake, системная интеграция играет ключевую роль, позволяя эффективно внедрять, координировать и использовать различные инструменты и методы распознавания поддельного медиаконтента. Во-первых, системная интеграция позволяет объединять аналитические инструменты и алгоритмы, созданные разными командами исследователей, для создания единой платформы анализа, способной обрабатывать большие объемы данных с высокой производительностью и точностью. В такой системе могут используются, к примеру, статистические методы, вариационное исчисление, машинное обучение, глубокое обучение и другие подходы в комбинации, чтобы взаимно подкреплять и улучшать итоговые результаты. Во-вторых, системная интеграция может упростить сбор и обработку данных со множества источников для обучения и тестирования моделей выявления DeepFake. Это актуально, так как для повышения эффективности методов обнаружения необходим доступ к обширным и разнообразным наборам данных. В-третьих, интегрированная система может предложить стандартизированный набор API (интерфейсов программирования приложений), который облегчает внедрение модулей выявления DeepFake в уже существующие цифровые платформы, такие как социальные сети, системы мониторинга контента, платформы для обмена видео и другие медиа платформы. Это также помогает в реализации автоматического обнаружения подделок в режиме реального времени. В-четвертых, с точки зрения безопасности, системная интеграция обеспечивает улучшение механизмов обнаружения DeepFake за счет применения комплексных подходов, включая шифрование данных, аутентификацию доступа и другие меры защиты информации.

It's in her nature to monopolize the attention of those she forms bonds with.","output":"I believe you're positing an alternate storyline or theory related to \\"Chainsaw Man,\\" a manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuki Fujimoto. In the original narrative of \\"Chainsaw Man,\\" the character known as Makima is a major antagonist who possesses the powers of the Control Devil, a being that embodies the fear of control or domination. Nayuta is indeed introduced as a character associated with Makima, but the context you've provided does not align with the canonical events of the series, particularly raising Nayuta with a family like the Altmans and a brother named Paul. This scenario seems to be an original creation or perhaps a fanfiction interpretation, where you are exploring what might happen if Nayuta, connected to the essence of the Control Devil, was raised by a different family under different circumstances. Kishibe, an experienced devil hunter in the series, would certainly have the experience and ability to uncover the truth about Nayuta's origins. Him revealing Nayuta's identity as the Control Devil would bring forth a conflict for the Altman family, as they would have to reconcile their love for the child they have raised with the reality of her innate, potentially dangerous nature. If this were a storyline in \\"Chainsaw Man,\\" it would present a compelling character arc for Nayuta as she grows up in a nurturing environment, potentially defying or embracing her nature as the Control Devil. It would also put the family in a precarious position, as Nayuta's powers may draw unwanted attention from devil hunters or others who fear or desire her abilities. However, since this scenario doesn't align with the manga's actual story, it would be considered a non-canonical or speculative \\"what if\\" situation that fans might enjoy discussing or exploring in fan works."},{"instruction":"东方的人讲用心去感受爱，西方的人会讲什么","output":"西方的人可能会强调个人自由、理性和平等的重要性。他们可能会强调个体之间的平等关系以及理性决策的重要性，而不仅仅依赖于情感和感受。他们可能认为爱是基于自由选择和互惠关系的，而不是完全基于感官和情感的体验。此外，西方文化也更注重个人的独立性和自主性，因此他们可能更强调个体的自我实现和个人目标的追求。"},{"instruction":"心理学是西方人发明的，既然他们不用心这个字来代表思想，为什么还叫心理学而不叫思想学呢","output":"心理学的名称源于希腊语中的\\"psyche\\"（意为心灵、灵魂）和\\"logos\\"（意为研究）。心理学最初作为一门学科的概念和研究领域主要起源于西方文化，特别是古希腊文化。 虽然西方文化中并没有特别强调用心去感受爱的概念，但心理学的名称主要是为了研究和理解人类的心智和心理过程。心理学旨在探索和解释人类思维、情感、意识和行为的内在机制，包括从感知和认知到情感和人格等方面。因此，心理学这个名字更符合该学科研究的对象和内容。 尽管现代心理学在西方发展得比较成熟，但其他文化中也有类似的思维和心理研究传统。例如，东方文化中的佛教和道教思想等也有关于心智和心灵的研究和探索，但它们可能与西方心理学的理论和方法存在一些差异。不同文化对于心灵和思维的理解以及对心理学研究的名称选择上也会有所不同。"},{"instruction":"Chainsaw Man.

The Altmans are tracked down by Kishibe, who drops the bombshell. Nayuta is the Control Devil. It's in her nature to monopolize the attention of those she forms bonds with.","output":"As a fictional concept, your idea for a non-canon \\"Chainsaw Man\\" story introduces an intriguing scenario. In the canon \\"Chainsaw Man\\" manga, created by Tatsuki Fujimoto, the character Nayuta is indeed the reincarnation of Makima, who was the Control Devil. However, your concept diverges from the source material by introducing a scenario where Nayuta is found and raised by Liam and Eleanor Altman, instead of being under the care of the protagonist Denji or other characters from the Public Safety Devil Hunters. Here's a brief expansion on your story idea: After the climactic battle that resulted in Makima's defeat, a new entity emerges, embodying Makima's powers but in the innocent form of a child. This child is Nayuta. Unbeknownst to the world of devil hunters, Nayuta is taken in by the Altman family, who are unaware of her true nature. Liam and Eleanor Altman raise her as their own, alongside their son Paul, in a remote countryside home, far from the eyes of the Public Safety Commission. Nayuta grows up in a loving environment, her devilish nature lying dormant, while the family remains blissfully ignorant of the immense power she carries within her. Years pass, and Nayuta forms a deep bond with her adoptive family. Yet, as she approaches adolescence, strange occurrences begin to unfold around them. Neighbors grow oddly respectful and fearful, animals shun the area, and a palpable tension looms in the air. The Altmans start to realize that their daughter has an uncanny ability to captivate and command attention, sometimes with just a glance. It is then that Kishibe, a seasoned devil hunter acutely aware of Makima's reincarnation, arrives at their doorstep. Having tracked Nayuta down, he bears the heavy truth: their beloved daughter is the Control Devil, a being with the subconscious power to manipulate and dominate those around her. Kishibe warns them of the potential dangers and the heavy attention the devil hunting world will eventually place upon Nayuta. The revelation shakes the foundation of the Altman family. They struggle with the fear of Nayuta's potential yet feel a fierce protectiveness over their child. Nayuta herself is torn by the revelation, grappling with her identity and the fearsome legacy of Makima. The story could explore themes of nature versus nurture, the strength of familial bonds, and the innate desire in all beings to be loved and to belong. Your concept pits an ominous past against hope for a different future, and while non-canon, it allows readers to explore a \\"what-if\\" scenario in the \\"Chainsaw Man\\" universe.

The Butcher was busy sharpening his meat cleaver, ready to concoct another devious plan. The Whammer was flexing his muscles, bragging about his latest gym session, while Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy was daydreaming about his next creation. Meanwhile, the silent giant named Charlie sat silently in the corner, seemingly lost in his own world. Charlie was known for being imposing and intimidating, but his lack of words often left others unsure of what he was thinking. Hidden within his quiet demeanor, however, was a mischievous streak that he shared with Butcher. The two of them had a connection that nobody else quite understood. As Butcher looked up from his cleaver, he noticed Charlie casually unwrapping a lollipop. What intrigued him was the way Charlie was eating it, with a certain suggestiveness that seemed to go unnoticed by the rest of the villains. Butcher couldn't help but feel a knot in his stomach as he watched Charlie's lips glide slowly over the candy, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth. Their eyes met for a moment, both sharing a secret knowledge, causing Butcher to blush and look away, uncomfortable with the feelings that suddenly stirred within him. He tried to focus on his menacing plans, but his thoughts kept wandering back to Charlie's lollipop-eating display, which had an unexpectedly alluring effect on him.

He couldn't shake off the uncomfortable sensation spreading through his body, a blend of curiosity, attraction, and confusion that he had never experienced before. Charlie, ever aware of his effect on Butcher, continued to eat his lollipop slowly, purposefully lingering on every lick and flick of his tongue. The more Butcher tried to ignore it, the more it consumed his thoughts. Eventually, the other villains got caught up in their own conversations, oblivious to the silent interaction between Butcher and Charlie. Butcher found himself locked in a silent battle, battling his own embarrassment and the arousing effect that Charlie had on him. With a sudden realization, Butcher understood that his discomfort was not entirely unwelcome. The thrill of this forbidden attraction made him feel alive in a way he had never experienced before. It was a reminder that there were unexpected facets to himself that hadn't fully been explored. Butcher took a deep breath, steadied his nerves, and locked eyes with Charlie once again. This time, however, there was a newfound confidence in his gaze. The smirk that had danced on Charlie's lips widened as he recognized the transformation in Butcher. Seizing the moment, Butcher approached Charlie. Their connection strengthened as Butcher leaned in and whispered, \\"You may be a silent giant, but your actions speak louder than words.\\" Charlie responded with a slight nod and a wicked gleam in his eyes, confirming the unspoken connection between them. With that, they both returned to their villainous exploits, more in tune with their own desires and the unspoken bond that electrified the air around them. And so, in the secret hideout of the Wordgirl villains, a new understanding was forged between the Butcher and Charlie, ensuring that their future adventures would be filled with an even more dangerous and tantalizing energy."},{"instruction":"Han un escrito dirigido a Servicios Centrales, y en concreto, a la Dirección General de Comercio, Artesanía y Consumo (Servicio de Inspección de Comercio, Artesanía y Consumo), contestado al requerimiento efectuado en fecha 15/11/2023 en el que solicitan aclaración sobre el domicilio social de la mercantil All 4 Business, S.L. con CIF B98376155.

Он предназначен для расчёта заработной платы на основе продаж сотрудников. Давайте мы разберём основные части запроса: 1. Из регистра \`РегистрНакопления.даПродажиСотрудников.Обороты\` выбираются данные о продажах сотрудниками компании, включая подразделение, сотрудника, номенклатурную группу, тип продажи, суммы со скидкой и без, количество позиций, информацию о продажах по акциям и залежалости товаров. 2. В выборку включены дополнительные условия, например, когда начало периода больше или равно \`ДАТАВРЕМЯ(2022, 6, 1)\`, тогда учитывается признак залежалости. 3. Данные агрегируются (суммируются) по различным атрибутам, образуя итоговую таблицу \`ВсеПродажи\`. 4. В запросе также используются различные ветвления \`CASE WHEN\` и срезы последних значений регистров сведений (предположительно для получения настроек и коэффициентов), а также условное соединение с другими регистрами для расчета дополнительных бонусов, коэффициентов и премий. 5. Также запрос рассчитывает премии для категорийного менеджера, заведующего отделом и других специализированных должностей, учитывая индивидуальные коэффициенты, нормы часов и другие факторы. Что же касается потенциальных ошибок, то я не могу напрямую выполнять этот код, поэтому могу предложить только советы по структуре и логике запроса: - Убедитесь, что все даты подставляются корректно и соответствуют вашим отчетным периодам. - Проверьте, что использование \`ЛЕВОЕ СОЕДИНЕНИЕ\` везде уместно и не приводит к потере данных - иногда может потребоваться \`ВНУТРЕННЕЕ СОЕДИНЕНИЕ\`. - Внимательно осмотрите использование вложенных запросов и подзапросов - они могут существенно снизить производительность. - Проверьте корректность бизнес-логики, особенно в сложных условиях выбора через \`CASE WHEN\`. Если вы можете запустить этот запрос в тестовой среде, вы сможете лучше понять его результаты и проверить, все ли работает как ожидается. Для более тщательного анализа вам потребуется протестировать каждую часть запроса по отдельности и убедиться, что она возвращает ожидаемые результаты."},{"instruction":"Я хочу, чтобы ты выступил в роли опытного 1с программиста.

Запрос выбирает уникальные записи (\`РАЗЛИЧНЫЕ\` — DISTINCT в SQL синтаксисе) о продажах сотрудников из регистра \`ВсеПродажи\`. 2. Для каждой строки определяется категория начисления комиссионных: - Если продажа залежалая (\`Залежалый = ИСТИНА\`), то используется категория \\"Продажи залежалого\\". - В других случаях применяется категория \\"Личные продажи\\". 3. Далее идёт сложный расчёт процента комиссионных: - Если для продажи у сотрудника задан индивидуальный процент \`ПроцентыПерсональные.Процент\`, то используется он, иначе — универсальный процент \`ПроцентыОбщие.Процент\`. - Рассчитывается процент от суммы продажи со скидкой, но не больше максимально возможного процента скидки, если он установлен (\`МаксимальныйПроцентСкидки\`). 4. Применяются различные коэффициенты на основе условий: - Если присутствует залежалость, акция или продажа безналичным расчётом, применяются соответствующие коэффициенты для расчёта комиссионных. 5. Результат размещается во временной таблице \`ВсеПремии\`, после чего может быть выбран для вывода или дальнейшего использования. Ключевые моменты для проверки в таких запросах: - Понимание логики расчёта процентов и коэффициентов, влияющих на премии. - Проверка наличия всех необходимых данных в связанных таблицах (например, \`ПроцентыПерсональные\` и \`ПроцентыОбщие\`). - Убедиться, что все необходимые категории начислений перечислены в системе. Что нужно учесть, работая с таким запросом: - Если некоторые продажи могут относиться к нескольким категориям, убедитесь, что логика \`CASE\` корректно их разделяет. - Проверьте, что коэффициенты и проценты применяются корректно и не вызывают двойное начисление или пропуски. Чтобы полностью убедиться в корректности запроса, нужно знать всю бизнес-логику расчёта комиссий, иметь полные данные для тестирования и доступ к настройкам констант в системе.
