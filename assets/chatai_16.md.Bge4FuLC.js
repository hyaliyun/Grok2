Former Governor Bob McDonnell had designated April as Confederate History Month back in 2010, which drew criticism for omitting any mention of slavery. But now, former Governor Terry McAuliffe has issued a proclamation for Confederate History Month that acknowledges and denounces the role of slavery in fueling the Civil War. McAuliffe's proclamation reads, \\"The Confederacy's legacy has been felt in this country for generations, not only in the remnants of its ideology of white supremacy and segregation, but also in the persistent economic disparities between Black and white Americans, in the injustices committed against people of color, and in the efforts of modern-day defenders of Confederate symbols and monuments to hold onto the myth of an honorable Lost Cause.\\" In contrast, McDonnell's proclamation from over a decade ago referred only to \\"the sacrifices of Confederate leaders, soldiers and citizens\\" without acknowledging the central role of slavery in causing the war. This led to widespread criticism and condemnation, with many pointing out that it is impossible to understand the Civil War without recognizing the role of slavery. Even current Governor Ralph Northam has said that \\"you can't whitewash and ignore parts of our history that are painful,\\" although he has not made any specific proclamations about Confederate History Month during his time in office. The debate over Confederate symbols and monuments has continued to rage across the country in recent years, with many arguing that they are symbols of white supremacy and oppression. Some cities and states have chosen to remove or relocate Confederate monuments, while others have chosen to keep them as a reminder of their history. Overall, the issue of Confederate History Month and the legacy of the Confederacy remains a controversial and divisive topic in Virginia and beyond."},{"instruction":"Some international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, such as the Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels.

Taking a cold shower can also help sober up quickly. The cold water can help wake you up and increase your alertness, making you feel less drunk. If you're in a hurry to sober up, you can try taking a \\"Sober Up\\" pill. These pills are designed to help break down alcohol in the body, making you feel more sober.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s.

The Schrödinger equation describes the space and timedependence of a slowly changing (nonrelativistic) wave function of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level) which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by Planck's relation: (where is Planck's constant and the frequency).

In 1949, the CCP launched a campaign to eliminate the KMT forces in northern Burma. The PLA, which had established a presence in the area, worked closely with the Burmese army to rout the KMT units.

Water polo is a sport that involves two teams, each with a goalkeeper, playing against each other in a rectangular pool with two goals on opposite ends. To start the game, both teams race to the ball in the center of the pool, and the game begins as soon as the ball is in the water. Players can hold, pass, and shoot the ball, but only with one hand at a time. It's similar to basketball in that a 30-second shot clock is set, encouraging players to score quickly. Players can wrestle for the ball to win possession without fouling. However, it's important to note that they're not allowed to go closer than 2 meters (6.6 ft) from the goal unless they have the ball. Missed shots are restarted with a throw from the goal or a corner throw, depending on who touched it last. Scoring a goal means passing the entire ball over the entire goal line. After a goal is scored, both teams must be in their own half of the pool before the game can restart. The game involves four separate 8-minute quarters, and teams switch sides after the first two. Water polo is a great way to exercise and have fun at the same time. It's a perfect game to play with friends and family, and can provide a refreshing way to cool down on a hot day.

The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate.

Other theories are based on a pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen.

The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass. Stated differently, the RDA for copper in normal healthy adults is quoted as 0.97 mg/day and as 3.0 mg/day.

The record for the longest touchdown pass in NFL history was set on November 15, 1951, by Norm Van Brocklin of the Los Angeles Rams. In a game against the New York Yanks, Van Brocklin launched a 73-yard touchdown pass to his teammate Jim Benton. This impressive feat has only been matched but never surpassed by any other player in the NFL since then. Van Brocklin’s incredible throw was a product of his natural ability, technique, and strategy. His powerful arm and precision enabled him to successfully execute such an incredible play. The fact that the record still stands over half a century later is a testament to how difficult it is to achieve such a feat. One reason why Van Brocklin's record remains unbroken is that modern football teams have different offensive strategies, with shorter, quicker passes being more common. Additionally, stronger defensive teams are using tactics such as blitzes and coverages that make it harder for quarterbacks to throw deep, limiting their opportunities for long touchdown passes. There have been many impressive long touchdown passes in NFL history, but Van Brocklin's 73-yard throw to Jim Benton remains the longest in NFL history. It is a record that has stood the test of time as only a few players have come extremely close to breaking it, but no one has yet surpassed it. Football fans will likely still be talking about Van Brocklin’s incredible record for many years to come."},{"instruction":"Carolina had a rough start in the first half, only scoring seven points, and went into halftime seventeen points behind Oakland.

Former United captain would never ask for a drink during our meetings. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane's upcoming autobiography, The Second Half, has already generated controversy ahead of its release on Wednesday. Keane apparently shows no remorse towards former teammate Alf-Inge Haaland, whom he infamously tackled in 2001, and also takes aim at his former boss Sir Alex Ferguson. This lack of contrition is not entirely surprising, as Keane has long been known for his no-nonsense attitude and uncompromising personality. As a ghostwriter for a feature on the player in 2001, I saw firsthand how he approached interviews with a certain level of guardedness and reluctance to open up about his personal life. However, Keane has also shown glimpses of generosity and loyalty towards those he respects. He famously gave his Champions League winner's medal from 1999 to a coach who had only positive things to say about him. Keane's communication style is also intriguing - he apparently would only contact others via fax, or would frequently change his phone number to avoid unwanted attention. And despite being known to enjoy a drink or two, Keane would never ask for one during professional meetings. As fans eagerly await the release of The Second Half, it remains to be seen what other insights Keane will share about his eventful career on and off the pitch."},{"instruction":"the following sentence linguistically acceptable?

It can affect your car's fuel efficiency, handling, and even the durability of your tires. That's why it's important to regularly check your tire pressure and adjust it as necessary. To start, attach your pump to the tire valve. You'll need to remove the valve cap first, which is often a small plastic cap that screws onto the valve stem. Once you have the pump secured to the valve, start pumping up your tire. Check the recommended tire pressure for your car, which can usually be found in the owner's manual, on a sticker inside the door jamb, or even on the tire itself. Use a tire pressure gauge to check the pressure as you pump, and adjust as necessary. It's important not to overinflate your tires, as this can be just as dangerous as underinflating them. Once you've inflated the first tire to the correct pressure, replace the valve cap and move on to the next tire. Repeat the process until all of your tires are properly inflated.

More specifically, some fans of the show chose to boycott the movie entirely. This was primarily because the three lead actors in the movie were all Caucasian, whereas in the original TV show, the characters were depicted as being of Asian descent. This casting decision sparked outrage and frustration from many fans of the show, who felt that the movie had failed to accurately represent the characters and themes of the original series. These critics argued that the casting choices significantly undermined the original story's central themes of diversity and inclusivity.

Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force.

Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improvedon for nearly three hundred years.

Analysing valuable cosmic material from asteroid could shed light on the mysteries surrounding solar system and its origins 4.6 billion years ago.","output":"Hayabusa-2 to Collect Samples from Asteroid 1999JU3 In a remarkable feat of engineering, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is sending Hayabusa-2 on a four-year voyage to collect samples from asteroid 1999JU3, which it aims to land on sometime in 2018. The spacecraft is set to be launched into space in December 2014 on a rocket that will fling it into deep space where it will travel for the next four years. Once it lands, the spacecraft will collect samples that should be returned to Earth by the time Tokyo hosts the Olympics in 2020. This will be a historic achievement, marking the first time in history that a sample will be collected from an asteroid and brought back to Earth. The analysis of the valuable cosmic material from the asteroid could shed light on the mysteries surrounding our solar system and its origins 4.6 billion years ago. The mission will involve some formidable scientific challenges. Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that have no atmosphere, making it difficult to maintain a stable landing on their surface. With the help of a range of sophisticated equipment, Hayabusa-2 will have to navigate its way safely to the asteroid and then land without causing too much disturbance. It will then collect samples using a special impactor that will be shot at the asteroid to expose material beneath the surface. The samples will be brought back to Earth where they will be analyzed to determine the chemical composition of the asteroid. Scientists hope to discover new insights into the formation of our solar system and the conditions that existed 4.6 billion years ago when the planets began to form. The asteroid itself is just a few kilometers in diameter and relatively close to Earth, which makes it an ideal target for the mission. The Hayabusa-2 mission is a testament to the ingenuity of JAXA and the power of human curiosity.

The study concluded that patients assigned to rooms with windows allowing lots of natural light had shorter postoperative hospital stays, received fewer negative evaluative comments in nurses’ notes, and took fewer potent analegesics than 23 matched patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick wall.

Before setting sail, it is important to follow a few key steps to ensure the safety of yourself and others on board. One of the first steps when preparing to operate a boat with an outboard or inboard-outboard engine is to lower the lower unit. This helps to ensure that the propeller is fully submerged and able to propel the boat through the water. Before starting the engine, however, it is crucial to turn on the bilge blower to remove any gasoline fumes that may have accumulated in the bilge. This can prevent the risk of a fire or explosion occurring when the engine is started. Once the bilge blower has been turned on and there are no longer any fumes present, it is important to ensure that no person is near the engine when starting and that no person or boat is in your path before you put the boat in reverse. It is also essential to pay attention to currents, wind, and waves that can easily pull your boat off course and into a collision course with another boat or dock. Once everything is clear, it's time to crank the engine and get moving. However, before pulling out, it is important to secure the boat to the dock. Slowly pull the vehicle out, but keep in mind that when pulling away from the dock, the stern of the boat is pushed to one side or the other, unlike a car with a pivot point in the front.

Skim or skip over information you already know. Do not talk to yourself when you read. Avoid rereading phrases.","output":"Reading is a crucial skill that we need to master to become successful in our academic and professional lives. But just reading the words on the page is not enough. To maximize our comprehension of what we read, we need to practice reading techniques that enhance our focus, attention to detail, and overall speed. One such technique is varying our reading speed. When we read, our brain processes information at different speeds. Some sections require more attention, while others can be skimmed quickly. Skimming or skipping over information we already know allows us to focus on the critical details that we might have missed otherwise. By reading quickly, we can cover more material in less time, which is especially crucial when we have a lot of reading to do. Another technique to improve reading comprehension is avoiding talking to oneself while reading. This practice can be distracting and slow down the reading process, preventing us from retaining the information contained in the text. Instead, we must focus our attention on the text to understand and make sense of the content. Avoiding re-reading phrases is another reading technique that helps us maintain our focus and speed while reading. Re-reading the same phrase over and over again can waste precious time and cause our minds to wander, leading to lower comprehension of the text. Instead, we must read every phrase only one time and try to absorb as much information as possible. In conclusion, by varying our reading speed, skimming or skipping over information we already know, and avoiding talking to ourselves while reading, we can enhance our reading skills and increase our reading speed while maintaining high comprehension. Additionally, avoiding re-reading phrases helps us keep our focus and attention, allowing for a more efficient reading experience. So, the next time you sit down to read, keep these simple tips in mind, and enjoy a more productive reading session."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: Who caught the longest touchdown pass?","output":"The record for the longest touchdown pass in NFL history belongs to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady and former Patriots wide receiver Randy Moss.

While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence.

Revelation unearthed by a historian who has reexamined royal records into the life of Henry VIII's famous mistress Bessie. Blount. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Elizabeth Tailboys, also known as Bessie Blount, was a mistress of King Henry VIII and could have changed the course of English history if the King had acknowledged her as his rightful heir. This revelation was uncovered by a historian who re-examined royal records into the life of Bessie. Bessie Blount was a lady-in-waiting at the court of King Henry VIII and caught his eye when she was just a teenager. She became his mistress and bore him a son, Henry Fitzroy, in 1519. However, the King did not acknowledge Fitzroy as his legitimate heir and instead married six times in his quest for a male heir. According to the historian’s findings, if Henry VIII had acknowledged Fitzroy as his rightful heir, the course of English history would have been drastically altered. Fitzroy would have become King after Henry VIII's death, and his half-sister Queen Mary and half-brother King Edward VI would not have inherited the throne. This would have also prevented the Tudor dynasty from falling into the hands of the Stuart family after Queen Elizabeth I's death. Bessie Blount was a significant figure in Henry VIII's life, and her son Henry Fitzroy was one of the most important people in Tudor England. However, her role in English history has been largely overshadowed by the more famous mistresses of Henry VIII, including Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. In conclusion, Elizabeth Tailboys, also known as Bessie Blount, could have had a significant impact on English history if King Henry VIII had acknowledged her son as his legitimate heir. This revelation sheds new light on the Tudor dynasty and the role of Bessie Blount in Henry VIII's life. It is a reminder that history is not always set in stone and that even minor events can have profound effects on the course of history."},{"instruction":"ell's Kitchen (U.S. season 18) Hell's Kitchen: Rookies vs Veterans is the eighteenth season of the American competitive reality television series Hell's Kitchen and premiered on September 28, 2018, on Fox.
