Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert.

Apply baking soda to get the splinter out. Use ichthammol ointment to remove the splinter. Apply epsom salts to the splinter.","output":"When dealing with a splinter, it can be a painful and frustrating experience. Though there are many methods to remove a splinter, some may not always work for everyone. Here are a few solutions to examine: Firstly, take a close look at the splinter. If it is visible, try using a pair of tweezers to gently pull it out in the direction it entered the skin. Be careful not to break the splinter and push it further into the skin. If the splinter is not visible, try using tape to remove it. Place a piece of tape over the area and press down firmly, then gently pull the tape off in the opposite direction of the splinter’s entry. The tape should pull the splinter along with it. Another solution is to use glue. Apply a small amount of glue to the affected area, and let it dry. Once dried, gently pull the glue off, and the splinter should come out with it. Baking soda can also help in removing a splinter. Mix a small amount of baking soda with water to create a paste, and apply it to the area. Cover it with a bandage or let it dry, then remove the bandage or dried paste to expose the splinter, which should be easier to remove now. Another option is ichthammol ointment. Apply a small amount of the ointment to the area, and cover it with a bandage. Allow time for it to seep into the skin, and once you remove the bandage, the splinter will be more visible and easier to remove. Lastly, epsom salts can be used to treat the affected area. Mix a small amount of epsom salts with water to create a paste, and apply it to the area. Let it dry for a couple of hours before removing it, and the splinter should naturally come out. In conclusion, removing a splinter can be a frustrating experience, but with these methods, you can find a solution that works for you.

In chickens it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen's oviduct during the passage of the egg. It forms around fertilized or unfertilized egg yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the embryo (when fertilized).

Check to see if the trinomial is a perfect square. Check whether no solution exists.","output":"When working with mathematical problems, there are often different checks we need to perform to ensure our solutions are accurate. Three important checks to use in problem-solving are checking for prime numbers, checking if the trinomial is a perfect square, and checking if no solution exists. Firstly, checking for prime numbers is crucial when dealing with factors or multiples. A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. By checking if a number is prime, we can determine if it has any other factors or is a multiple of another number. This check can help us simplify and reduce fractions, factorize equations, or determine if an equation has any solutions. Secondly, checking if a trinomial is a perfect square is essential when working with quadratic equations. A perfect square trinomial is a quadratic equation that can be factored into two identical brackets. This check can help simplify complicated quadratic expressions and determine whether an equation has any rational solutions. If a trinomial is not a perfect square, it may require complex roots or may have no real solutions. Lastly, checking whether no solution exists is a critical step in verifying the correctness of our solutions. Sometimes, no solution exists for a problem, and this check is necessary to avoid any mathematical errors. For example, if we are solving an equation with two variables and after substitution, we end up with an impossible equation, we can conclude that no solutions exist. This check can help avoid illogical answers or nonsensical results. In conclusion, by using these checks in our problem-solving process, we can ensure that our solutions are accurate and logical. Checking for prime numbers, perfect square trinomials, and the possibility of no solution can significantly simplify complex mathematical problems and reduce the likelihood of errors."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: who did the seahawks play in the super bowl?","output":"The Seahawks played against the Patriots in the Super Bowl."},{"instruction":"Solve 19*b + 11 = 11 for b.","output":"First, we can isolate the variable b on one side of the equation by adding 19b to both sides: -19b + 11 + 19b = 11 + 19b Simplifying the left side of the equation gives: 11 = 11 + 19b We can then simplify the right side by subtracting 11 from both sides: 0 = 19b Finally, we can solve for b by dividing both sides by 19: b = 0/19 b = 0 Therefore, the solution is b = 0."},{"instruction":"WiththeFrenchRevolutioncamealiberationofthearts,whichJuelhadwitnessedduringhismanyyearstravellingabroad,andhewasthereforeabletoliveuptothe,forthetime,moderndemandsandexpectationsofart,whichwerealsoemerginginDenmark.Interestintheprivatesphere,familybonds,andthefreerexpressiongrantedtochildrenweretendenciesthatwerepopularatthetimeandaredepictedinthepainting.

One of the best ways to handle stamps is to use stamp tongs, which are small and delicate tools that allow you to pick up and move stamps without damaging them. When it comes to preparing stamps for your collection, it's important to take care when removing them from envelopes or package. It's recommended to cut off most of the envelope to prevent tearing the stamp while removing it. Next, soak most stamps in lukewarm water to remove any glue or debris. After soaking, rinse and dry the stamps carefully on a paper towel or drying book. This process will further prevent damage to your stamps by removing any dirt, dust, or grime that might be attached to them. For self-adhesive stamps, a simple trick is to use air freshener to remove them from the envelope. Simply spray a small amount of air freshener onto the back of the stamp and wait for it to loosen before carefully peeling it off. In conclusion, handling stamps with care can help ensure that your stamp collection is preserved and valuable for years to come.

It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest.

Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field.

Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows. Mammals take oxygen into their lungs, and discard carbon dioxide.","output":"Title: The Mechanism of Breathing in Mammals."},{"instruction":"1.

Within a few minutes, the bread usually turns rubbery and even tougher than before. This is the fastest method, but it's best to save it for an immediate snack. This happens because the microwave boils away some of the water. The escaping steam pushes the starches into a denser structure, and leaves the bread dry. Slow heating in small increments can reduce this effect, but it's difficult to find a sweet spot that's still hot enough to soften the bread. Lightly dampen a plain, white paper towel.

If your kitten has been showing signs of lethargy, disinterest in play or socializing, or hiding, it might be a sign that they are feeling low. The best way to combat your kitten's depression is by spending more time with them. Cats are social animals, and they crave human interaction. Try to play with your kitten regularly or even set aside special times in the day to give them the attention they need.

Use data and expert opinion to compare the catches and determine which one was longer. 3. Examine the impact of Welker and Watson's first half touchdown catches on their teams' performances. For example, how did the catches affect the momentum, morale, and strategy of the teams? How did the players' roles and contributions throughout the game make a difference?

Instead, the focus should be on how the actions or words of the person affected you emotionally. By doing this, you emphasize the underlying issue and create a platform for a constructive discussion. It is essential to work together towards a compromise that will benefit both parties. Providing a fix for the problem will help prevent the situation from resurfacing in the future. It is critical also to employ active listening techniques and recognize the other person's perspective. Understanding each other's views will create a more profound sense of mutual respect and esteem in the relationship.

Acknowledging your part in a misunderstanding or conflict can signify your willingness to make amends and rebuild the relationship.

The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membranebound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S.

Lee Hee-ho had visited North Korea with her husband in 2000 for a historic summit with Kim Jong Il, which resulted in a joint declaration of peace between the two countries. Hyun Jeong-eun had previously invested heavily in business ventures in North Korea, including a tourism project at the Mount Kumgang resort. Their visit was seen as a symbolic gesture of reconciliation between the two Koreas, which have been separated by a heavily fortified border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.

Every bit of experience you gain will help shape your skills and build your resume. Don’t be afraid to start small and work your way up. Once you have begun to gain some experience, it is important to get an agent. An agent can help you find auditions and negotiate contracts on your behalf. However, be cautious in choosing an agent and do your research to make sure they have a good reputation and are a good fit for you. Networking is also crucial in Hollywood. Attend industry events, meet and greet with other industry professionals, and make connections wherever you can. Building relationships with other performers, agents, managers, and casting directors can lead to valuable opportunities.

To start, take a coffee filter and fold it into eighths. This will create a small triangular shape that will ultimately become the center of the flower. Next, try folding a few coffee filters differently to create a variety of petal shapes. You can fold them in halves, quarters, or even create accordion folds for a more intricate look. Once you have your petals ready, it’s time to shape them. Gently curve the edges of the petals to create a natural-looking flow. Now it’s time to start assembling the flower. Take your center piece and fold it in half to create a crease. This will serve as your starting point. Add the first petal to the center, using glue or a small piece of double-sided tape to secure it in place. Continue adding petals one-by-one, making sure to overlap them slightly for a fuller look. Finally, add any finishing touches such as a small piece of felt to serve as the stem, or a spritz of floral spray to give it a fresh-from-the-garden scent. In just a few easy steps, you can create a beautiful and unique decoration that will brighten up any room.

A new study finds that dogs are able to pick up on friend or foe depending on whether a tail is wagging to the left or right, reports the BBC. Research from a few years back suggested that a dog wagged to its right when it was happy and friendly and to the left when it sensed danger. The new research, which involved measuring heart rates and such, shows that dogs themselves are able to pick up on the differences. It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions, says the lead Italian researcher. Here we attempted to look at it in other species. One part that's a wee bit disappointing: He doesn't think the dogs are intentionally communicating with each other, reports National Geographic. But they have apparently learned how to process the visual cue over eons.

However, her dream vacation quickly turned into a nightmare when her friend, who was supposed to travel with her, dropped out at the last minute. Sierra decided to go anyway, hoping to use the opportunity to take stunning photos and explore the country on her own. The trip started off well, with Sierra sharing photos on social media of her sightseeing adventures. However, things took a tragic turn when she failed to board her flight from Istanbul to Newark International Airport on January 21, 2013. Concerned, her family in New York tried to contact her, but they couldn't reach her. Sierra's brother and husband immediately flew to Europe to conduct a search for her. They retraced her steps in Istanbul and shared flyers with her photo, hoping to gather any clues or information from locals. Despite their efforts, Sierra was nowhere to be found. Days turned into weeks, and the search for Sierra continued. Her family and friends organized vigils and fundraisers to raise awareness about her disappearance. The case received media attention in both Turkey and the United States, with authorities in both countries launching investigations. Finally, on February 2, 2013, Sierra's body was found by a local resident near the ancient city walls of Istanbul. She had suffered head trauma and multiple stab wounds. Turkish authorities quickly opened a homicide investigation, and several suspects were arrested. The death of Sarai Sierra sent shockwaves through her community and beyond. Her family, friends, and loved ones were devastated by the loss of a vibrant, young woman who was passionate about photography and travel. Her tragic story serves as a reminder of the dangers that can accompany solo travel, and the importance of staying aware and connected while exploring new places. In honor of Sierra's memory, her family established the Sarai Sierra Scholarship Fund, which supports young women pursuing degrees in visual arts or photography.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A Canadian woman, Tabitha Leah Ritchie, was detained by Colombian police after they discovered she was attempting to smuggle over four pounds of cocaine into the country. Ritchie, who is a social worker, had placed the drugs under a latex belly in an attempt to conceal them. However, an inspector noticed that her stomach felt unnaturally hard and cold, leading to the discovery of the hidden narcotics. Ritchie had arrived in Colombia on August 6 and was scheduled to leave the country in just a few days when she was caught. The Canadian government has stated that they are aware of Ritchie's arrest and are offering her consular assistance. This is not the first time a person has attempted to smuggle drugs by concealing them under a fake belly. In 2011, a man was caught in Spain after he tried to smuggle cocaine under a prosthetic stomach, while in 2016, a woman was caught in New Zealand trying to smuggle drugs in a fake pregnant belly. The incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing battle against drug trafficking and the creative tactics used by smugglers to conceal their illegal activities. Colombia, in particular, has been on the front lines of this struggle, as it is one of the world's largest producers of cocaine. The detention of Tabitha Leah Ritchie shows that despite the efforts of law enforcement officials, drug smugglers continue to find new and inventive ways to try and evade detection. It also underscores the importance of international cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking, as this issue affects not only Colombia but countries around the world."},{"instruction":"Q: when did ncaa tourney expand to 64 teams?","output":"1985."},{"instruction":"Police are trying to identify two children found wandering the streets alone.

Will rise by up to 5.6% next year total increase of 24% since last election. Labour calling for reform of 'broken market' including capping of fare rises. Shadow Transport Secretary: 'Our rail fares are among highest in Europe'","output":"Rail Fares Set to Increase by 24% in the Next Four Years It is bad news for commuters and travellers as rail fares are expected to increase by about a quarter over the next four years. The government has announced a rise of up to 5.6% in fares for next year alone, which will add to the total increase of 24% since the last election. This means that people will have to pay more for their daily commute and travel, putting extra strain on already stretched budgets. The opposition party, Labour, has been voicing its concern over the rising fares and is calling for a reform of the 'broken market'. This includes the capping of the fare rises, which is currently not guaranteed by any government regulation. The Shadow Transport Secretary points out that the current rail fares are among the highest in Europe, yet the service is not commensurate with the exorbitant price. It is not surprising to learn that people are losing faith in the rail system. The overcrowding, delays and cancellations are all adding to the misery of an already expensive service. The quality of service does not reflect the prices charged, which is why there is a growing demand of passengers for better value for their money. The government must take a serious look at the issue of rising fares and the quality of service. It is not enough to keep raising the costs and blaming external factors, such as inflation or maintenance costs. Instead, there needs to be a comprehensive reform of the rail system to ensure that the costs are reasonable and the service is reliable and efficient. In conclusion, rail fares are set to increase by 24% over the next four years, which will put a further strain on the already overburdened commuters and travellers. Labour is calling for a reform of the 'broken market' which includes the capping of fare rises, and it is high time that the government takes the necessary steps to ensure that passengers receive value for their money.

To begin, take the battery out of its packaging. Depending on the model of your Chromebook, the battery may be pre-installed or separate. If it's separate, you'll find it in a small box or package inside the Chromebook box. Once you have the battery in hand, take a moment to inspect it. Check for any signs of damage or defects, such as cracks, leaks, or bulges. If you see any of these issues, do not attempt to insert the battery into your device. Instead, contact the manufacturer for assistance. Assuming that the battery is in good shape, you can proceed to insert it into your Chromebook. Look for the battery compartment on the underside of the device. Depending on the model, this may be a small door or a slot that requires a little bit of pressure to open. Carefully insert the battery into the compartment, making sure that it's oriented correctly. There should be clear markings on the battery and the compartment to guide you. Once the battery is in place, you'll need to close the compartment securely. Again, the method for doing so will depend on your specific Chromebook model. With the battery installed, you're one step closer to using your new Chromebook! Before you power it on, though, take a moment to verify that the battery is properly seated and that there are no loose connections. You should also make sure that the battery is fully charged before using the device for the first time.

By following these steps carefully and inspecting the battery for damage before you install it, you can ensure that your device is safe and functioning correctly."},{"instruction":"eliasonera ab , the nordic region 's largest telecommunications group , said monday that it is suing russian rival alfa group in an ongoing battle over control of the turkish mobile phone company turkcell .

While the dog was being examined, the man himself started to have a seizure. Doctors later learned that the man had smoked synthetic marijuana called 'Crazy Monkey.' The man would not reveal how his dog ingested the substance. This incident highlights the dangers of synthetic marijuana, which can cause serious health problems and even death. Synthetic marijuana is made from chemicals that are similar to the active ingredient in marijuana. However, the effects of synthetic marijuana can be much stronger and more dangerous than natural marijuana. This week, 15 people in New York City were hospitalized after using synthetic marijuana. The side effects of synthetic marijuana can include seizures, hallucinations, paranoia, and heart problems. In some cases, the drug can cause long-term damage to the brain and other organs. Crazy Monkey, the synthetic marijuana that the man in the veterinarian's office smoked, retails for about 60 online. However, no amount of money is worth risking your health and your life for.

With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest impact of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks.

Sweep the light back and forth, checking various surfaces. Mark the edges of the stain so you’ll know where to find it.","output":"If you have pets at home, it's no secret that accidents can happen. Whether you're potty training a new puppy or dealing with an elderly cat that's experiencing bladder problems, one issue that often arises is tracking down urine stains on your carpet or furniture. Fortunately, there's a solution that can make the process much easier: a UV light. To find urine stains with a UV light, you'll need to purchase or borrow one that has a wavelength between 365-385 nm. These lights can typically be found at hardware or pet supply stores, and they work by illuminating any urine on a surface, making it visible to the naked eye. Once you have your UV light, you'll want to wait until evening and get the room as dark as possible. This will help ensure that the stain is more visible when you turn on the light. If possible, close any blinds or curtains to block out as much natural light as you can. Next, head to the area where you suspect the urine is located and turn on the UV light. The light will likely emit a purple or blue hue, but don't let that distract you. Instead, look for a glowing yellow or neon green spot. This will be the urine stain you're after. As you're shining the light around, be sure to sweep it back and forth, checking various surfaces. Urine can end up on floors, walls, furniture, and even curtains or clothing, so make sure to cast a wide net. You may need to move furniture or other objects out of the way to get a better view. Once you spot a stain, mark the edges with a piece of tape or a marker. This will help you find it again if you need to treat the area. You can then proceed with cleaning the stain according to your preferred method. Overall, using a UV light to find urine stains can be a game-changer for pet owners. Not only does it make finding the stain easier, but it can also help you identify areas where your pet may need more training or medical attention. So if you're struggling to locate urine stains in your home, give a UV light a try and see how much easier it can make the process."},{"instruction":"This is a test of commonsense.

Tie your dominant hand behind your back to be even more immersive.","output":"Strengthen Your Non-Dominant Hand and Fingers through Exercises Our dominant hand and fingers tend to get most of the attention and use in our daily lives. However, strengthening our non-dominant hand and fingers can have multiple benefits, including increased dexterity and improved brain function. Here are a few exercises you can try to strengthen your non-dominant hand and fingers: 1. Finger Extension and Flexion: Spread your fingers apart as far as you can and then bring them back together. Repeat this motion multiple times to exercise your fingers. 2. Finger Taps: Tap your fingers on a flat surface like a tabletop or keyboard rapidly. Do this for a minute or two to give your fingers a thorough workout. 3. Wrist Curls: Hold a small weight or a can of soup in your hand and slowly raise and lower your wrist. This exercise helps build strength in your wrist and forearm. Using Your Non-Dominant Hand for Daily Tasks One way to train your non-dominant hand is to incorporate it into your daily activities. Here are a few ways to start: 1. Computer Mouse: Use your non-dominant hand to work the computer mouse. This exercise can improve your mouse skills while building your non-dominant hand's strength. 2. Daily Tasks: Start performing small daily tasks with your non-dominant hand, like brushing your teeth or opening doors. This exercise can challenge your mind and help you build a new skill. 3. Eat and Cook: After a few days of using your non-dominant hand for small tasks, try eating or cooking with your non-dominant hand. It may feel awkward at first, but with practice, it can become more natural. Tie Your Dominant Hand Behind Your Back For a more immersive experience, try tying your dominant hand behind your back.

The next day I was thinking about it again, because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining, you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story. How one person can be seen as the link to so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded so many things. And how Diane Keaton's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there.

According to Aburish, after assuming power, Nasser and the Free Officers expected to become the guardians of the people's interests against the monarchy and the pasha class while leaving the daytoday tasks of government to civilians. They asked former prime minister Ali Maher to accept reappointment to his previous position, and to form an allcivilian cabinet. The Free Officers then governed as the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) with Naguib as chairman and Nasser as vicechairman. Relations between the RCC and Maher grew tense, however, as the latter viewed many of Nasser's schemes—agrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, reorganization of political parties—as too radical, culminating in Maher's resignation on 7 September. Naguib assumed the additional role of prime minister, and Nasser that of deputy prime minister. In September, the Agrarian Reform Law was put into effect.

Consequently, it's important to understand bra size determination and learn how to wear a bra. When it comes to bra sizing, it's essential to seek guidance from an expert. It's highly recommended that you ask your mom or another adult who can provide accurate information about puberty and bra sizing. This is because every girl's body is different, and the size of the bra varies greatly for each person. To determine your bra size, you need to measure your bust and rib cage. The bust size refers to the fullest part of your chest, whereas the rib cage is measured just below the breasts. The difference between these two measurements is what's used to determine the cup size. For instance, if the difference is one inch, the cup size is A. Two inches indicate a B cup size, three inches a C cup size, and so on. Once you know your bra size, the next step is to learn how to properly wear a bra. Start by fastening the bra on the loosest hook and adjusting the straps if necessary. Then, lean forward and adjust your breasts to make sure they fit comfortably in the cups. Finally, stand upright and ensure that the band is level and not too tight or too loose. It's important to keep in mind that different types of bras may require slightly different methods of wearing. In conclusion, understanding how bra size is determined and learning how to wear a bra properly is essential for every girl going through puberty. Seek advice from a trusted adult and embrace this stage of your life with confidence.

The laws are set to be relaxed for New Years Eve this year, with patrons able to enter venues until 3am in order to reduce congestion. Daniel's family say that the relaxation of the laws sends the wrong message and that they are disappointed with the decision. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Last year, the tragic death of 18-year-old Daniel Christie shook the city of Sydney. Christie was fatally punched in the head by MMA fighter Shaun McNeil on New Year's Eve, and died after 11 days in hospital. The incident sparked a wave of outrage and prompted the introduction of stricter lockout laws, aimed at reducing alcohol-related violence and improving safety in the city's nightlife precincts. Since the implementation of the lockout laws, there has been a significant reduction in alcohol-related assaults, with rates falling by 40 percent. However, with New Year's Eve quickly approaching, the laws are set to be relaxed for one night only. Patrons will be able to enter venues until 3am, in an attempt to reduce congestion and allow more people to enjoy the celebrations. While some have welcomed the relaxation of the laws, others, including Daniel Christie's family, have criticized the decision. They argue that it sends the wrong message and undermines the effectiveness of the lockout laws. \\"It's disappointing to see that the lessons of Daniel's death have not been fully learned,\\" his family said in a statement. The debate over the lockout laws is a complex one, with many different factors to consider. On the one hand, there is no doubt that the laws have had a positive impact on reducing violence and disorder. On the other hand, there are concerns about the impact on businesses, as well as questions around individual freedoms and the right to enjoy the city's nightlife. As we approach New Year's Eve, it's important that we continue to have these conversations and explore ways to balance the competing interests at play. While we all want to have a good time and celebrate, we must also remember the tragic loss of Daniel Christie and ensure that we are doing everything we can to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences mean the same thing?
