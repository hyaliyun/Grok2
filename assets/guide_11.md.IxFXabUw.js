Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Javier Adelmar Zanetti was born in Buenos Aires with Italian origins to working-class parents and grew up in the harbour area in the Dock Sud district, one of the city's most notorious areas. His father Rodolfo was a bricklayer and his mother Violeta Bonnazola was a cleaner. He began playing football on a field in the city suburbs, maintaining the pitch in his spare time. When he was a teenager, he tried out for local club Independiente's youth academy but was ultimately rejected and told that he lacked the physique to succeed in the game. After the arrival of Maicon at the beginning of the 2006-07 season, Zanetti was moved from the right-back position into midfield. He ended a four-year goal drought when he scored on 5 November 2006 at a home match against Ascoli, having previously scored on 6 November 2002 at an away match against Empoli. On 27 September 2006, against Bayern Munich, Zanetti played his 500th professional match for Inter and on 22 November 2006, he appeared in his 100th UEFA match, against Sporting Clube de Portugal.  Zanetti celebrated his 600th match for Inter on 24 September 2008 with a 1-0 win over newly promoted Lecce. Minutes before the match, he was presented with a commemorative plate by former vice-captain Ivan Cordoba to mark the occasion.  Though Zanetti is more often classified as a defender, he played mostly in midfield during the first half of the 2008-09 season. For the last several weeks of October 2008, with Inter coach Jose Mourinho facing a midfield crisis due to injuries to key midfielders Esteban Cambiasso and Sulley Muntari, he was moved again to the midfield for the matches against Genoa and Fiorentina. During that period, Mourinho played him in the midfield due to the presence of Maicon, Lucio, Walter Samuel and Cristian Chivu in the back four.  The 2009-10 season began well for Zanetti and Inter, especially after a 4-0 thrashing of crosstown rivals Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. In the match against Genoa on 17 October, he started off the counter-attack that led to Inter's second goal after dispossessing a Genoa player. Inter became the first team of the season to win by a five-goal margin. On 24 October, he reached Giacinto Facchetti's record of 476 Serie A appearances when he turned out for the match against Catania, which ended in a 2-1 win for the Nerazzurri. He also currently holds a club record of 149 consecutive appearances.  Inter won the 2010 Champions League final 2-0 against Bayern Munich on 22 May 2010. This was Zanetti's 700th appearance for Inter, and it made him the first player to captain an Italian club to a treble of the Scudetto, Coppa Italia and Champions League. Did he win a lot","output":"Yes, Javier Zanetti won a lot in his football career. For example, during the 2009-2010 season, he helped his team, Inter, win three big titles: the Italian Championship (Scudetto), the Italian Cup (Coppa Italia), and the European Championship (Champions League). He was the first captain of an Italian club to win all three in the same season!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who used a Fender Stratocaster during the recording of the Help! , can you please find it?   When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine. He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on \\"She Loves You\\", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the Help! album that February; he also used it when recording Rubber Soul later that year, most notably on the song \\"Nowhere Man\\".In early 1966 Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on Revolver. Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word \\"Bebopalula\\" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, \\"Rocky\\", on the headstock. He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul, which Harrison nicknamed \\"Lucy\\". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a \\"Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster\\" modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation?  St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs.

Background: Me and Orson Welles is a 2008 British-American period drama film directed by Richard Linklater and starring Zac Efron, Christian McKay, and Claire Danes. Based on Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name, the story, set in 1937 New York, tells of a teenager hired to perform in Orson Welles's groundbreaking stage adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. He becomes attracted to a career-driven production assistant. The film was shot in London and New York and on the Isle of Man in February, March and April 2008, and was released in the United States on November 25, 2009, and the United Kingdom on December 4, 2009. Context: Select footage of Me and Orson Welles was screened at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival where financing and sales agency Cinetic Media were looking to sell the film to a distributor. Before its Cannes premiere, The Hollywood Reporter predicted that the film would attract distributors with Linklater's resume and Efron's teen \\"heartthrob\\" status to appeal to a younger demographic, but Me and Orson Welles failed to secure any American acquisitions. Its first full screening was at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, running September 4-13, 2008. In spite of its failure to find a buyer at Cannes, Toronto's co-director Cameron Bailey predicted that it would be \\"one of the hottest films\\" in the lineup, Anne Thompson of Variety magazine also believed that the film would be one of \\"only a few lucky winners\\" to secure a seven-figure deal.  Again, however, the film's distribution rights were not purchased and it went on to show at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. In May 2009, production company CinemaNX announced that it would distribute Me and Orson Welles itself, sharing marketing and advertising costs with Vue Entertainment. Freestyle Releasing was hired as the US distributor with Hart/Lunsford Pictures in exchange for participation in revenues paid the 4 million prints and advertising cost.  It was screened at the Woodstock Film Festival in September 2009, where Linklater was honored as the winner of the 2009 Maverick Award. it opened the New Orleans Film Festival on October 9, 2009; and it was screened at the St. Louis International Film Festival in November 2009.  The film was released in the US on November 25, 2009, and in the UK on December 4, 2009. IndieWIRE reported, \\"The do-it-yourself release of Richard Linklater's Me and Orson Welles got off to a very nice start, averaging 15,910 from its four theaters, the highest PTA of all debuting films. ...

Step 2: Calculate the remaining runs needed to reach the target. Total target is 282 runs. Therefore, remaining runs needed = total target - runs already scored = 282 - 34 = 248 runs.

The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon.

The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\\" Trout said Tuesday. \\"This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\\" The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than 35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is 100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services.

Plot title: Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back Movie plot: The film opens in the early 1970s in front of the Quick Stop Groceries and the Record Rack stores in Leonardo, NJ. A kindly mother leaves a stroller with her toddler son, Bob, in front of the store while she goes inside to buy food. She gives the boy a baseball cap that she puts on his head with the visor turned backwards. Another mother, more foulmouthed and demeaning toward her own toddler, Jay, leaves her stroller in front of the store while she goes into the record store to score drugs. A man walks out & asks her who'll be watching the kids while their mothers are inside. The woman lets loose with a torrent of foul language, laced liberally with the F-word, attacking the man for questioning how she raises her kid. The guy walks away, disgusted The child of the foul-mouthed mother stands up in his stroller and begins to recite the F-word in rhythmic fashion and the scene dissolves to the two boys as young adults; they have grown up to become the foul-mouthed Jay and his taciturn companion, Silent Bob. The duo stand in front of the stores (the Quick Stop is still there but the record store has changed to RST Video) most days and deal drugs.

Drugs are substances that change a person's mental or physical state. They can affect how your brain works, how you feel and behave, your understanding, and your senses. Although there might be several correct answers, you need to write one of them. Problem:Four Chinese female patients who suffered from manic-depressive disorder and underlying autoimmune thyroiditis developed transient episodes of thyrotoxicosis during maintenance lithium therapy. Solution:","output":"The primary drug or medicine mentioned in the provided sentence is \\"Lithium.\\" Lithium is often used for the treatment of mood disorders such as manic-depressive disorder, also known as bipolar disorder. It functions by influencing the flow of sodium through nerve and muscle cells in the body, and sodium affects excitation or mania. It's important to note that lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, which means the difference between a therapeutic dose and a toxic dose is quite small. Lithium toxicity can occur if you take only slightly more than a recommended dose. In the context of the sentence, it's stated that patients were taking lithium for maintenance therapy of their manic-depressive disorder. However, they developed transient episodes of thyrotoxicosis, which is a condition characterized by an excessive amount of thyroid hormones in the body. Lithium is known to affect thyroid function and can cause different types of thyroid disorders. While lithium is effective in managing mood disorders, its administration needs careful monitoring due to its potential side effects, which in this case manifested as thyrotoxicosis in the patients who also had underlying autoimmune thyroiditis. This may require careful consideration and monitoring in the medical management of patients with similar conditions.

A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses.

(Associated Press)      RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The city of Norfolk has agreed to pay 4.9 million to four former sailors who were wrongly convicted of a woman's rape and murder based on intimidating police interrogations. A copy of the settlement agreement for the \\"Norfolk Four\\" was obtained by The Associated Press.      The state also has agreed to pay 3.5 million.      The payments close out a decades-long case that drew widespread attention as the men's innocence claims were backed by dozens of former FBI agents, ex-prosecutors and crime novelist John Grisham.      \\"These guys can now put all this behind them and try to recoup their lives,\\" said Tony Troy, a lawyer who represented one of the sailors.      The men — Eric Wilson, Danial Williams, Joseph Dick and Derek Tice — were pardoned by then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year of the 1997 rape and murder of Michelle Moore-Bosko.      Moore-Bosko's husband found her stabbed and strangled body in their apartment in July of that year after returning from a week at sea.      Williams, who lived in the same building, was quickly identified as a suspect because a neighbor told police he had a crush on the victim. Williams admitted to her rape and murder — the first of a series of confessions that the men, then-sailors at the Naval base in Norfolk, say were forced by police.      DNA evidence matched only one person: Omar Ballard, the fifth man convicted in the case. Ballard, who pleaded guilty in 2000, acknowledged he was solely responsible and is serving a life sentence.      The Norfolk Four have said they cracked after they were threatened with the death penalty and repeatedly called liars. One of the men recalled a detective shoving him into a corner and showing him a picture of Moore-Bosko's bloody body. The confessions conflicted with one another. Ballard's account was the only one containing information matching the crime scene.      The detective who questioned them, Robert Glenn Ford, was convicted in 2011 of extortion and lying to the FBI in unrelated cases.      In vacating some of the Norfolk Four's convictions, a federal judge once declared that \\"no sane human being\\" could find them guilty.      Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam approved legislation earlier this year that gives the men 3.5 million in state funds contingent on them resolving claims against the city.      Sen. Scott Surovell, a sponsor the legislation, said he was pleased that the city agreed to settle rather than fight the men.      \\"Justice was long overdue for these four, what happened to them was outrageous and undermines faith in our criminal justice system,\\" he said. \\"Hopefully this settlement will help ensure this never happens again.\\"      The settlement with the city was finalized a month ago but had not been previously made public. A city spokeswoman referred questions to the City Attorney Bernard Pishko, who did not immediately return requests for comment.

(Associated Press)      RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The city of Norfolk has agreed to pay 4.9 million to four former sailors who were wrongly convicted of a woman's rape and murder based on intimidating police interrogations. A copy of the settlement agreement for the \\"Norfolk Four\\" was obtained by The Associated Press.      The state also has agreed to pay 3.5 million.      The payments close out a decades-long case that drew widespread attention as the men's innocence claims were backed by dozens of former FBI agents, ex-prosecutors and crime novelist John Grisham.      \\"These guys can now put all this behind them and try to recoup their lives,\\" said Tony Troy, a lawyer who represented one of the sailors.      The men — Eric Wilson, Danial Williams, Joseph Dick and Derek Tice — were pardoned by then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year of the 1997 rape and murder of Michelle Moore-Bosko.      Moore-Bosko's husband found her stabbed and strangled body in their apartment in July of that year after returning from a week at sea.      Williams, who lived in the same building, was quickly identified as a suspect because a neighbor told police he had a crush on the victim. Williams admitted to her rape and murder — the first of a series of confessions that the men, then-sailors at the Naval base in Norfolk, say were forced by police.      DNA evidence matched only one person: Omar Ballard, the fifth man convicted in the case. Ballard, who pleaded guilty in 2000, acknowledged he was solely responsible and is serving a life sentence.      The Norfolk Four have said they cracked after they were threatened with the death penalty and repeatedly called liars. One of the men recalled a detective shoving him into a corner and showing him a picture of Moore-Bosko's bloody body. The confessions conflicted with one another. Ballard's account was the only one containing information matching the crime scene.      The detective who questioned them, Robert Glenn Ford, was convicted in 2011 of extortion and lying to the FBI in unrelated cases.      In vacating some of the Norfolk Four's convictions, a federal judge once declared that \\"no sane human being\\" could find them guilty.      Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam approved legislation earlier this year that gives the men 3.5 million in state funds contingent on them resolving claims against the city.      Sen. Scott Surovell, a sponsor the legislation, said he was pleased that the city agreed to settle rather than fight the men.      \\"Justice was long overdue for these four, what happened to them was outrageous and undermines faith in our criminal justice system,\\" he said. \\"Hopefully this settlement will help ensure this never happens again.\\"      The settlement with the city was finalized a month ago but had not been previously made public. A city spokeswoman referred questions to the City Attorney Bernard Pishko, who did not immediately return requests for comment.

Article: Travelling abroad for leisure is becoming more and more popular for Chinese. The UK is high up in the list of places that the Chinese want to visit. There is a sense of mystery about the UK; it's often the images of England's green parks, countryside and Victorian houses that people point to as an alternative to polluted, overcrowded cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. The capital is viewed as modern and dynamic, while being filled deep with history. When asked what other images are thought of by the UK, the reply is often \\"the Queen, tea and Oxbridge\\". So what's stopping them actually coming? Sebastian Wood ,the British ambassador in Beijing, has described the UK as a _ , and while this is perhaps an exaggeration ,Britain does have a reputation as a country that is harder to access. The main problem for Chinese tourists is obvious. Although visa applications are now completed online, visitors are still required to visit one of 12 UK centers across the country for a face-to-face interview and fingerprinting. If you don't live near one of these enters already, you'd have to travel some distance to get there. Another problem is also to be mentioned. If travelers from China visit the UK, they also want to cover as much ground as possible. But the UK is not included in the Schengen visa, which allows access to a host of 26 European countries such as France and Germany. So it makes the former seem a less worth it. There is also the issue of cost: PS47 for a Schengen visa, PS82 for the UK. On top of this, the UK is viewed as stricter in its handing of visas compared with the rest of Europe, fed by urban legends of rejected applications. In the end, the decision comes down to one question: Is Britain worth a visit? Question: What is the writer's attitude towards visiting the UK? Options: A: He really supports Chinese people to visit the UK. B: He suggests Chinese people visit London strongly. C: He thinks it is troublesome to visit the UK. D: He believes everyone should go to see the Queen and Oxbridge.

Adding the suffix results in the noun \\"influence.\\" 4. Verify if the newly formed noun is correct and in common use. Make sure the noun is grammatically correct and commonly used in the English language. It's helpful to check dictionaries and online resources to confirm the validity of the noun. - In our example, \\"influence\\" is already a valid noun and doesn't require a suffix. This shows that some words don't need to be changed to become a valid noun. For instance, the verb \\"perform\\" becomes the noun \\"performance\\" by adding the suffix \\"-ance.\\" 5. Practice converting verbs to nouns. To become proficient in this skill, practice converting various verbs to nouns using the suffixes \\"-ance\\" and \\"-ence.\\" This will help solidify your understanding of when and how to use these suffixes correctly. 6. Review irregular cases. There might be exceptions to these rules, so consider reviewing irregular cases and paying attention to the context in which the original verb is used. This will help ensure the accuracy of the conversion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. UNHCR, yıllık bazdaki %13'lük artışın, \\"kısmen Çinli ve Meksikalı sığınmacı sayısında meydana gelen artıştan\\" kaynaklandığını öne sürdü. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) asserted that the 13% annual increase was \\"partly due to the rise in the number of Chinese and Mexican asylum seekers\\".  In this sentence, the UNHCR, the United Nation's agency that is devoted to refugee matters, is suggesting that one of the reasons for a 13% increase on an annual basis in the given context is partially because there has been a growth in the number of individuals from China and Mexico seeking asylum. Asylum seekers are typically people who are seeking international protection but whose claim for refugee status has not yet been determined. Therefore, they are looking to be recognized as refugees and receive legal protection and material assistance from the UNHCR.  In order to understand this assertion more fully, it is necessary to know that an increase in asylum seekers from a particular country can often reflect socio-political conditions in that country, such as unrest, conflict, or persecution, causing citizens to flee and seek protection under refugee status in other countries. Thus, the statement implicates that there has likely been such a situation in China and Mexico causing an influx of asylum seekers from these countries. However, this sentence does not provide details about what exactly the 13% annual increase refers to. It might be referring to an overall global increase in asylum seekers or refugees, or perhaps an increase in a specific country or region. Those details could provide more context to understand the scale and impact of the increase in Chinese and Mexican asylum seekers. To summarize, the UNHCR is stating that the number of asylum seekers from China and Mexico has increased, contributing to a 13% increase in the overall figure (context not provided within the sentence) on an annual basis."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.  Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: Are you a global warming skeptic? There are plenty of good reasons why you might be. As many as 757 stations in the United States recorded net surface-temperature cooling over the past century. Many are concentrated in the southeast, where some people attribute tornadoes and hurricanes to warming. The temperature-station quality is largely awful. The most important stations in the U.S. are included in the Department of Energy's Historical Climatology Network. A careful survey of these stations by a team led by meteorologist Anthony Watts showed that 70% of these stations have such poor siting that, by the U.S. government's own measure, they result in temperature uncertainties of between two and five degrees Celsius or more. We do not know how much worse are the stations in the developing world. Using data from all these poor stations, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates an average global 0.64ºC temperature rise in the past 50 years, \\"most\\" of which the IPCC says is due to humans. Yet the margin of error for the stations is at least three times larger than the estimated warming. We know that cities show anomalous warming, caused by energy use and building materials; asphalt, for instance, absorbs more sunlight than do trees. Tokyo's temperature rose about 2ºC in the last 50 years. Could that rise, and increases in other urban areas, have been unreasonably included in the global estimates? That warming may be real, but it has nothing to do with the greenhouse effect and can't be addressed by carbon dioxide reduction. Moreover, the three major temperature analysis groups (the U.S.'s NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.K.'s Met Office and Climatic Research Unit) analyze only a small fraction of the available data, primarily from stations that have long records. There's a logic to that practice, but it could lead to selection bias. For instance, older stations were often built outside of cities but today are surrounded by buildings. These groups today use data from about 2,000 stations, down from roughly 6,000 in 1970, raising even more questions about their selections. On top of that, stations have moved, instruments have changed and local environments have evolved. Analysis groups try to compensate for all this by homogenizing the data, though there are plenty of arguments to be had over how best to homogenize long-running data taken from around the world in varying conditions. These adjustments often result in corrections of several tenths of one degree Celsius, significant fractions of the warming attributed to humans. And that's just the surface-temperature record. What about the rest? The number of named hurricanes has been on the rise for years, but that's in part a result of better detection technologies (satellites and buoys) that find storms in remote regions. The number of hurricanes hitting the U.S., even more intense Category 4 and 5 storms, has been gradually decreasing since 1850. The number of detected tornadoes has been increasing, possibly because radar technology has improved, but the number that touch down and cause damage has been decreasing. Meanwhile, the short-term variability in U.S. surface temperatures has been decreasing since 1800, suggesting a more stable climate. Without good answers to all these complaints, global-warming skepticism seems sensible. But now let me explain why you should not be a skeptic, at least not any longer. Over the last two years, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project has looked deeply at all the issues raised above. I chaired our group, which just submitted four detailed papers on our results to peer-reviewed journals. We have now posted these papers online at www.BerkeleyEarth.org to solicit even more scrutiny. Our work covers only land temperature—not the oceans—but that's where warming appears to be the greatest. Robert Rohde, our chief scientist, obtained more than 1.6 billion measurements from more than 39,000 temperature stations around the world. Many of the records were short in duration, and to use them Mr. Rohde and a team of esteemed scientists and statisticians developed a new analytical approach that let us incorporate fragments of records. By using data from virtually all the available stations, we avoided data-selection bias. Rather than try to correct for the discontinuities in the records, we simply sliced the records where the data cut off, thereby creating two records from one. We discovered that about one-third of the world's temperature stations have recorded cooling temperatures, and about two-thirds have recorded warming. The two-to-one ratio reflects global warming. The changes at the locations that showed warming were typically between 1-2ºC, much greater than the IPCC's average of 0.64ºC. To study urban-heating bias in temperature records, we used satellite determinations that subdivided the world into urban and rural areas. We then conducted a temperature analysis based solely on \\"very rural\\" locations, distant from urban ones. The result showed a temperature increase similar to that found by other groups. Only 0.5% of the globe is urbanized, so it makes sense that even a 2ºC rise in urban regions would contribute negligibly to the global average. What about poor station quality? Again, our statistical methods allowed us to analyze the U.S. temperature record separately for stations with good or acceptable rankings, and those with poor rankings (the U.S. is the only place in the world that ranks its temperature stations). Remarkably, the poorly ranked stations showed no greater temperature increases than the better ones. The mostly likely explanation is that while low-quality stations may give incorrect absolute temperatures, they still accurately track temperature changes. When we began our study, we felt that skeptics had raised legitimate issues, and we didn't know what we'd find. Our results turned out to be close to those published by prior groups. We think that means that those groups had truly been very careful in their work, despite their inability to convince some skeptics of that. They managed to avoid bias in their data selection, homogenization and other corrections. Global warming is real. Perhaps our results will help cool this portion of the climate debate. How much of the warming is due to humans and what will be the likely effects? We made no independent assessment of that.

Step 1: Define \\"pizzicato\\" Pizzicato is a technique used in playing stringed instruments, in which the performer plucks the strings with their fingers rather than using a bow. This results in a more percussive and lighter sound compared to the sustained sound produced by bowing. Step 2: Identify the types of instruments that can be played using the pizzicato technique Since pizzicato is a technique exclusive to stringed instruments, the type of instrument that can be played pizzicato includes the violin, viola, cello, and double bass. These four instruments are all members of the string family and typically played in orchestras or chamber music settings.

Article: In a broad sense, \\"sin\\" refers to anything that falls short of the holiness of God. The easiest to spot are usually actions, but sins can also include thoughts and attitudes.  Certain actions are considered sins, but the desire to perform those actions is sinful, as well. For instance, wanting to commit adultery is a sin just as actually committing adultery is. Temptation is not a sin, though. If you're put in a compromising situation with someone you find physically attractive, you may feel tempted to act on that attraction. Actually acting on that attraction and committing adultery as a result, or imagining the act of committing adultery even without doing it, is the sin. Simply feeling tempted to do so is not. Even though mankind was created in the image of God, the fall of Adam and Eve—the first humans—signified the fall of all humanity. As a result, humans are sinful by their very nature. In other words, you don't have to be taught how to sin. Sin is already firmly fixed inside of you at the very core of your being from the time of your birth. When Jesus died on the cross, He carried the sins of humanity with Him. Christ's sacrifice canceled out the debt of original sin. In the Old Testament, animal sacrifices were used as a way to repent for the sins of flesh. Even these sacrifices were imperfect, though, so the stain of original sin still remained. As both Son of God and Son of Man, Jesus became the “perfect sacrifice,” capable of freeing the human soul from the chains and punishment of original sin. \\" Accepting Christ and being freed from sin does not mean that you will never do another wicked thing ever again. Christ's sacrifice freed your spirit from the shackles of sin. Your flesh—including your body, mind, and heart—will still have to deal with everyday sin. Your soul can be free from sin even though your body still sins. Being free from sin on a soul level should mean that you also seek freedom from sin on a physical level, though, even though it can never be permanently reached. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses the concept of \\"sin\\" as actions, thoughts, and attitudes that fall short of the holiness of God. It explains that humans are sinful by nature due to the fall of Adam and Eve. The article also explores how Jesus' sacrifice on the cross canceled the debt of original sin, making Him the perfect sacrifice and freeing humans' souls from the chains of original sin. However, while one's soul may be free from sin through accepting Christ, the body, mind, and heart will continue to grapple with everyday sins. Believers should seek freedom from sin on a physical level, even though it can never be permanently achieved."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Galician.

Q: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

Movie title: Brotherhood of the Wolf Context: The film begins during the French Revolution, with the aged Marquis d'Apcher as the narrator, writing his memoirs in a castle, while the voices of a mob can be heard from outside. The film flashes back to 1764,[8] when a mysterious beast terrorized the province of GÃ©vaudan and nearby lands. GrÃ©goire de Fronsac, a knight and the royal naturalist of King Louis XV of France, and his Iroquois companion Mani, arrive in GÃ©vaudan to capture the beast. Upon arrival, they rescue Jean Chastel, an aged healer, and his daughter La Bavarde from an attack by soldiers. The young and enlightened ThomasâMarquis d'Apcherâlater befriends the two outsiders. Fronsac is initially skeptical about the beast's existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the bite size on a victim of the beast, he deduces that it must weigh roughly 500Â lb (227Â kg). Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but has not come close to the actual killer. While staying in GÃ©vaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-FranÃ§ois, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel. While investigating another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel, which increases his doubts of the beast's existence. Another witness swears that the beast is controlled by a human master. Fronsac studies the patterns of the attacks and victims, trying to find a common thread and reveal a murderer. As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king's weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives to put an end to the beast. However, instead of doing so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster accordingly.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This text is missing some spaces, please add them: BoostsStrength,StaminaandRecuperation.","output":"The given text seems to be conveying that the subject boosts strength, stamina, and recuperation. With proper spacing, the text should be written as, \\"Boosts Strength, Stamina, and Recuperation.\\" Now, allow me to provide a detailed explanation of these three attributes: 1. Strength: Strength refers to the physical power, typically in the context of muscles, with which an individual or item can exert force. It is a crucial component of overall physical fitness, as it is essential for completing tasks that require lifting, carrying, or pushing something. The ability to generate enough force to achieve such activities necessitates robust muscle groups that can efficiently contract and relax. Boosting one's strength often involves a combination of exercise, nutrition, and mental resilience. 2. Stamina: Stamina is the body's ability to endure prolonged periods of physical or mental exertion. It is an essential component of overall health, as it enables an individual to perform various activities effectively without succumbing to fatigue rapidly. Stamina is typically associated with aerobic fitness, such as running and cycling, but it can also pertain to anaerobic exercises like weight lifting. Boosting one's stamina usually involves a combination of cardiovascular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, proper nutrition, and adequate rest to ensure optimal recovery and performance. 3. Recuperation: Recuperation refers to the process by which the body recovers from physical or mental stress. This process is vital, as it allows the body to repair and rebuild damaged muscles, replenish energy stores, and maintain overall health. Efficient recuperation also reduces the risk of injuries and illnesses resulting from overtraining or excessive stress on the body.Boosting one's recuperation usually involves proper rest, sound nutrition, stress management, and adequate hydration. In conclusion, the original text highlights the significance of boosting strength, stamina, and recuperation for overall health and well-being. A well-rounded fitness regimen, combined with a balanced diet and self-care habits, can enhance these three attributes and contribute to improved physical and mental performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

The word is originally an agentive noun of the Latin verb docēre (dɔˈkeːrɛ) 'to teach'. It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctorates were awarded at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris. Having become established in European universities, this usage spread around the world. Contracted \`\`Dr'' or \`\`Dr.'', it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a Doctorate (e.g. PhD). In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether or not they hold a doctoral-level degree. Can we conclude that is a person with a phd a doctor?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that a person with a PhD is considered a doctor. This is because the term \\"doctor\\" is used to denote someone who has achieved the highest level of academic expertise in their field. A PhD, or Doctor of Philosophy, is typically the highest degree that can be awarded in various fields of study, such as humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and many other disciplines. Therefore, a person who has earned a PhD has demonstrated a deep understanding and mastery of their chosen subject, as well as the ability to conduct original research and contribute new knowledge to their field. When someone has earned a PhD, they are granted the title of \\"doctor,\\" which signifies their expertise and scholarly achievements. This title is used both within academia and in professional settings, as a form of respect and recognition for their accomplishments. It is important to note that the specific requirements and duration of a PhD program may vary, depending on the country, institution, and discipline. Generally, a PhD candidate is required to complete advanced coursework, carry out independent research, and write a dissertation that presents their findings to the academic community. However, it is also essential to understand that the term \\"doctor\\" is not exclusive to those who hold a PhD. As mentioned earlier, medical practitioners who may not necessarily hold a doctoral-level degree are often referred to as doctors. These professionals have completed medical school and earned degrees such as Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), which qualifies them to practice medicine. It is important to distinguish between medical doctors and those with a PhD, as their roles and expertise are different. In conclusion, a person with a PhD can indeed be referred to as a doctor, as this title recognizes their high level of academic achievement, knowledge, and expertise in their specific field. This usage is found around the world and across various disciplines, underscoring the importance and prestige associated with holding a doctoral degree. However, it is crucial to recognize that the title \\"doctor\\" can apply to both those with PhDs and medical practitioners, and one should be mindful of this distinction when addressing or referring to individuals with this title."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here, in her own words, she talks about the couple's devastating losses, how attending a memorial service for one of their lost babies helped them grieve and why they are not giving hope just yet. That feeling of lying on the bed waiting for the scan with Andrew sat next to me holding my hand, I'm just watching the faces of the hospital staff for any signs. It's a feeling of \\"here we go again\\". We're so used to this now, it's 10 times. I've probably had every type of management of a miscarriage. I've had a D and C (dilation and curettage) where they remove the embryo through surgery, I've gone into hospital and had tablets which help it come away and I've just come home and waited for it to happen naturally. None is any easier than the other. We'd always wanted our own family. Andrew and I have been married for 10 years and got together about 10 years before that. But I wanted to get married first and we didn't get married until we were 29. So we were a bit late I suppose and started trying straight away then. We had our first miscarriage about six months later. Even now we don't know why they happen, we just keep being told it's bad luck. We started trying and caught straight away but I had a bleed and realised something wasn't right. We went to the hospital and were scanned quite early and had lots of blood tests and realised it had already gone. We were quite devastated the first time, all our friends were getting pregnant so it was quite heartbreaking. Because then you've got to see all your friends starting their families and having exactly what you want but can't have. We left it a couple of months and started trying again but it took us 18 months to get pregnant. We thought everything was fine the second time but at about 11 weeks, just before my three-month scan, I started to bleed. We went to the hospital and they could see that the sack had continued growing but the embryo had stopped growing at about six or seven weeks and there was no heartbeat. We were devastated and went to the doctors at that point and they sent us for some tests. They sent us to a consultant to look into it and he was more concerned that we hadn't got pregnant for 18 months. We had further tests - tests to check my tubes weren't blocked, tests for Andrew - which all came back pretty much clear and after another natural, but unsuccessful pregnancy, they put us on the route of IVF. It takes a few weeks, lots of injections lots of scans, lots of appointments. If anything, you've probably got more time to build your hopes up. When you get that positive pregnancy result and you wait for a scan, there's a couple of weeks of not knowing. But with IVF, at every stage it could go wrong. When they're collecting the eggs there may not be enough there, once they've collected them they might not be mature enough, then when they fertilise them you think \\"are they going to fertilise? Are they going to become embryos?\\" Then you've got to wait a couple of days for them to develop, \\"are they going to make that stage?\\" And then when they finally go back in it's \\"are they going take?\\" At every stage you're on edge, worrying, and then you've got a two-week wait to see if you're actually pregnant and that two weeks is just the worst. I had two rounds of IVF on the NHS, but one wasn't successful and the other resulted in a miscarriage at six or seven weeks - it's always around the same time. We begged and borrowed from family and saved every penny to have one round of IVF that we paid for. It was unsuccessful unfortunately and there were no extra embryos we could use. But we were fortunate that the clinic we used rang us and offered us a free round of treatment if we could fund the medication which was still quite expensive. Of three embryo transfers two were successful, one wasn't. I'm not sure what's worse - getting that positive result and then having a miscarriage or not getting that positive result at all. They're both equally heartbreaking. Finding out I'm pregnant is always slightly happy - having that positive pregnancy test is a lovely feeling but it's quickly followed by \\"oh, let's not get too excited, let's not get our hopes up, let's wait until we get our scans\\". You're secretly hoping everything will be ok, but not letting yourself get too attached to it. Not letting yourself think about setting up a nursery or buying buggies. I like to stay positive because I'm a positive person but also in the back of your mind you're thinking, \\"is it going to be all right this time?\\" There's always that hope but then there's always that niggling thought that it's probably not. You think as long as there's no bleeding or pain it might be ok this time, I might just get through it. But we've been there for each other. Through each time, one of us is strong and the other one can break down a bit. It brings the other one back up again. It has probably brought us closer. I would imagine a lot of people don't get through it because it's so hard. But we've never blamed each other. That's a big thing. You blame yourself but we've never blamed each other. My husband is amazing, he's there through every appointment, holding my hand, sat in the hospital waiting room - just whatever I need. And then there's been times when he's really bad and once I'm on my feet I do the same and pull him up. IVF is around Â£5,000 to Â£6,000 a time which adds to the stress. Especially as my last two pregnancies have been ectopic which resulted in surgery and losing a fallopian tube each time. With the first one I went into hospital thinking I was just having an appointment and within two or three hours I was being operated on which was quite scary. Sometimes they catch it early and they can save the tube but in my case the tube had ruptured which can be life-threatening. I was really lucky, it was keyhole surgery but afterwards you're trying to get over the operation so you're not really thinking about the loss of a child. The second time, the first suggestion when they thought it was ectopic was \\"shall we book you in for surgery and take the other tube?\\" As a woman who's not got any children yet, and still desperately wants them, I felt it was a little insensitive. But I suppose they were looking at what they needed to do. A couple of weeks after one of my ectopic pregnancies I had a phone call asking me if I had made funeral arrangements. I think in the haze of everything going on and needing surgery I must have ticked the box and said I wanted to arrange a funeral. I was quite shocked because it was an eight-week embryo and I didn't really think you could have a funeral for an eight-week embryo. I had to go to the bereavement office in the Heath hospital where I spoke to a lovely lady who told me that if the hospital deal with it there's a memorial service for anyone that's lost a child or lost an early pregnancy. My husband and I went and it was really lovely. I think it just really helped us think \\"yes, we have lost a child\\", it's not just an embryo. We'd lost all those hopes and dreams you have as soon as you get that positive pregnancy test. It's the first time I'd heard of it but it definitely helped. It was just me and my husband and one other couple there. It was only a short a service - about 10 minutes - but it just really helped to mark it. It was the chaplain that did the service and they just talked about your children being up in heaven. It wasn't majorly religious, it was quite comforting. Me and Andrew decided to mark it by going for a little meal, just the two of us, and talking. It was quite a nice thing to do and there's a memorial garden in the crematorium where you can go and lay flowers and spend time if you want as well. Despite all we've been through, we're not giving up yet. I want our baby. I want to look at a child and see my husband looking back up at me. I want that feeling - to feel it growing inside of me and all those things that you go through and at the moment I just can't give up hope for that. I'm sure there will come a time when I might feel differently, my age is against me now, I'm getting older. But at the moment I've got three embryos in storage, I know we won't be able to afford any more rounds of IVF so these three embryos are our last hope. I think that makes us almost put-off doing it because, while they're still there, we've still got hope for the future. That's the safety blanket and once that's gone, it's gone. Then you've got to really change your aspect on how you want to live your life. We might consider adoption, I think we've got a lot to give a child, so it's something we might consider later on but at the moment I can't think about it. I've still got to keep my hope. There's new things happening all the time and hopefully we will find the right thing that will help us and have a bit of good luck for a change. It's hard, but with the support of my husband and my family and my friends, we get through it. We keep focussed; I keep my eye on the prize.

Licensed to serve the community of Pine Ridge , South Dakota , USA , the station is currently owned by Alleycat Communications .  - Community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting. Community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest. They broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local, specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial or mass-media broadcasters. Community radio stations are operated, owned, and influenced by the communities they serve. They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals, groups, and communities to tell their own stories, to share experiences and, in a media-rich world, to become creators and contributors of media.  - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city.  - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.  - Classic rock is a radio format which developed from the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the early 1980s. In the United States, the classic rock format features music ranging generally from the late 1960s to the late 1980s, primarily focusing on commercially successful hard rock popularized in the 1970s. The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s.   - Album-oriented rock (abbreviated AOR) is an American FM radio format focusing on album tracks by rock artists. AOR evolved from progressive rock radio in the mid-1970s, using research and formal programming to create an album rock format with greater commercial appeal.  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - A radio format or programming format (not to be confused with broadcast programming) describes the overall content broadcast on a radio station. Radio formats are frequently employed as a marketing tool, and are subject to frequent change. Music radio, old time radio, all-news radio, sports radio, talk radio and weather radio describe the operation of different genres of radio format and each format can often be sub-divided into many specialty formats.  - Public broadcasting includes radio, television and other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is public service. In much of the world, funding comes from the government, especially via annual fees charged on receivers. In the United States, public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ranging from small shops to corporations, along with audience contributions via pledge drives. The great majority are operated as private not-for-profit corporations.  - The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called radio waves, are extremely widely used in modern technology, particularly in telecommunication. To prevent interference between different users, the generation and transmission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).  - A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services. Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup.  - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the United States government, created by Congressional statute (see and ) to regulate interstate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. The FCC works towards six goals in the areas of broadband, competition, the spectrum, the media, public safety and homeland security, and modernizing itself.  - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world.  - A broadcast license is a type of spectrum license granting the licensee permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes. The licenses generally include restrictions, which vary from band to band.  - Pine Ridge (Lakota: \\"wazíbló\\") is a census-designated place (CDP) and the most populous community in Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 3,308 at the 2010 census. It is the tribal headquarters of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.  - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - The term non-commercial educational (NCE) applies to a radio station or TV station that does not accept on-air advertisements (TV ads or radio ads), as defined in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). NCE stations do not pay broadcast license fees for their non-profit uses of the radio spectrum. Stations which are almost always operated as NCE include public broadcasting, community radio, and college radio, as well as many religious broadcasting stations.  - The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (Wazí Aháha Oyáke in Lakota, also called Pine Ridge Agency) is an Oglala Lakota Native American reservation located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. Originally included within the territory of the Great Sioux Reservation, Pine Ridge was established in 1889 in the southwest corner of South Dakota on the Nebraska border. Today it consists of 3,468.85 sq mi (8,984.306 km) of land area and is the eighth-largest reservation in the United States, larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined.

It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - Yasuhikotakia ( Mekong loaches ) is a genus of botiid loaches , many which are popular aquarium fish . It is named in honor of Japanese collector / researcher Dr. Yasuhiko Taki . This genus has been separated from the genus Botia in the paper by Maurice Kottelat in 2004 . Fishes of the genus Yasuhikotakia are found inhabiting river systems in Indochina such as the Mekong , Chao Phraya , and Mae Klong .  - Botia (Indian loaches) is a genus of freshwater fish in the loach family (Botiidae). It was a large genus with about 20 species. In 2004 Maurice Kottelat proposed in his paper (along with the description of \\"Botia kubotai\\", see References below) to divide the genus into four related genera based on fish appearance and locality:  - Botiidae is a family of cypriniform ray-finned fishes from South, Southeast, and East Asia. Until recently they were placed in the true loach family Cobitidae, until Maurice Kottelat revised the loaches and re-elevated this taxon to family rank in 2012. The family includes about 56 species.  - A vivarium (Latin, literally for \\"place of life\\"; plural: \\"vivaria\\" or \\"vivariums\\") is an area, usually enclosed, for keeping and raising animals or plants for observation or research. Often, a portion of the ecosystem for a particular species is simulated on a smaller scale, with controls for environmental conditions.  - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.  - An aquarium (plural: \\"aquariums\\" or \\"aquaria\\") is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term, coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root \\"aqua\\", meaning water, with the suffix \\"-arium\\", meaning \\"a place for relating to\\". The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, \\"The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea\\" in 1854.  - The Mekong is a trans-boundary river in Southeast Asia. It is the world's 12th-longest river and the 7th-longest in Asia. Its estimated length is , and it drains an area of , discharging of water annually.  - A public aquarium (plural: \\"public aquaria\\" or \\" public aquariums\\") is the aquatic counterpart of a zoo, which houses living aquatic animal and plant specimens for public viewing. Most public aquariums feature tanks larger than those kept by home aquarists, as well as smaller tanks. Since the first public aquariums were built in the mid-19th century, they have become popular and their numbers have increased. Most modern accredited aquariums stress conservation issues and educating the public.  - Maurice Kottelat (born 16 July 1957 in Delémont, Switzerland) is a Swiss ichthyologist specializing in Eurasian freshwater fishes.

News article: Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson has spoken out against Theresa May's plans for Brexit in a newspaper column      Boris Johnson has savaged Theresa May's Brexit plans, saying they would leave the UK with \\"diddly squat\\" after the negotiations and hand the EU \\"victory\\".      The ex-foreign secretary used his Daily Telegraph column to say the Chequers deal \\"means disaster\\" for Britain.      Downing Street hit back, saying his article contained \\"no new ideas\\" and that \\"serious leadership with a serious plan\\" was needed.      It comes after the EU's negotiator criticised the UK's proposals.      The so-called Chequers deal was agreed by cabinet at the prime minister's country residence as the UK's preferred way forward in negotiations with Brussels.      Mrs May's plan would see the UK agreeing a \\"common rulebook\\" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain frictionless trade at the border.      It also officially ends the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, but the ECJ would continue to be \\"the interpreter of EU rules\\" that the UK has agreed to stick to.      Critics say the deal will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March.      The negotiations between the UK and EU have an informal deadline tied to a summit in October - although figures on both sides have said it could slip back to November.      If the UK and the EU do reach a deal, MPs will then have to approve it - and BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described what happens if they reject it as a \\"great unknown\\".      \\"Nobody can answer that question because it simply has not happened before,\\" she added.      In his first intervention on the EU debate since quitting the government, Mr Johnson compared negotiations between Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Mr Barnier to a wrestling match.      He wrote: \\"The whole thing is about as pre-ordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy; and in this case, I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head.\\"      Mr Johnson said negotiations based on the Chequers plan had so far seen the EU take \\"every important trick\\", adding: \\"The UK has agreed to hand over £40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat.\\"      Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search      He said by using the strategy - defended by Mrs May in the Sunday Telegraph over the weekend - the UK had \\"gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank\\".      If it continued on the same path, Mr Johnson added, the government would \\"throw away most of the advantages of Brexit\\".      Mr Johnson also accused some members of the government of using the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to \\"stop a proper Brexit\\", but added: \\"They have been rumbled.\\"      The \\"scandal\\" around the border problem was \\"not that we have failed, but that we have not even tried\\", he added.      Mr Johnson argued that a hard border would not be needed after Brexit - because people did not need to be checked due to the Common Travel Area and that any checks on goods could be done away from the border.      In response, Mrs May's official spokesman said: \\"Boris Johnson resigned over Chequers. There's no new ideas in this article to respond to.      \\"What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that's exactly what the country has with this prime minister and this Brexit plan.      \\"She is a serious prime minister and she has put forward serious proposals.\\"      Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: \\"Typical Johnson. False promises. Then refusal to take responsibility for his own actions. It's always someone else's fault.\\"      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting at Chequers in July      Meanwhile, in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised the Chequers deal, saying to agree to it would see \\"the end of the single market and the European project\\".      He said plans for a \\"common rulebook\\" for goods but not services were not in the EU's interests, adding: \\"Our own ecosystem has grown over decades. You cannot play with it by picking pieces.\\"      \\"The British have a choice,\\" he said. \\"They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice.      \\"But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences.      \\"Then all sorts of other third[-party] countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits.\\"      Image copyright EPA Image caption Michel Barnier has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan      Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, one of Mrs May's allies, former First Secretary of State Damian Green, said it would be \\"difficult but not impossible\\" for the Chequers plan to win the support of MPs in the House of Commons.      He said it was \\"absolutely certain\\" there was no Parliamentary majority for a so-called \\"hard Brexit\\" and challenged supporters of that option to come up with a proposal that could win the support of the House of Commons.      Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan, told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mrs May should not be replaced, because \\"we don't need any more turbulence right now\\".      \\"What matters in all of this is not the personality politics, it's the outcome at the end,\\" he added.      Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said of Chequers: \\"This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that.      \\"Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU.\\"      On Sunday, Mrs May wrote that she was \\"confident\\" a \\"good deal\\" could be reached on Brexit.      But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create \\"real challenges for both the UK and the EU\\" in some sectors. ||||| FILE - In this Thursday, May 25, 2017 file photo British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, left, and Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrive for a meeting during the NATO summit of heads of state and...

Johnson wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Monday that May's so-called Chequers plan for continued ties with the European Union after Brexit will leave Britain in a weakened position.      He said that May is giving EU leaders a \\"victory\\" without even trying to forge a Brexit plan that would strengthen Britain's hand after it leaves the EU in March.

Theresa May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that it would be a \\"gross betrayal of our democracy\\" to have another vote.      She said \\"millions came out to have their say\\" in the June 2016 vote that set Brexit in motion.      Her embattled government has faced increasingly strident calls for another vote once the terms of Britain's future relations with the EU are known.      The prime minister used the column to defend her \\"Chequers proposal\\" that would maintain some ties with the EU, and said she won't be pushed around by EU negotiators.

Question: What is the name of the person who was one of five artists shortlisted by the Australian Government for a project to produce a public artwork celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Biographer Hannah Fink estimated that Oliver produced 290 works over a career of 22 years. Of these, public art works are Oliver's best known sculptures. These include Eyrie, created for Adelaide's Hyatt Hotel in 1993, and Magnolia and Palm, commissioned in 1999 by the Sydney Botanical Gardens, as part of the Sydney Sculpture Walk. That same year, Big Feathers was commissioned for the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane. It comprises two large feather-shaped forms suspended above the pedestrian precinct, representing \\"Queen Street's history of parades as well as the mall's connection between earth and sky\\".In 2000, Oliver's piece Entwine was a finalist in the inaugural Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award, while in the following year, Oliver won the University of New South Wales inaugural sculpture commission competition, with her three-metre-high Globe. Other success followed, when Trace was selected for the National Gallery of Australia's 2002 National Sculpture Prize exhibition.In August 2002 she was one of five artists shortlisted by the Australian Government for a project to produce a public artwork celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia.By the 2000s most of Oliver's output constituted commissioned pieces, whether public or private. The most substantial of these is Vine, a 16.5 metre high sculpture installed as part of the 400 million refurbishment of the Sydney Hilton. Taking twelve months to create and requiring a budget of up to half million dollars, the work was completed in 2005. The sculpture was fabricated from 380 kilograms of aluminium, and assembled by a team of eight Croatian welders.By 2006, Oliver had held 18 solo exhibitions of her work, half of them at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, which represented her throughout her career as a sculptor. Only one of those solo exhibitions was held outside Australia: a 1992 exhibition at Auckland City Gallery. However, Oliver was represented in numerous international group shows, including five during the period 1983 to 1984, around the time... Answer:","output":"The name of the person who was one of five artists shortlisted by the Australian Government for a project to produce a public artwork celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia is Bronwyn Oliver. Bronwyn Oliver was an accomplished sculptor, with an extensive body of work. Throughout her career, she created numerous public art pieces, including Eyrie, Magnolia and Palm, Big Feathers, Entwine, Globe, Trace, and Vine. She was widely recognized for her artistic contributions and was selected for numerous awards, exhibitions, and competitions, both nationally and internationally. The fact that she was shortlisted for the Australian Government's project to produce a public artwork honoring women's suffrage speaks to her significant standing within the Australian art community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Ontario election: 5 key questions after Liberals win majority Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne scored a surprise majority win in last night's Ontario election. Here are five key questions to consider as voters and pundits sift through the results. Leader Tim Hudak is out as leader after two failed bids to steer his party to power at Queen's Park. Voters rejected Hudak's plan for deep spending cuts to spur job growth and quickly clear the deficit. But who will pick up the Tory torch in a now depleted caucus that offers no clear choice for a successor? A list of five possible candidates is listed here. The answer will likely be more about what kind of conservative alternative the PCs want to offer. Horwath's decision to withold support for the Liberal budget triggered this 93-million snap election. In the next few weeks, she'll be left to answer why this was done when the result was a Liberal majority and an NDP seat count that stays static at 21. Horwath wakes up Friday as the leader of a party leader whose views the Liberals no longer have to listen to. Horwath was seen as the strongest of the three party leaders after the 2011 election. This time, she was somewhat hand-tied by her decision to reject a Liberal budget that many progressives liked. It will be interesting to see whether her party chooses to punish Horwath for her failed gambit and push for a new leader, or continue to support a leader who is — despite Thursday's results — a seasoned campaigner. NDP MPP Jagmeet Singh, who was re-elected in Bramalea-Gore-Malton, told CBC's Metro Morning on Friday the caucus stands by her decision to trigger the election. We'll see. After less than a year as an MPP, Doug Holyday, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's former deputy mayor, was ousted in the west Toronto riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. Toronto conservatives were high-fiving each other when Holyday took the riding from the Liberals in a 2013 byelection. That win gave the PCs their first foothold in the GTA, with thoughts of a full onslaught in Toronto ridings to come. Now Etobicoke-Lakeshore is Liberal red again under Holyday's former council colleague, Peter Milczyn, and the Tories were shut out of vote-rich downtown Toronto. Holyday supported Ford's fiscal agenda, then decried the mayor's antics as the crack scandal took hold last year. Ford is expected to emerge from rehab later this month and resume his bid for re-election in October. The PCs' poor showing across the GTA may not bode well for Toronto's controversial mayor or federal Conservatives seeking re-election in Toronto. All over the place is the only way to describe what pollsters were saying ahead of this election. Almost no one was predicting a majority by any party, much less the Liberals. The polls also failed to predict results in recent B.C. and Alberta elections. It may be time for professional pollsters to re-evaluate how they gauge voter intentions. Wynne did not have a strong performance in the televised debate of the main party leaders that most pundits felt Hudak won. She spent too much time on the defensive for the gas plant decision made by predecessor Dalton McGuinty. She rarely looked her opponents in the eye and many were distracted by her sharp, frequent hand gestures. In the end, though, the performances were not decisive, leaving some to wonder if debates are given too much weight. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne scored a surprise majority win in the Ontario election. 2. Tim Hudak, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, is out after two failed bids to steer the party to power at Queen's Park. The party now seeks a successor with no clear choice. 3. New Democratic Party Leader Andrea Horwath faces questions about her decision to withhold support for the Liberal budget, which triggered a 93-million snap election that resulted in a Liberal majority. 4. Doug Holyday, former Deputy Mayor of Toronto and MPP, was ousted in the Etobicoke-Lakeshore riding, indicating a poor showing for the Progressive Conservative Party in the Greater Toronto Area. 5. Pollsters had difficulty predicting the outcome of the election, with most not expecting a majority win by any party, raising the question of whether their methods need re-evaluation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Good fortune has caused a lack of focus preserving history.\\"?","output":"To determine whether the premise \\"Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation\\" entails the hypothesis \\"Good fortune has caused a lack of focus on preserving history,\\" I will analyze the two statements step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that prosperity, or economic and financial success, has led to a new emphasis on preserving history. This means that when people or societies have more resources, they focus more on protecting and maintaining historical sites, artifacts, and traditions. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that good fortune, or success and happiness, has caused a lack of focus on preserving history. This is contradictory to the premise, as it asserts that success has led to less attention being paid to historical preservation. Step 3: Check whether the premise entails the hypothesis For a premise to entail a hypothesis, it must imply that the hypothesis will also be true if the premise is true. However, the premise and the hypothesis hold contradicting positions regarding the effect of prosperity on historical preservation. The premise states that prosperity leads to more emphasis on historic preservation while the hypothesis claims that good fortune results in a lack of focus on preserving history. Based on this contradiction, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Conclusion: If the premise \\"Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation\\" is true, it tells us that it does not entail the hypothesis \\"Good fortune has caused a lack of focus on preserving history\\" due to their contradicting positions on the relationship between prosperity or good fortune and the emphasis on historical preservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The RQ-4A Global Hawk drone crashed during a routine training flight from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, according to Jamie Cosgrove, a spokeswoman for the Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons Program at the base. There were no injuries to civilians and no property damage, said the Navy, which said it is investigating the cause. Video from CNN affiliate WBOC showed smoke rising from brush fires in the unpopulated area. The drone crashed into a tributary of the Nanticoke River, a U.S. Coast Guard official said. The crash site has been blocked to recreational boat traffic while the agency investigates, the Coast Guard official said. As soon as Navy personnel lost contact with the unmanned vehicle, a piloted aircraft was dispatched to Maryland's Eastern Shore, where it came upon the wreckage and determined that it was unlikely anyone on the ground had been hurt, Navy officials told CNN. The crash occurred at about 12:11 p.m., near Bloodworth Island in Dorchester County, the Navy said. The aircraft is one of five aircraft acquired from the Air Force Global Hawk program. The BAMS-D program has been developing tactics and doctrine for the employment of high-altitude unmanned patrol aircraft since November 2006. The drone can fly for 30 hours without refueling at altitudes as high as 11 miles. It is typically used for reconnaissance. Of the five drones based at southern Maryland's Naval Air Station Patuxent River, four are in routine training and one is deployed with the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet, the officials said. The basic RQ-4A Global Hawk UAV, manufactured for the U.S. Air Force by Northrop-Grumman, is the largest and most advanced drone in the U.S. military, according to the Navy.

On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

If it isn't, then it cannot be prime. In this case, it is greater than 1. Step 2: Since the number is greater than 1, I will start checking if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. I will do this by iterating through a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of n, which is approximately (sqrt(24631) ≈ 157). This is because if a number has a factor larger than its square root, it must also have a smaller factor. Step 3: I will now check each of the potential factors to see if any of them can evenly divide 'n' (without leaving a remainder). To do this, I will use the modulus operator, which returns the remainder when 'n' is divided by each potential factor. Step 4: For each number within the range (2 to 157), if I find a number that leaves a remainder of 0 when using the modulus operator with 24631, it means 24631 is divisible by that number and is therefore not prime.

You are presented with the question \\"What content increases melting points of solids?\\" and the following answer choices:  - salt  - Joules  - water  - fats  - heat  - glass  - sugar  - coal  Now knowing that adding salt to a solid decreases the freezing point of that solid and water density decreases with temperature and increases with salt content, choose the best answer. A:","output":"The question at hand is \\"What content increases melting points of solids?\\" From the given answer choices, we have - salt, Joules, water, fats, heat, glass, sugar, and coal. To find the best answer, let's discuss each option individually and understand its implications on the melting points of solids. 1. Salt: When salt is added to a solid (particularly to ice), it disrupts the stable crystal lattice structure and decreases the freezing point of the solid, not increasing the melting point as the question asks. So, salt is not the correct answer. 2. Joules: Joules are a unit of energy, not a content-type that can be added to a solid to affect its melting point. Therefore, Joules cannot be the correct answer. 3. Water: Adding water to a solid generally doesn't increase the melting point of the solid. When the solid is ice, adding water would dilute the ice fraction and can lower the freezing point under specific conditions. So, water is not the correct answer. 4. Fats: Fats generally have lower melting points as compared to other molecules like salts and sugars. They don't affect the melting point of other solids in a way that would lead to increased melting points. Thus, fats are not the correct answer. 5. Heat: Although heat is critical in the process of melting a solid, it itself is not a content that can be added to solids to increase their melting points. Heat only facilitates the transition from solid to liquid by providing the required energy. 6. Glass: Glass is an amorphous solid, and it does not chemically interact with other solids in a way that might cause an increase in their melting points. Therefore, glass is not the correct answer. 7. Sugar: Adding sugar to a solid can increase the melting point of the mixture. When sugar is mixed with a solid, it forms hydrogen bonds with the molecules of the solid, making the lattice structure more stable and thus requiring more energy (higher temperature) to break those bonds and melt the mixture. Consequently, sugar is the best answer among the options. 8. Coal: Coal is a carbonaceous material that does not interact with other solids to increase their melting points. If anything, heating coal to high temperatures would turn it into gas, and it would not increase the melting point of other solids. In conclusion, out of the given answer choices, sugar is the best answer for the content that increases the melting points of solids. This is primarily because sugar forms hydrogen bonds with the molecules of the solid, resulting in a more stable lattice structure, and requiring more energy (higher temperature) to break those bonds and cause melting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before Jason could move in as a tenant to Dennis's apartment complex,","output":"Before Jason could move in as a tenant to Dennis's apartment complex, there were several important steps and requirements he needed to accomplish and adhere to in order to ensure a smooth transition into his new living space.  First and foremost, Jason needed to fill out a rental application form, which would provide Dennis with all the necessary information about him, his rental history, employment, and income. This is a crucial step for any landlord-tenant relationship, as it allows both parties to gauge each other's ability to maintain a mutually beneficial agreement.  After submitting his application, Jason would then need to go through a thorough background and credit check, allowing Dennis the apartment complex owner to ensure that he is a responsible and reliable tenant. This process guarantees that Jason has a clean record and steady income, ensuring that he is capable of maintaining the monthly rent payments and contributing to a safe and harmonious environment with other tenants within the complex. Once the screening process was completed and found satisfactory, Jason would need to read and sign a lease agreement. The lease agreement is a legally binding document that outlines the terms and conditions of the rental, such as the duration of the lease, rent amount, payment due dates, security deposit details, and the rights and responsibilities of both the landlord and tenant. By signing the lease, Jason would be committing to comply with all the terms and conditions stated therein. In addition to the lease agreement, Jason might also need to review and agree to a set of house rules established by Dennis for the entire apartment complex. These rules may include things like quiet hours, garbage disposal protocol, pet policies, and common area maintenance, among others. Adhering to these rules ensures a peaceful and harmonious living environment not only for Jason but also for other tenants within the apartment complex. Once all the necessary paperwork has been completed and submitted, Jason would be required to provide a security deposit. This deposit is intended to cover any potential damages to the rented unit, and it is usually equivalent to one month's rent. This deposit would be held by Dennis and could be returned to Jason at the end of his lease, provided there are no damages or outstanding payments. After securing the unit with a deposit and completing all required documentation, Dennis would then need to prepare the unit for Jason's move-in. This may involve conducting a walk-through inspection of the unit with Jason, noting any existing signs of wear and tear or damages. Both parties would sign off on this inspection report, agreeing to the current condition of the unit. This document becomes significant when determining whether any damages incurred during Jason's tenancy would be deducted from his security deposit at the end of his lease. Finally, once all these steps have been carried out, and both Jason and Dennis are satisfied with the arrangements, Jason would be given the keys to his new home at the apartment complex. He would then proceed to move in and start a new chapter of his life as a tenant at Dennis's apartment complex. Both parties would be expected to maintain open lines of communication and uphold their respective responsibilities, ensuring a lasting and successful landlord-tenant relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen.  Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\".  Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen.  But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside.  Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint.  When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground.  Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline.  Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again.  However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald.  When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\"  The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete.

Given the following context:  Just-married taxi driver Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning is led to an abandoned bomb-site by an eight-year-old girl who says that she has lost her dog. The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case. She later wins the sympathy of the junior counsel Peter Tanner, who visits Manning in prison, believes in his protestation of innocence and makes the case his own. The trial begins at London's Old Bailey, where Tanner is opposed by his father, prosecuting counsel Geoffrey Tanner. The trial is presided over by Justice Harrington, whose wife is in the hospital undergoing a serious operation. It soon becomes evident that things are going badly for Manning. Jurors are seen expressing their belief in Manning's guilt even before the trial was over. Irene's mother gave hearsay evidence that Manning had given the victim sweets, breaking down in tears and accusing Manning of murder. Following the testimony of prosecution-witness Horace Clifford, all of the evidence seems to point to Manning's guilt.  answer the following question:  Who observes the girl running from the taxi driver?

During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"To answer the question \\"Which happened more recently the Paleocene or the Cretaceous Period?\\", I will compare the time periods of both events.

Please answer the following question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Question: Who is the hairdresser?

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump. Seriously.” I really don’t know if this is the most “cheapskate” thing, on just CRAZY fiscal responsibility.

They use a type of chemical for your heels to slough off dead skin instead of a razor (this remover cost 3, but is well worth it). Then they do a nice calf and foot massage at the end. I also noticed that they did gel nails, so I decided I would come back for those the next week.  And so I did...I walked in and asked for pink and white gels. They were oh so happy to oblige. I sat down and the girl immediately got to work. She started the sanding down of the nail and applied the white tips...and this is when it started to go down hill. The girl was distracted and said she had to do something in the back, but would be back in a moment. So I said okay...no biggie. I can wait a minute. The guy sitting next to her said he would finish for her (which is a good thing, because she didn't come back for about 20 minutes). So I moved over and he started his work. Everything was going as normal...until he started to apply the \\"gel.\\" The \\"gel\\" came in powder form. Hmmm...gel...in powder form? How does that even make sense? OH, yeah...that would be because it isn't gel. It's acrylic and they use a gel topcoat/nail polish on top. Yet, they charge you more. It's a total scam. Regardless, I was leaving town the next day and just let them do their thing. After I paid and left I really started looking at my nails...and they were CROOKED! Not only was the filing off (completely lopsided on a few nails - luckily that can be remedied with a nail file), but so were a couple of the tips! When she put them on, she didn't even check to make sure they were straight! To make matters worse, these nails yellowed! That can happen when a cheap acrylic is used and is exposed to any type of UV light, aka tanning beds...or if you spend an excessive amount of time outside. I thought maybe it was just the surface that yellowed, but when I got them taken off today (in favor of REAL gel nails at another salon) I noticed they were yellowed all the way through! IF it's yellow all the way through, it's most likely that you have cheap or even toxic MMA Acrylic on your nails!!   Needless to say, while their pedicures are nice...I will not be frequenting this place again...ESPECIALLY for nails.... 1. negative 2. positive I think the answer is","output":"1. negative This review is considered negative because the person who wrote it had a bad experience at the salon. The pedicure was good but the nail service was not as expected. The problem was that they were told they were getting gel nails, but it was actually acrylic. They were charged more for this. Also, the application was messy - the nails were crooked and eventually turned yellow. This reviewer won't go back there for nails again. For a simple way to understand, imagine if you get an ice cream, but instead you've been given a vegetable you don't like and you also have to pay more for it, you wouldn't be happy, right? That's the same reason this review is negative. The second option, positive, is not correct, because positive would mean that the person liked the service, which opposite to what happened. In our ice cream example, it would be like you got an ice cream you love and you're happy and satisfied."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Invented in Turkey and patented by Nanopool, a German company, the spray-on liquid glass might become one of the most useful inventions in the field of nanotechnology. The product was tested at the Saarbrucken Institute for New Materials.  It is worth mentioning that the invention is transparent and non-poisonous. The liquid glass can protect any type of surface from damages caused by water, UV radiation, dirt, heat, and bacterial infections. Besides, it is flexible and breathable, which means that the liquid glass can be applied on plants and seeds as well. Researchers found that the spray greatly increases the resistance of plants to bacteria-caused diseases. The trials also showed that the sprayed seeds grew faster.  Depending on the type of surface that is to be covered, researchers can add water or ethanol to the spray. Scientists say that  _ . The spray produces a coating that is just 100nm thick. Trials by food processing plants in Germany have concluded that foods covered with the glass can store longer than those stored in normal condition. According to Neil McClelland, UK project manager with Nanopool, due to its capabilities, the spray-on liquid glass can become one of the most useful inventions around the world, ending up being used by a lot of industries that will cover their products. At present, the invention is being used by a train company and a hotel chain in the UK, as well as a hamburger chain in Germany that are carrying out tests of the liquid glass for various uses.  The spray-on liquid glass was also tested in a Lancashire hospital, where it showed \\"very promising\\" results, being used to cover medical equipment and bandages. The invention could be also used on clothing, because it cannot be seen by the naked eye, thus clothes could become stain resistant. Due to its unique characteristics, the liquid glass can be used to cover bathrooms, sinks and many other surfaces in the home. According to the researchers, the spay-on glass can last for a year. It is expected to hit the DIY stores... Question: Which of the following about the liquid glass is NOTtrue? Options: A: We can still see an object clearly covered with the liquid.

Article:But they are not movie stars or supermodels: they are Hong Kong's A-list \\"tutor kings\\" and \\"tutor queens\\", offering pupils a chance to improve mediocre grades. In Hong Kong's consumer culture, looks sell. Celebrity tutors in their sophisticated hair-dos and designer trappings are treated like idols by their young fans who flock to their classes. And they have earnings to match - some have become millionaires and appear regularly on television shows. \\"If you want to be a top tutor, it definitely helps if you are young and attractive. Students look at your appearance,\\" said Kelly Mok, 26, a \\"tutor queen\\" at King's Glory, one of Hong Kong's largest tutorial establishments. Her designer clothes and accessories are not just for the billboards; it's how she likes to dress outside classes. But she is also careful to add that she wouldn't be in such high demand if she could not deliver top grades in her subject, English. Richard Eng from Beacon College is often credited with being the first of Hong Kong's \\"star tutors\\". A former secondary school teacher, he says he got the idea after he featured in photographs advertising his sister, a performance artist. \\"In school all the teachers look the same, there's no excitement,\\" he said. His own image appears on special ring-binders and folders containing study tips, or pens which harbour a pull-out scroll with his picture and other gifts. Such items became so sought after that they propelled him to near-rock star status among young people. The celebrity tutor phenomenon is a result of the huge growth in out-of-school tutoring in Asia. It is fuelled by highly pressured examination systems and ambitious parents wanting their children to secure places at top universities and high-status secondary schools. In societies where success is equated with good exam results, parental anxiety converts into a \\"steady stream of revenue\\" for tutoring establishments, according to a study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The tutoring industry, or \\"shadow education\\" as the ADB calls it, has become very widespread in Asia, fed by the growth in universities and the rising proportion of school leavers aiming for university. Hong Kong University's professor Mark Bray, one of the authors of the ADB study, said a staggering 72% of final-year school students in Hong Kong now go to private tutors. Richer families have always paid for individual tutoring, but the star tutors offer exam tips and revision notes to the less well-off,  studying in groups of over 100. It's not just Hong Kong. Tutoring has \\"spread and intensified in Asia and become more commercialised,\\" said professor Bray. In South Korea, 90% of primary school children attend such classes. In South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India, tutorial schools use star tutors to attract even more students. \\"They have found a way to appeal to young people and pull them in. They create a buzz,\\" he said. \\"We had this phenomenon of star tutors in Kota as well,\\" said Pramod Maheshwari, chief executive of Career Point Coaching School in Kota, Rajasthan, India, a city of residential tutorial colleges which attract students from all over the country. \\"It can give you an edge.\\" But ultimately, he says, expansion of tutoring is driven not by personalities but by \\"the inefficiency of the school system\\". \\"Across India, students' education level is not up to the mark, and millions are preparing for competitive college examinations. It is a huge market,\\" said Mr Maheshwari. In China, where private tutorial schools were unknown until the economy opened up in the 1990s, New Oriental Education and Technology has grown to become one of the largest tutoring schools in Asia with around 2.4 million students this year. It boasts 17,600 teachers in 49 cities and an online network of over 7.8 million users. Listed on the New York stock exchange since 2006, its founder Michael Yu (also known as Yu Minhong), became a multi-millionaire on the back of his blend of rote learning exercises, stand-up comedy and motivational speeches. A man from a humble background, who had become an English teacher at Peking University, Mr Yu used the Hong Kong model of employing star tutors to prepare students for tests for universities abroad. Extensive tutoring is sometimes seen as contributing to East Asian countries' high performance in international school comparisons, particularly in mathematics. But professor Bray points out that the high performers in the international Pisa tests (Programme for International Student Assessment) also include countries that do not use much tutoring, such as in Scandinavia. There have also been attempts to reduce the impact of tuition. In the 1980s, the South Korean government issued a blanket prohibition on such private tutoring. It proved to be unenforceable, but it reflected worries that tuition can put too much pressure on pupils, with teachers complaining that pupils were falling asleep in class after long nights of tutoring. In 2009, the South Korean government adopted measures to limit the number of hours students spent in \\"hagwons\\" or tutorial centres in a bid to reduce childhood stress and increase the level of creative thinking. But the impact has been limited, pushing many tutorial classes online. The government has since realised that the only way to change is to alter the exam culture, reducing the number of university entrance exams and encouraging universities to consider applicants on more than just exam scores. A Singaporean study showed that while tutoring can have a positive influence on the subject being tutored, time taken away from other subjects may lead to a decline in overall academic performance. The ADB report says in all parts of Asia, families are spending a considerable amount of the household income on tutoring. It may contribute to improved achievement for individual students, but it can exacerbate social inequalities. Although there is some evidence of a cultural propensity to pay for tutoring - cities such as Vancouver in Canada and Sydney in Australia with large Chinese communities have a lot of tutoring - this is not the only factor. \\"What happens in tutoring depends on what the schools and universities ask for. The parents will respond to whatever they think will get them in,\\" said professor Bray. Hong Kong recently shifted from a system similar to GCSEs and A-levels used in the UK to a single examination taken at age 17, leading to an explosion in tutoring. \\"There is greater pressure on students because there is only one examination that determines whether you get into university,\\" said Kelly Mok. \\"With so many tutors in Hong Kong, students don't know who to choose so they go for the 'tutor kings' and 'tutor queens',\\" she said. Some students just attend the lectures and watch video recordings of lectures while others purchase add-ons such as personalised interaction with the star tutor or tutor's aide via Facebook or email. But as more students enrol, it can become increasingly difficult to keep up with examination tips learned by classmates. \\"Students who would not otherwise have had tutoring may now do so in order not to be at a competitive disadvantage,\\" says professor Bray. But Richard Eng denies that tutors are sowing panic. \\"Panic comes from the exams themselves. If there was no examination in Hong Kong, no matter what I say or look like, they would not come to me.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"In Hong Kong, \\"tutor kings\\" and \\"tutor queens\\" have emerged as young, attractive private tutors with celebrity-like status who teach subjects such as English and math to help students improve their grades. These celebrity tutors have massive followings and often earn millions of dollars due to their popularity and high demand. The celebrity tutor phenomenon has been fueled by Asia's highly competitive examination systems and increasingly ambitious parents who have hopes for their children to secure spots at top universities and prestigious secondary schools. In Hong Kong, for instance, it has been reported that about 72% of final-year school students attend private tutoring sessions to improve their grades. While wealthier families can afford individual tutoring for their children, others turn to these well-known tutors for exam tips and large group classes. These tutors have been successful in creating a buzz and attracting young students by offering a more dynamic and engaging experience than schools, which have been criticized for being inefficient and less exciting. The tutoring industry, or \\"shadow education\\" as it is referred to by the Asian Development Bank, has grown rapidly across Asia due to the increase in access to higher education and job opportunities requiring university degrees. Tutoring schools in countries such as South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India have also started using celebrity tutors to attract more students. While some may attribute East Asian countries' high performance in international school comparisons to the impact of extensive tutoring, there are also concerns that this aggressive tutoring culture can exacerbate social inequalities and negatively affect overall academic performance. South Korea has even attempted to limit the number of hours students spend in tutorial centers in an effort to reduce childhood stress and foster more creative thinking. Still, it seems that the celebrity tutor phenomenon will continue to have a strong presence in Asia as long as students and parents perceive them as the key to academic success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As a result, the respiratory rate (breathing rate) slows down, and there's a reduction in overall oxygen consumption. This effect can be considered an indirect effect on the process of oxygen absorption. Although the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen is not directly affected by resting or sleeping, the body's oxygen requirement decreases, leading to a reduced demand for oxygen absorption by the lungs."},{"instruction":"Q:I have a new situation: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.

The grown-ups believe that they need to work really hard on it and pay a lot of attention to it because it's so important. That's why they say \\"all our efforts and attention\\" (in German, \\"all unsere Anstrengungen und Aufmerksamkeit\\"). And when they believe something is worth all that work, they say it \\"deserves\\" it (in German, \\"verdient\\"). So the whole sentence in German says this important thing needs lots of hard work and attention from everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Stephen Larkham (born 29 May 1974 in Canberra) is a retired Australian rugby union footballer currently in the role of attack coach for the Australian Rugby Union side, the Wallabies. He is best known for his career with the Brumbies in Super Rugby, for whom he played from the inception of the professional Super 12 in 1996 through 2007, and his long tenure with the Wallabies at international level, for whom he played 102 times. After initial selection at fullback from 1996 to 1997, Larkham was the first-choice Australian fly-half from 1997 to 2007, playing in the 1999, 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups. He is married to Jacqueline and has two children, Jaimee and Tiahna. Larkham was an important part of the Australian 2003 World Cup squad which lost in the tournament final to England. He has suffered greatly from injuries through his career, especially to his knees and right elbow. Despite these he remained a competent defender in spite of his relatively light frame. He was also tried at inside centre by John Connolly for one test against Wales 2006 but the experiment was not regarded a success and he never played there again.  He was famous for forming a long-standing half-back partnership with George Gregan, both of whom were foundation players with the ACT Brumbies rugby franchise. When both retired after the 2007 World Cup, not only were they the two most-capped Wallabies, but they played in more Tests than any other scrum-half/fly-half combination in history, with 79 appearances together. So important were they to the team that in 2007 at Bruce Stadium (Canberra Stadium), a new stand was unveiled as the \\"Gregan-Larkham Stand\\" in honour of both players and their combination to the team.  He played his last test against Japan in the 2007 World Cup before a knee injury sidelined him, which effectively ended his Test career as Australia were then knocked out of the competition before he could return.  On 14 May 2007, despite larger offers from French and English teams, Larkham signed a contract with Edinburgh Rugby in Scotland to join them after the 2007 World Cup; however; this deal subsequently fell through, reportedly because the Scottish Rugby Union would not fund the deal. Newly promoted Leeds expressed an interest, as did the Welsh side, the Dragons. However, in January 2008 it was announced that he will join Ricoh Black Rams of Japan.  Larkham played for the ACT Veterans Rugby Club at the World Vintage Rugby Carnival in Hawaii in September 2012. During this carnival he also played as a reserve for an old boys team from Brazil who, not realising who he was, asked him to play second row because he was tall. Despite his other commitments, Larkham occasionally still plays with the ACT Veterans to help them raise funds for the charities they support. On 18 February 2018, he received the GENLEC Player of the Day jacket for his great play and sportsmanship in the Clare Holland Cup charity match. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he participate in any World Cups in his later career?","output":"Yes, Stephen Larkham participated in World Cups in his later career.

Input: Context: The mechanism of L-DOPA for antinociception was investigated. Nociceptive behaviors in mice after an intrathecal (i.t.) administration of substance P were evaluated. L-DOPA (i.t.) dose-dependently attenuated the substance P-induced nociceptive behaviors. Co-administration of benserazide (i.t.), a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, abolished the antinociceptive effect of L-DOPA. The L-DOPA-induced antinociception was antagonized by sulpiride, a D2 blocker, but not by SCH 23390, a D1 blocker. These results suggest that L-DOPA relieves pain after conversion to dopamine, with the dopamine sedating pain transmission by way of the dopamine D2 receptor.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Students can learn a lot from actively participating in class. One way that you can encourage participation is by having constructive class discussions. Ask open-ended questions so that students have to give more than a yes or no answer. Don't ask questions with a set answer in mind. Discussions should help students explore different ideas.  Younger kids can start to learn critical thinking by answering questions. You could try, \\"What are some ways to show kindness?\\" You'll get lots of different answers! For example, you could ask, “Why is it so important that we take steps to protect the environment?” You could also try, “Do you think the U.S. should get involved in trying to solve problems in other countries? Why or why not?” In addition to discussion, you can try lots of other ways to help students get involved in class. Anything that gets the students doing something new for a few minutes is good. You can easily adjust activities according to the subject you teach. For almost any subject, you could try short in-class writing assignments. This will give students a break from listening to you talk and give them some time to learn more actively.  Say, “Okay, everyone spend 5 minutes writing about what you think the key points of today's topic. When you're done, we'll share our thoughts as a large group.”   Ask students to relate the topic to their own lives. For example, “Write a paragraph about what kinds of things your family does to help the environment.” Try Stand Up Sit Down. For example, if you are trying to teach the difference between proper nouns and common nouns, you can have students stand up if the word you say is a proper noun and sit down if it is a common noun. You can apply this to many subjects, including math. Try having students stand up if a number is prime and sit down if it is not. Working together can help students see material in a new way. It can also make things more fun! In addition to assigning group projects, you can find other creative ways to help students interact with one another.  Try Think-Pair-Share. Give students a question, and give them a few minutes to think about their answer. Then, have them pair up and share their answers with each other. Finally, have each pair share their answers with the whole class. This works great with high school and college students. Play a matching game. Hand out a note card with a word or phrase on it and have students get up and find their match. You can do this with rhyming words, synonyms, problems/solutions, or anything that you want! Elementary school kids can have lots of fun with this one. Getting out of the classroom is a great way to help students connect to material! Field trips are a great way to bring some excitement to the topic you're teaching. Make sure that the field trip clearly relates to what you are teaching. For example, if you've been learning about environmental issues, take students to a self-sustaining farm.  If you've been teaching about the solar system, take a trip to a planetarium. Make sure to follow all school policies when you're planning a field trip. For high school and college students, constructive debates are a great way for students to connect with the material. During discussions, encourage students to share opposing viewpoints. For example, if you are talking about whether or not peaceful protests are constructive, have students clearly explain their viewpoints. Make sure that students remain civil. No name calling, raised voices, or insults! If things start to get heated, wrap up the debate. Say, \\"We obviously have lots of strong feelings on this. To wrap up, take 5 minutes to write down what you feel are the key points on this issue.\\" Summary:","output":"This article talks about the importance of students participating in class and suggests various fun activities and discussions to help them learn better and connect with the subject matter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital, is the government the best actor to solve this issue?

You haven't practiced your clarinet at all ... for an entire month, so you have to catch up on that. And, don't you have an essay due in your English class on Tuesday?  Daughter: Oh, I forgot about that [Yeah], and anyway, I was going to finish that during first period at school. [Great. I've never heard of a three-sentence essay.] So, what about Tuesday?  Father: Uh, you have soccer practice from 4:00 until 5:30, and after that, you have to do your homework.  Daughter: Ah, you can help me with that. Oh, I forgot you don't know how to do geometry. So, can I see the movie on Thursday?  Father: Well, remember the science fair at school is on Friday, right? Is, is your project finished yet?  Daughter: Umm, what about Friday night? I checked the paper, and there's a midnight showing.  Father: Uh-uh. Forget that idea.  Daughter: And Saturday?  Father: Well, you have to do your chores in the morning before noon. [You can help me with that.] Oh no. And then, we have to clean out the garage. You said you'd help. [No, you volunteered me.] Well, that should only take a couple of hours. [Dad, you're ruining my social life.] And then, after that, we can go to the movie.  Daughter: We?  Father: Yeah, We. Mom and I and you and Shannon.  Daughter: Uh, Dad, actually. We weren't planning on company.  Father: Now, let me check the paper for showtimes. [The movie plays at three oh five, five, seven fifteen, and nine.] You already checked, I see.  Daughter: Yeah.

Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his... Answer:","output":"Etty"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. The man could write instructions for building engines but not houses, since","output":"his expertise lay primarily in the domain of mechanical engineering. As a renowned mechanical engineer, he had spent a significant portion of his life studying, designing, and constructing various types of engines – from internal combustion engines found in cars, to steam engines and turbines that powered massive industrial machines and generators. His deep understanding of the mechanical principles, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics involved in the function of engines had made him an authority in the field. However, this same man found himself unable to write instructions for building houses because his knowledge and experience did not extend to civil engineering and architecture. While mechanical engineering primarily focuses on the design, development, and analysis of mechanisms and machines, civil engineering concerns the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of various infrastructures such as roads, bridges, buildings, and other physical facilities.  Building a house involves understanding materials and their varying properties, like wood, steel, concrete, and bricks, as well as accounting for factors like the structural stability of the building, environmental stresses, and local building codes and regulations. Furthermore, architectural design principles such as aesthetics, functionality, and spatial optimization need to be considered in order to create a comfortable and efficient living space. Such considerations are quite distant from the man's area of expertise, which lies primarily in the mechanical realm. Though engineering, in general, focuses on problem-solving and design, there are distinct differences between the various disciplines. In mechanical engineering, the man would rely on Newton's laws of motion, equations relating to heat transfer and fluid dynamics, and principles of materials science to optimize the performance of engines. In contrast, with civil engineering and architecture, the knowledge required extends to concepts such as soil mechanics, structural analysis, and urban planning – all of which are critical factors in designing and constructing houses. The man could certainly attempt to learn civil engineering and architectural principles, but this would likely take a significant amount of time, involving additional education, research, and hands-on experience. Moreover, writing instructions for building houses would require not only an understanding of these principles but also a familiarity with the specific types of materials and techniques utilized in a given region, to account for differences in climate, culture, and aesthetics. In conclusion, the man could write comprehensive instructions for building engines, drawing from his considerable knowledge and experience in mechanical engineering. But when it comes to constructing houses, his lack of knowledge and experience in the fields of civil engineering and architecture hinder his ability to generate detailed guidance on the subject. Such a task would require an expanded understanding of the relevant principles and context, proper interdisciplinary collaboration, or even a significant investment of time and effort in acquiring new knowledge and skills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even in the deep of night the stones of Gazu Kadem kept the city warm. Now, at mid-day, it was at its hottest. A quarter of a million people at the arena didn't make it any cooler. The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed. His soldiers watched the games in silence. They made not a sound when twelve of the most beautiful girls to walk on small bare feet were raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual to Gazu Kadem's god-king, Danken Ovelde.

Answer:","output":"In mythology, the Greek equivalent of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, is Hephaestus. Hephaestus is the Greek god of fire, metalworking, blacksmithing, and craftsmanship, among other things. His role in mythology is similar to that of Vulcan, who is worshipped in Roman mythology as the god of fire and the forge. Both Vulcan and Hephaestus are known for their roles as divine craftsmen and their abilities to create powerful and intricate weapons, jewelry, and other important artifacts for the gods and heroes. In ancient Greek mythology, Hephaestus is the son of the king and queen of the gods, Zeus and Hera. However, he was born with a physical disability, which has been depicted in varying ways throughout history – sometimes as a noticeable limp or as malformed legs. His imperfections set him apart from the other gods, who were often portrayed as perfect and beautiful in mythology. Out of embarrassment and anger, it is said that Hera either threw Hephaestus from Mount Olympus or that he willingly chose to leave. As a result, he was separated from the other gods and took up residence in his workshop below the earth, where he forged many powerful and impressive artifacts. Hephaestus is frequently associated with the forge and the anvil, which serve as symbols of his realm and are used to represent his mastery of the metalworking and blacksmithing arts. In addition to producing magnificent works for the gods, he is also known for creating many famous and supernatural items for mortal heroes in Greek mythology. Some of the most iconic weapons and artifacts that Hephaestus crafted include the divine armor of Achilles, the Aegis shield for Athena, and the invisible helmet for the hero Perseus. Despite his physical imperfections, Hephaestus was revered as an important god in Greece. He was a prominent figure in many Greek stories and myths and was worshipped in several major cities and sanctuaries, such as Athens, Lemnos, and the Hephaestia festival, which was held in his honor. The god was also the patron deity of blacksmiths, metallurgists, potters, and other artisans, who looked to him for inspiration, guidance, and protection in their work. In Roman mythology, Vulcan shares many similar attributes and responsibilities with his Greek counterpart. However, while their roles and natures are similar, there are slight differences in the stories and representations of the two deities. Vulcan is the son of Jupiter, the king of the gods, and Juno, the queen of the gods, and he is more prominently associated with destructive and chaotic fires, such as volcanic eruptions, compared to the more creative and artistic aspects of Hephaestus. Nevertheless, both gods are highly skilled and celebrated craftsmen who created essential tools, weapons, and artifacts for the gods and mortals alike, making them significant figures in their respective mythologies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scarpia, now alone with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances, but she hears the drums outside announcing an execution. As Scarpia awaits her decision, she prays, asking why God has abandoned her in her hour of need: \\"Vissi d'arte\\" (\\"I lived for art\\"). She tries to offer money, but Scarpia isn't interested in that kind of bribe: he wants Tosca herself. Spoletta returns with the news that Angelotti has killed himself upon discovery, and that everything is in place for Cavaradossi's execution.

Given the question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"in which province islamabad is located?\\" The answer is:","output":"Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan, is not located within any of the country's four provinces. Instead, it is situated in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). The Islamabad Capital Territory is a federally administered region that was established to serve as the capital city of Pakistan, separate from the provinces. The decision to create a new capital was made in the 1960s in order to promote national unity, as the previous capital, Karachi, was located in the province of Sindh and was considered too distant and provincial for the purposes of a federal capital. The Islamabad Capital Territory is located in the north-eastern part of Pakistan, adjacent to the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Its total area is about 906 square kilometers (350 square miles), and it encompasses the urban city of Islamabad, as well as rural areas and natural reserves. The ICT was established under the Constitution of Pakistan, and it is directly administered by the federal government. Islamabad is a planned city, and its design was carefully crafted by Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis. Its construction began in 1961, and the city was officially declared as the capital of Pakistan in 1966. Islamabad was chosen for its strategic location, natural beauty, and a relatively mild climate. The city is surrounded by the beautiful Margalla Hills, which form part of the Murree hills range, and it has a contemporary urban layout, well-maintained infrastructure, and numerous public parks and green spaces. The ICT is governed by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation, the Capital Development Authority, and the Islamabad Capital Territory Administration. The elected mayor heads the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation, while the Chief Commissioner oversees the ICT administration. The city's urban design is organized into various sectors and zones, each serving different purposes and providing essential services such as housing, commercial activities, and recreational spaces. In summary, although it is common for people to ask in which province Islamabad is located, the correct answer is that it is not part of any province. Instead, it is situated within the Islamabad Capital Territory and serves as the capital city of Pakistan. This unique arrangement helps ensure that the Pakistani capital remains neutral and impartial from the influence of any particular province, allowing it to more effectively fulfill its role as the seat of the federal government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Great Lakes states approve U.S. city's plan to draw water from Lake Michigan A suburban Milwaukee city won a hard-fought battle Tuesday to draw its drinking water from Lake Michigan in the first test of a compact designed to safeguard the Great Lakes region's abundant but vulnerable fresh water supply. A panel representing governors of the eight states adjoining the lakes unanimously approved a proposal from Waukesha, Wis., which is under a court order to find a solution to radium contamination of its groundwater wells. The city says the project will cost 265 million Cdn for engineering studies, pipelines and other infrastructure. Waukesha is only 27 kilometres from the lake but just outside the Great Lakes watershed. That required the city of about 72,000 to get special permission under the compact, which prohibits most diversions of water across the watershed boundary. The 2008 pact established a potential exception for communities within counties that straddle the line. Waukesha is the first to request water under that provision. \\"There are a lot of emotions and politics surrounding this issue, but voting yes — in co-operation with our Great Lakes neighbours — is the best way to conserve one of our greatest natural resources,\\" Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said. Fear that Waukesha would set a precedent for a host of supplicants was one of the biggest obstacles in the city's quest to tap Lake Michigan, which began several years before the compact was signed. The region jealously guards access to the Great Lakes, which hold 95 per cent of the nation's surface fresh water. The Sun Belt's steady gains in population and political clout inspired Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to negotiate the pact in hopes of preventing raids from arid states. Ontario and Quebec adopted nearly identical legislation, although only the states were given legal authority to consider requests for U.S. water diversions. Ontario took issue with Waukesha's original plan and still isn't overly thrilled with the approval. \\"We remain apprehensive about any diversion by Waukesha and will continue to voice the concerns of Ontarians,\\" Jason Travers, director of Natural Resources Conservation Policy Branch for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, said in a written statement. Waukesha's initial application drew accusations of seeking more water than needed to support urban sprawl. The city won a conditional endorsement last month from another regional panel after making numerous changes. They included reducing the volume it would withdraw daily from 38.2 million litres to 31 million litres and shrinking its water service area. Waukesha said it would remove only a tiny fraction of Lake Michigan's supply and return the same amount as treated wastewater. \\"There will be virtually no net loss of water volume to the Great Lakes,\\" said Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, whose state abstained from last month's preliminary vote because of lingering concerns that he said Tuesday had been resolved. Amendments approved by the governors' representatives empower the states to enforce all provisions in the agreement with Waukesha. The Fox River flows through downtown Waukesha, Wis., but its groundwater is contaminated with radium. (John Flesher/Associated Press) Mayor Shawn Reilly said the city respected the conditions \\"and we are committed to compliance.\\" It will be at least a couple of years before Lake Michigan water begins flowing to Waukesha, he said. A Minnesota-based environmental coalition and the Sierra Club's Wisconsin chapter voiced disappointment with the governors' decision, as did Michigan's attorney general and two members of Congress. Critics said Waukesha had not exhausted other options, such as treating its groundwater for contamination. \\"Waukesha has known about elevated radium levels in their water supply for decades and has failed to act,\\" Reps. Debbie Dingell and Candice Miller of Michigan said, describing the decision as a failure for the compact that would undermine the region's water security. Other environmental groups that had opposed the plan before it was amended offered cautious support. \\"We will be strong watchdogs to ensure that the Great Lakes are protected,\\" the Alliance for the Great Lakes and the National Wildlife Federation said in a joint statement. ​In a 2013 report, the Alliance identified eight other cities near the watershed as potential suitors for Great Lakes water if Waukesha were approved, although none have announced such plans. Dan Injerd, the Illinois representative at Tuesday's meeting, said the fact that Waukesha spent a decade and millions of dollars on its bid would be a strong deterrent, showing that accessing Great Lakes water is \\"an extraordinarily difficult challenge.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about a city called Waukesha, which is near Milwaukee. They had a problem because the water under their city had something bad in it called radium. So, they asked permission to take water from a big lake called Lake Michigan. After thinking about it and making some changes, a group of people from nearby states said yes, Waukesha could take the water. But, they also made some rules that Waukesha has to follow. People had different feelings about the decision. Some were worried that many other cities would want to take water from the lake too. But others said that allowing Waukesha to have some water can actually help protect the big lake and its water for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

One can assume that if something acquires human capabilities, it should be able to perform tasks and exhibit behaviors that are similar to humans. Human capabilities encompass a wide range of skills and abilities, including physical, cognitive, and emotional. This may include problem-solving, creativity, empathy, communication, and the capacity to learn and adapt. Let us consider an AI or a robot as the subject in question. Technological advancements have led to the development of sophisticated AI systems that are designed to mimic human behaviors and perform tasks that were once exclusively within the human domain. They can communicate using natural language, recognize and process emotions, and even learn new tasks autonomously. Assuming that the premise is referring to an advanced AI system or a robot, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it is almost capable of behaving like a human. However, it is important to note that the term \\"almost\\" indicates that there is still room for improvement. It implies that the AI or robot has not yet reached the full range of human capabilities and may still lack certain traits or skills that would make it indistinguishable from a human being. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"It's nearly got human capabilities now,\\" the hypothesis \\"It's almost capable of behaving like a human\\" is true, as the premise suggests a high level of similarity between the subject's capabilities and those of humans.

Firstly, apple trees are commonly found in orchards, gardens, or cultivated landscapes where these trees are purposefully planted and cultivated for their fruit. In these settings, the fruit will typically fall on the ground within the confines of the cultivated area. Orchard owners and gardeners often place nets or other collection devices beneath the trees to catch the apples and minimize bruising or damage to the fruit from the impact with the ground.  Secondly, apple trees can also be found outside in parks or public spaces, where they have either been planted deliberately as a source of food and enjoyment for the public or have grown wild due to the dispersal of seeds by birds and other animals. In these cases, the fruit will fall on the ground, grass, or pathways within the park. This, in turn, provides an opportunity for passersby to collect and enjoy the fallen fruit, or for animals such as deer, squirrels, and birds to feast on the nutritious apples. Lastly, it is essential to mention that apple trees are not native to Uzbekistan. While Uzbekistan has a favorable climate for fruit cultivation, including grapes, apricots, and melons, apple trees are less likely to be encountered in this Central Asian country. However, it is still possible to find apple trees in private gardens, small orchards, or urban green spaces throughout Uzbekistan, and just like in any other location, the fallen apples can be found lying on the ground surrounding these trees. In conclusion, the best answer to where apple trees drop their fruit is \\"the ground,\\" given that it is the most common and natural surface upon which apples fall. However, the specific location and setting in which the apple trees are found (e.g., orchards, gardens, parks) may also provide additional context to the question and insights into where the tree's fruit can be found."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can't think of anyone else when you hear people read Confucius   2,500 year-old words: \\"All study but no thinking makes people puzzled.\\"  All thinking but no study makes people lazy. Tuesday was Confucius' birthday. He was born on September 28,551 BC in the Kingdom of Lu  , in today's Shandong Province. Chinese look upon Confucius as the greatest thinker and also the greatest teacher. He had about 3,000 students. For more than 2,000 years, Confucius' ideas have been around in people's everyday lives. Now they have gone far into Western countries and south Asia. People can still hear _ today. Why are his ideas so popular? They help not only in everyday life but also society. Confucius' most important ideas are kindness and good manners. Confucius said young people should take care of the old. People should give up thinking of themselves and work for others. As a great teacher, Confucius said that all should go to school if they wanted to learn. Some of Confucius' popular words are \\"A kind person should care others\\" and \\"Be strict with yourself, but be kind to others\\". People use his ideas to help themselves and society.

Question: suppose there are fewer predators happens, how will it affect fewer eggs will hatch.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If there are fewer predators in the environment, it is likely that more eggs will survive and hatch due to the decreased risk of being consumed by predators. This survival rate increase will result in a larger population of caterpillars in the early stages of their life cycle. However, the specific question seems to ask about the second effect mentioned, which is \\"the egg hatches.\\" In this context, the hatching of the eggs does not directly correlate with the number of predators. The more important factor affecting the hatching of the eggs is the environmental conditions, which include temperature, humidity, and the availability of suitable plants for the eggs to be laid on. If the reduced number of predators leads to a healthier ecosystem and better environmental conditions for the eggs, then this change could potentially have a positive, or more, effect on the number of eggs that hatch.  However, we should also consider the possible consequences of the increased number of successfully hatched eggs. While the environment might be sustainable for a certain number of caterpillars, an overpopulation could lead to increased competition for food resources. This competition could subsequently result in a detrimental effect on the growth of caterpillars as they may struggle to eat enough to reach their full length. This could, in turn, hinder their ability to form into a pupa, undergoing metamorphosis, and ultimately becoming a butterfly. Additionally, the increased number of caterpillars in the ecosystem might further lead to an imbalance in its food chain, putting additional pressure on plants as the primary food source for caterpillars. This might detrimentally affect the ecosystem, and in the long run, potentially lead to a decline in the number of butterflies that can successfully reach adulthood and fly away. In conclusion, while a decrease in predators could initially result in more eggs hatching due to their enhanced chances of survival, the butterfly population's long-term sustainability depends on various factors, including healthy ecological balance and competition for resources. This perturbation could have both positive and negative effects on different aspects of the butterfly's life cycle, making it difficult to conclusively determine whether the second effect mentioned - the egg hatching - will experience more, less, or no effect from the reduced predator numbers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer .  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002.  - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

Might be time to book a vacation to Antarctica. USA Today reports the Antarctic continent hit a record high temperature of 63.5 degrees on March 24, 2015. The World Meteorological Organization announced the record Wednesday (it can take years to verify record temperatures). The previous high temperature in Antarctica was 59 degrees in 1974. Antarctica's new high temperature was measured at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula, according to Reuters. Scientists are tracking high temperatures around the continent because the melting of Antarctic ice could significantly raise sea levels around the world. Expand this summary.","output":"Looking for a break from chilly winter weather? It might be time to consider booking a vacation to Antarctica, a destination that has recently been experiencing surprisingly warmer temperatures. In fact, on March 24, 2015, the continent reached a record high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit, as reported by USA Today. This unprecedented temperature spike was officially announced by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on Wednesday, after thorough verification processes that can take several years to complete. The previous highest temperature recorded in Antarctica was 59 degrees back in 1974, which means that the newest record high marks a significant increase of 4.5 degrees. This record-setting temperature was measured at Argentina's Esperanza Base, which is located on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is important to note that climate scientists and researchers are closely monitoring these high temperatures around the continent, as they hold significant implications for the environment. The melting of Antarctic ice due to increased temperatures has the potential to raise sea levels worldwide considerably, posing a threat to coastal areas and leading to significant consequences for marine life, ecosystems, and human populations. The rise in Antarctic temperatures can be linked to global warming caused by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions have led to significant increases in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere, trapping heat around the planet. As scientists continue to track temperature changes in Antarctica, they are also studying the effects of melting ice on sea levels, glacier dynamics, and the surrounding ecosystem. The loss of ice not only contributes to rising sea levels but also disrupts the habitats of numerous species native to Antarctica, such as penguins, seals, and various types of marine life. Moreover, the melting ice sheets have the potential to change ocean currents and disrupt weather patterns, leading to further climatic changes globally. In response to this concerning situation, many researchers and advocacy groups are calling for stronger global actions to mitigate climate change. This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, improving energy efficiency in buildings and transportation systems, and preserving and restoring forests to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. While booking a vacation to Antarctica might seem like an exciting escape from cold winter weather, it is essential that travelers and the global community remain aware of the implications of these record high temperatures. Indeed, they serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need to address climate change and work towards a more sustainable future for our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:You are given a new situation: During the summer Anthony found it was way too hot to be comfortable. He went out to his garage to get an old fan. The fan was spins on a metal bearing but because it is old it was slightly rusted. When he turned the fan on it spun very slow, struggling to move. He then decided to lubricate the bearing that rotates the fan blades and the fan started spinning normally.  and a hint : All machines make work easier, but they don’t increase the amount of work that is done. You can never get more work out of a machine than you put into it. In fact, a machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine. That’s because a machine must use some of the work put into it to overcome friction. Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines involve motion, so they all have friction. How much work is needed to overcome friction in a machine depends on the machine’s efficiency.  Please answer this question : Will reducing the friction in a machine make the machine require more or less work? A:","output":"Reducing the friction in a machine will make the machine require less work.  Step 1: Understand the problem In this situation, Anthony's fan has a rusted metal bearing, causing it to struggle to spin due to friction. The hint provided states that work put into a machine must also overcome the friction that opposes the motion of the machine. Step 2: Identifying the impact of friction on work Friction is the force that opposes motion between touching surfaces. In Anthony's fan, the rust on the metal bearing increased the friction, causing it to operate inefficiently and spin slower. Step 3: Consider the effect of lubrication When Anthony lubricates the bearing, he is reducing the friction between the metal surfaces, allowing the fan blades to rotate more freely. Step 4: Analyzing the relationship between friction and work As friction is reduced (in this case, by lubrication), the amount of work needed to overcome the friction is decreased. This means that the machine can operate more efficiently, as less work is being used to overcome friction and more work is being used for the intended purpose (spinning the fan blades). Conclusion: Reducing the friction in a machine, like Anthony's fan, will make the machine require less work, as it becomes more efficient by needing less work to overcome the friction between the moving parts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SLS is often used as a cheap filler to help toothpaste thicken and foam up. But this additive has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing canker sores in your mouth. Read the labels on toothpastes and mouthwashes to make sure they are free of SLS before you use them or search online for brands that specifically do not contain SLS. You can also follow good oral hygiene by choosing a soft bristle toothbrush to clean your teeth. Try to brush your teeth twice a day and after every meal.

Use 2.5 to 3 cups of water to 1 cup of amaranth. Simmer it in a covered pan for approximately 20 minutes.","output":"Afterwards, give it a bit of time to rest; simply turn off the heat, place the lid on the pot, and let the amaranth sit for about 10 minutes. As soon as the amaranth has finished resting, it should have absorbed all of the water and it will have a soft and creamy consistency similar to that of porridge. At this stage, fluff it gently with a fork, separating the grains and releasing the steam that has built up. There are countless ways in which you can serve amaranth, each with a unique mix of tastes and textures. It can be served plain as a side dish, or stirred into soups and stews to help thicken them while also adding a helpful nutritional boost. Amaranth has a slightly nutty flavor that pairs well with a variety of different ingredients. You could toss it in a vibrant vinaigrette and serve it alongside grilled meats, or stir in a handful of fresh herbs for a refreshing, fiber-packed lunch option.  Amaranth's unique texture also makes it a superb addition to salads, offering a pleasing crunch that complements an assortment of vegetables and grains. Also, like traditional grains such as rice and pasta, amaranth can be cooked, cooled, and then used as the base for a cold salad. For instance, you could combine cooled amaranth with diced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, olives, and crumbled feta for a Mediterranean flair. For breakfast, you could even cook amaranth in milk and sweeten it with honey or brown sugar, making a pseudo-cereal or smoothie bowl. Topped with fresh fruits, nuts, and seeds, this forms a power-packed start to your day. Amaranth can also be popped like popcorn and served as a fun, nutritious snack. Simply heat the seeds in a covered pan until they pop, and then season them with your choice of spices.  In terms of baking, amaranth flour adds a wonderful texture to cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. When mixed with other flours, it also adds a nutritive value to your baking products. Given its diverse nature, amaranth is a highly versatile grain and offers a lot of room for experimentation in the kitchen. Finally, always remember that properly storing amaranth in a cool, dry place is essential to retaining its freshness and nutritional value.

Write an article based on this summary: Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock says he has been told his side should appeal more for penalties, describing his players as \\"too honest\\".","output":"Title: Crystal Palace Manager Neil Warnock Calls for More Appeals for Penalties, Praises Players for Honesty Introduction: Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock recently expressed his opinion on his side's approach towards penalties in football matches. While praising his players' honesty, Warnock mentioned that they should appeal more for penalties. Step 1: Describe the context of Warnock's statement During a recent interview, Neil Warnock, who is known for his no-nonsense approach and candid demeanor in dealing with the media, made a statement about the performance of his Crystal Palace side in terms of appealing penalties. He expressed his concern that his players might be losing out on potential penalty opportunities due to their honest nature.  Step 2: Explain the term \\"too honest\\" in the context of football penalties In football, there are instances when a player may initiate or exaggerate contact with an opponent in order to win a penalty. This act is often frowned upon by fans and pundits alike as it is deemed dishonest. Warnock's description of his players as \\"too honest\\" implies that they do not engage in such tactics and may miss out on opportunities for penalties as a result. Step 3: Discuss the implications of Warnock's suggestion on the team's performance and overall match strategy A team's approach to winning penalties can have a significant impact on their overall match strategy and performance. By appealing more for penalties, Crystal Palace players might be able to force referees to make decisions, potentially leading to more penalty opportunities and improved chances of scoring. In close matches, these decisions can often be the deciding factor between winning and losing. Step 4: Highlight the pros and cons of adopting Warnock's suggestion On one hand, adopting Warnock's suggestion to appeal more for penalties can potentially result in increased chances for the team to score goals and consequently win matches. Apart from the obvious advantage of scoring more goals, this approach may also lead to increased confidence among the players and more aggressive gameplay. On the other hand, the act of exaggerating contact or initiating fouls for penalties is generally considered dishonest and unsportsmanlike. This may not only tarnish the reputation of the team, but also put them at risk of facing sanctions such as fines or suspensions from football governing bodies. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that increased appeals will translate into more penalties awarded, as referees might become more cautious in making decisions. Conclusion: While Neil Warnock's suggestion to appeal more for penalties could potentially improve Crystal Palace's chances of scoring and winning matches, the cost to the team's reputation and fairness may be too great. Ultimately, it remains the responsibility of the manager and the players to balance the urgency for victory with the principles of sportsmanship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The price range of the offerings on its menu positions it as a budget-friendly joint with meals counting less than £20, hence making it a potential point of attraction for students, young professionals or those looking for an inexpensive gastronomic adventure. Nevertheless, what drags it down substantially is its less than impressive customer ratings implying that the quality of service or food might not be up to par and therefore, caution might be employed before finalizing it as a dining destination. A low customer rating often paints a picture of unsatisfactory experiences such as delayed service, less-than-adequate hygiene, or food quality that fails to match up to the expectations of the venturing clientele. Therefore, while The Wrestlers may be easy on the pocket, potential patrons need to weigh their excitement for inexpensive meals against the possibility of a less than stellar dining experience.

Article: Heroes of Our Time A good heart  Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa among great poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine--but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his fortune with others. He built a new hospital in his old hometown in the Congo. A friend has said of this goodhearted man: \\" Mutombo believes that God has given him this chance to do great things.\\" Success and kindness     After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children's videos in her own house. The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her business grew to more than 20 million in sales. And she is using her success to help others--producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new program: \\" I believe it's the most important thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe.\\" Bravery and courage     A few weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlen subway station with his two little girls when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: \\" We have got to show each other some love.\\" Question: Mutombo believes that building the new hospital is   _  . Answer: Answer:","output":"Mutombo believes that building the new hospital is an opportunity to give back to his community and to utilize the blessings and fortune he has been given. He considers this act not just as an endeavor of community service, but as a personal responsibility and duty to share his success with others less fortunate, particularly in the land of his birth - the Congo. For Mutombo, building the hospital isn't simply a charitable act, but a manifestation of his belief in using the advantages and opportunities granted to him for the purpose of achieving great things — especially fundamental and transformative change in the lives of those struggling back in his hometown. His friend's statement about him suggests that Mutombo sees this as a divine mandate, a chance given by God to significantly impact and improve the lives of his fellow countrymen and leave a lasting legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the difference between virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Options: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"[i] no; While the two questions seem similar, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks specifically about the differences between virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR), while the second question explores the differences between three related but different technologies: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). To address both questions, let's explore each technology individually and their differences: 1. Virtual Reality (VR): Virtual reality creates a completely computer-generated environment, immersing the user in a virtual world separate from the real world. Users wear a VR headset or head-mounted display (HMD) and often use controllers or other peripherals to interact with the virtual environment. VR can create entirely unique experiences unrelated to the user's physical surroundings, and it is commonly used in gaming, simulations, and training programs. 2. Augmented Reality (AR): Augmented reality overlays digital or virtual information onto the user's real-world environment. For example, a user might see text, images, or 3D models superimposed onto their physical surroundings through their smartphone screen or AR glasses. AR aims to enhance the real world with additional information, rather than replacing the user's surroundings. Some popular applications of AR include smartphone apps for navigation, gaming, and education. 3. Mixed Reality (MR): Mixed reality, also referred to as hybrid reality, combines elements of both VR and AR. It creates a blend of physical and digital content, allowing the virtual and real-world objects to interact. MR-enabled devices commonly use cameras and sensors to track the real-world environment, allowing virtual objects to be displayed and manipulated in the user's space. Mixed reality experiences can range from primarily real-world environments with some virtual elements to primarily virtual environments with some real-world interaction. MR has potential for numerous applications, from entertainment and gaming to collaboration and engineering. Now, let's summarize the differences: - The first question asks about the difference between VR and MR. Virtual reality is a fully immersive environment disconnected from the real world, while mixed reality combines real and virtual elements in the same environment, allowing for more interaction between digital and physical objects. - The second question involves all three technologies. In summary, virtual reality immerses users in a completely computer-generated environment, augmented reality overlays digital information on the real world, and mixed reality combines aspects of both VR and AR, blending the physical and digital environments. Conclusively, although the questions address related issues, they are not paraphrases of each other because they focus on different comparisons within the realms of VR, AR, and MR."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Do Haredi Jews tend to have large or small families?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"Do Haredi Jews tend to have large or small families?\\" This statement substantiates that Haredi Jews usually have large families. The sentence prominently highlights the family size of Haredi Jews, a particular Jewish Orthodox group known for their stringent observance of Jewish religious laws and traditions. The use of the term \\"extremely large\\" is significant because it implies a family size that greatly exceeds the norm or average, suggesting not just more than two or three children, but potentially many more. There are many social, cultural, and religious reasons behind this tendency. One primary factor is the strong emphasis on the principle of procreation in Haredi Jewish culture, which encourages families to have as many children as possible. This is not only seen as the fulfilment of a religious obligation but also as a way of strengthening their community. Additional factors can include a lack of birth control, cultural norms, and the role of family in their community. Additionally, the word \\"often\\" in the sentence is critical. It doesn't imply that this is the case with all Haredi Jews, but it suggests that it is a common pattern or trend within this group. However, it is also important to remember that while a sentence can be generally accurate, there will always be exceptions to any generalization. Finally, the term \\"noteworthy\\" suggests that this trend is distinctive or striking, something that stands out when studying or observing Haredi Jewish families. It might also imply that this pattern contradicts what is typical or expected in other societies or cultures, highlighting the notable differences between the familial norms of Haredi Jews and other societal groups.  In conclusion, it's not only that the sentence provides a valid answer, but it also puts the answer in a specific context related to the particular cultural and religious practices of the Haredi Jews."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: America's painful doctor shortage is threatening health care reform By Shawn Tully, senior editor-at-large FORTUNE -- The new federal budget, unveiled on Tue., March 4, trumpets a major shift in America's policy toward one of the most vexing problems in reforming our health care system: fixing the doctor shortage. Since 1997, the number of physicians entering the workforce each year has essentially been capped, while the demand for everything from hip replacements to treatments for diabetes to angioplasties has soared with our growing and aging population. Now, the Obama administration proposes spending an additional 5.23 billion over the next decade to mint new physicians. That sounds like a lot of money, and the proposal sounds like a big deal, because it officially breaks the old bottleneck that limits the supply of manpower we desperately need. But it doesn't go nearly far enough. The proposal is designed to swell the ranks of primary care doctors. Those family physicians, general internists, and pediatricians constitute the workforce that, far more than any other type of physician, is charged with making Obamacare -- and the general shift from fee-for-service to managing giant populations of patients at reduced cost -- the new paradigm for health care delivery. Unfortunately, the new policy is a timid response to a looming crisis. Based on current demographic trends alone, today's dearth of primary care practitioners is destined to get far worse. As a result, prices are rising, and competition is falling, as big hospital groups rush to hire all the primary care doctors they can find. Once one or two big chains control most of the family doctors and general internists in their markets, rivals can't find the troops to challenge them. That's creating oligopolies in markets across the nation. \\"The game today is, 'He who gets the most primary care doctors wins,'\\" says Travis Singleton, executive vice president of Merritt Hawkins, the nation's largest physician recruiting firm, and a division of AMN Healthcare (AHS). MORE: How one hospital is thriving in the age of Obamacare Because the shortage is so deep and the investment so modest -- a little more than 500 million a year -- the new measure fails to reverse the policy that caused the problem in the first place. The flow of doctors entering the market each year is determined by the number of U.S. residency positions, chiefly in teaching hospitals. Those positions are funded primarily by the program that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. In 1997, the federal government essentially froze spending on residency slots, limiting the number to around 100,000 over three-to-four years, and in turn freezing the number of newly licensed physicians available for hire each year to around 26,000. Over the past 17 years, a few hospitals have established new residency programs for primary care doctors, raising the number to around 27,000, or a less than 4% increase. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has risen by 50 million, or almost 20%. Of those new doctors, only around one-quarter, or 7,000 a year, enter primary care. The reason is obvious: Family doctors earn salaries averaging 185,000 a year, vs. 336,000 for general surgeons and 266,000 for OB/GYNs, according to Merritt Hawkins. But those relatively few family doctors, general internists, and pediatricians are in incredibly high demand. At Merritt Hawkins, the searches for family doctors far exceeds those for any other category. The American Association of Medical Colleges estimates that the U.S. will face a shortage of 46,000 primary care doctors by 2020, equivalent to one-quarter of everyone practicing in that category today. And even though the total number of doctors has risen slightly over the past decade, the total hours they work each week has actually declined, and keeps dropping, as more and more physicians collect paychecks from hospitals and large medical groups. And while it's well known that rural communities are in desperate need for more primary care practitioners, the problem is universal: Around 50% of Merritt Hawkins' searches for PCs are in towns and cities with populations exceeding 100,000. MORE: The hidden number key to Obamacare's success To fulfill the needs of the marketplace, the American Association of Medical Colleges has long advocated creating 12 new medical schools and increasing enrollment by 30% -- a shift that would eventually create an additional 8,000 doctors a year. Once again, the cap on residency slots renders that plan impossible. Indeed, the current proposal falls far short of the AAMC recommendation. The new budget would create a total of 1,300 new residency slots, all for primary care. It would also allocate almost 4 billion over 10 years to grow the National Health Service Corps, an organization that provides loan forgiveness and scholarships to doctors who work in underserved areas for three to five years after graduation. \\"Keep in mind that this proposal does not create 1,300 new doctors a year,\\" says Dr Richard Cooper, an expert on physician supply issues. \\"Those slots are divided over more than three years, so that's about 400 slots a year.\\" Hence, the total addition to the doctor workforce will amount to about 400 new doctors annually, or an increase of 1.5%. That figure might not seem so insignificant if physician assistants and nurse practitioners could fill the gap. But that won't happen. All told, those two categories of advanced practitioners encompass around 200,000. The total is growing, but the number practicing primary care is actually declining. Once again, both the NPs and PAs are in extremely short supply; Merritt Hawkins searches for the two professions jumped 164% from 2011 to 2013. MORE: My afternoon with Imelda Marcos Above all, health care reform needs basic, primary care to succeed as planned. Even before the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the market was moving decisively towards a model called Population Health Management. Instead of relying on fee-for-service, those plans provide coverage for many thousands of patients in a community or city, and require that doctors and hospitals work together in teams to manage the patients' overall care, eliminating unnecessary procedures, and ordering tests and referrals to specialists only when needed. Obamacare hastened the trend by advocating so-called accountable care organizations (ACOs) -- giant, integrated groups of physician practices and hospitals that meet a long list of requirements established by Medicare, including expertise in compiling electronic medical records, following clinical protocols for diabetes or cardiac patients, and most of all, assigning each patient a family doctor or internist to coordinate all care and handle referrals to specialists. The primary care practitioner is hence the essential \\"raw material\\" for the new medical industry. If oil or grain is in short supply, the food or energy markets will fail to function. It's the same story in health care. The ACO regulations require that each provider cover a population of at least 5,000 patients. The need for broad size and scope has led to a flood of mergers among hospitals. Last year, Merritt Hawkins performed 64% of its searches for doctors who work in hospitals, on a salary, compared to 11% in 2004. It does another 16% of its recruiting for large medical groups, where physicians also get a paycheck. \\"Hospitals are trying to buy every physician group they can, they want to hire 30 or 40 primary care doctors at a time,\\" says Singleton. MORE: Why Republicans are giving in to get ahead The wave of mergers is creating high levels of concentration in many markets, for both hospital and physician services. \\"Hospitals are acquiring physician practices to enhance their pricing power,\\" says Robert Town, a professor at the Wharton School. \\"It's clear that if you hire most of few primary care doctors available, it enhances pricing power even more.\\" Kaiser Permanente in California, and Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City are just two examples of providers with powerful networks and huge market shares. The recent merger of Baylor Health Care and physician group Scott & White could reduce the bargaining clout of companies and insurers in the Texas market. In a recent survey, Merritt Hawkins finds that waiting time to see most practitioners hasn't changed much recently. But it's still substantial -- an average of 18.5 days for a new patient to visit a doctor in 15 of America's biggest cities. As the doctor shortage gets worse, so will those waiting times. Most of all, the shortage of primary care doctors poses a fundamental economic problem. When supply is short, and demand strong -- and no one denies that Obamacare's generous subsidies will make it far stronger -- market prices rise. Increasingly, Medicare and Medicaid set reimbursement rates at rates far below the \\"market clearing\\" levels that ensure patients get full access to care. As a result, 55% of all doctors refuse Medicaid beneficiaries, up from 45% in 2009, and a full one-quarter won't see Medicare patients. The solution is far more funding for residency positions, and licensing of highly qualified doctors who've completed programs in other nations and want to work in the U.S. Hospitals that want to train more primary care doctors at their own or the future doctor's expense should be encouraged to do so. The reigning concept contradicts itself: providing universal health care while limiting the essential personnel needed to provide it. Without fixing the doctor shortage, reforming the health care system is a fantasy. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article discusses the doctor shortage in America and its impact on health care reform. Some of the most important parts are: 1. The Obama administration proposes spending an additional 5.23 billion over the next decade to train new physicians, aiming to address the doctor shortage that has been an issue since 1997. 2. The proposal is designed to increase the number of primary care doctors, a workforce crucial to the implementation of Obamacare and the shift from fee-for-service to managing large populations of patients at reduced cost. 3.

The main reason for this judgment is the ambiguity and structure of the sentence, which can lead to confusion for the reader or listener. In the sentence, the main subject is \\"John.\\" The verbs that describe what John is easy to do are \\"please\\" and \\"love.\\" However, the introduction of a second subject, \\"Mary,\\" without proper conjunction or preposition disrupts the parallelism and leads to ambiguity in the sentence. According to the sentence's structure, it seems that John is easy to please, and there is also an intended meaning that John is easy to love. However, the placement of \\"Mary\\" at the end of the sentence suggests that John is easy to love Mary, which doesn't provide a clear and coherent meaning. It would be more appropriate to reconstruct the sentence to avoid confusion and ensure linguistic acceptability. To revise the sentence based on its intended meaning, there are a couple of alternative, linguistically acceptable ways to express the same idea: 1. John is easy to please, and it is easy to love Mary. In this alternative, we have maintained the two subjects, \\"John\\" and \\"Mary.\\" The verbs \\"please\\" and \\"love\\" are now associated with the subjects individually, and the use of a proper conjunction (\\"and\\") ensures better clarity for the reader. 2.

Options: - hang in closet - sniff - get dirty - become soiled - air out  The answer is \\"air out\\" because Answer:","output":"The ideal solution for clothes that have developed a smell but are unable to be washed promptly is airing them out. Here's why: First and foremost, airing out clothes is an effective way to eliminate sweat, smoke, cooking odors, and other smells that your clothing might have absorbed. This is because, when you expose your clothes to the fresh air, specifically outdoors, the air circulates through the tissues of your clothing, eliminating the odor trapped in there, and replaces it with a fresh, natural scent. Airing out clothes essentially deodorizes them, without needing to put them through a wash cycle. In contrast, the other options that you proposed are less effective. Hanging your smelly clothes in the closet doesn't actually solve the problem. It simply masks it temporarily and might even spread the smell to other clothes in the closet, as there is little fresh air in the closet to help dissipate the odor. Moreover, the confined space would only serve to concentrate the smell, making it more potent over time. Sniffing the clothes may seem like a strange option, as it doesn't directly address or remove the smell in any way. Sniffing will only confirm that the clothes do indeed smell. The options of \\"get dirty\\" and \\"become soiled\\" are also not feasible solutions. Making the clothes even dirtier or more soiled in order to mask the smell won't eliminate the underlying issue, and could potentially create a new, even more unfavorable, odor.  Lastly, washing is the best way to completely clean your clothes and get rid of all types of odors, but sometimes it might not be immediately possible due to lack of time, broken washing machine, water shortage or too delicate fabric. During these times, airing out clothes, especially in an open and sunlit space, is a safe, convenient, and practical solution. The UV rays from the sun also have a natural disinfecting property, helping to kill bacteria that could contribute to the development of a smell.  Therefore, among these options, airing out your clothes is the most effective method to eliminate unpleasant odors when washing is not an immediate option."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems -   Question: suppose there is less damange by acid rain happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If there is less damage by acid rain, it is likely to have a lessened impact on the overall consequences of the acid rain, including the second effect mentioned, which is the absorption of aluminum from the soil. However, it is important to understand the entire chain of events and how each part of the ecosystem would be affected by such a perturbation.  To reiterate the process: 1. Acid rain makes waters acidic. 2. Acidic waters cause aluminum to be absorbed from the soil. 3. The water, now containing aluminum, runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc. 4. Fish and their eggs die due to increased aluminum content in the water. 5. Frogs, which rely on these aquatic life forms for food, die. 6. Plants die due to the lack of nutrients from the soil and polluted waters. 7. Insects and other wildlife reliant on these plants die. 8. The ecosystem's balance is disrupted, which may lead to further problems. Now, let's consider the scenario where the damage from acid rain is reduced. This could be due to stricter regulations on air pollution, reduction in fossil fuel consumption, or simply a reduction in the amount of nitrogen and sulfur being emitted into the atmosphere. With less acid rain, the waters would be less acidic, meaning less aluminum would be absorbed from the soil. As a result of this reduction in aluminum absorption, there would be a direct effect on the second event (and the following events) in the process: - The water running off into lakes and streams would have lower aluminum levels, which would be less harmful to fish and their eggs. This would consequently mean a higher survival rate for the fish. - With more fish surviving, the predator-prey balance between frogs and fish would be more stable, leading to fewer frogs dying. - The healthier aquatic ecosystem might positively affect plants, due to the interdependence of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. A reduction in aluminum-absorbing waters could also mean that plants have access to better-quality water and are less likely to die. - As the plant population remains stable or grows, the insects and other wildlife that depend on them would continue to thrive, leading to an overall healthier ecosystem. In conclusion, if there is less damage caused by acid rain, it would lead to a reduced effect on the absorption of aluminum from the soil. This, in turn, would have a cascading effect of mitigating the other negative consequences throughout the ecosystem, ultimately making it less vulnerable to damage caused by acid rain."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a news article: Concerned Women for America, the right-leaning women’s group, is calling on Herman Cain to say whether he faced complaints about his personal behavior from female employees at the National Restaurant Association who later left the organization with financial settlements.      CWA president Penny Nance told POLITICO: “I think Herman Cain needs to directly answer the question.”      “Early in my career I resigned from a trade association for the exact same reason and with no financial settlement. I simply found another job,” Nance said. “Therefore, I know in a very personal way that sexual harassment exists and that it's demeaning and painful. It should never be tolerated in the workforce and certainly not the White House.”      She continued, though, saying the report of sexually suggestive behavior toward women was not “consistent with my experience with Herman Cain.”      “I have to say in all fairness that this characterization is completely contrary to the Herman Cain I know. Herman Cain has only been 100% respectful and deferential to me. I have never heard other women in conservative political circles complain of his behavior and they would complain loudly,” Nance said. “Our character and reputations are really all we have at the end of the day. Before I besmirch Herman Cain's I would need more than this.”      POLITICO reported Sunday night that Cain was accused of inappropriate behavior by multiple employees at the National Restaurant Association; the trade group reached financial settlements with several women who also left their jobs.      The biggest question for Cain, as the week begins, is whether he will be able to rally the GOP base to his defense or whether his staunchest supporters will abandon him in the wake of the allegations. And that, in turn, probably depends on whether Cain can definitively address the charges and give the answers conservatives like Nance are looking for.      Former White House press secretary Dana Perino increased the pressure on Cain in a morning appearance on “Fox and Friends.” The George W. Bush administration alum said the Cain campaign’s equivocal answers about whether there had been settlements with NRA employees would not “be enough, for Herman Cain.”      “Cain … will have to stand on his own two feet for the rest of the week,” she said. “Herman Cain has to have a better answer to the type of question that Geraldo asked when he goes on TV later today.” ||||| MICHELE BACHMANN      June Iowa Poll: 22 percent      October Iowa Poll: 8 percent      Bachmann lands in fourth place — a 14-point tumble since June.      The U.S. representative from Minnesota, 55, campaigns in churches and pitches herself as a child of Christ, but even voters who identify themselves as born-again Christians aren’t going her way. Among that key caucus constituency, 11 percent pick Bachmann as their first choice. (Herman Cain is at 26 percent.) And she’s the second choice of only 6 percent, the new poll shows.      Bachmann claims this is the year conservatives don’t have to compromise by nominating a more moderate candidate. More likely caucusgoers agree with her than not. But among that group, she ties for third with Ron Paul at 10 percent.      And her history of founding the tea party caucus in Congress gets her a little mileage. Among tea party supporters, Bachmann ranks fourth (10 percent) after Cain (27 percent), Romney (15 percent) and Paul (13 percent).      The Waterloo native had as good a launch as a campaign could orchestrate: a shining debate showing on June 13, a heady surge to second place in the June Iowa Poll, a formal announcement in her birthplace, and a victory in the Iowa straw poll on Aug. 13.      Then Rick Perry’s entry in the race on straw poll day snuffed out her candlepower. Today, she’s 1 point ahead of him in Iowa.      HERMAN CAIN      June Iowa Poll: 10 percent      October Iowa Poll: 23 percent      Cain, 65, a former executive for Burger King and Godfather’s Pizza, has risen 13 points since June, even though he’s visited Iowa just once since mid-August.      He’s defying the playbook for doing well in Iowa. So what’s the secret in his sauce?      Men give Cain his first-place showing: 26 percent prefer him; Mitt Romney gets 18 percent. (For women, it is almost an exact flip; they prefer Romney 27 percent to Cain’s 17 percent.)      The furthest-right voters are under Cain’s thumb. Of those who say they’re “very” conservative, 24 percent go to Cain. Michele Bachmann ranks at 12 percent, then Newt Gingrich at 11 percent.      Cain also has upside potential with secondary votes. Nineteen percent pick him as their second choice, ahead of Gingrich (13 percent) and Romney (11 percent).      Add first or second choice together, and the race is less competitive: Cain claims 42 percent to Romney’s 33 percent.      Several poll participants interviewed said they regretted voting for Bachmann or others at the Iowa straw poll the instant they heard Cain speak. But he was the last to take the stage, and by then it was too late.      NEWT GINGRICH      June Iowa Poll: 7 percent      October Iowa Poll: 7 percent      Gingrich, 68, the key face of Republican opposition to Democrats during President Bill Clinton’s administration, is tied for fifth place with Rick Perry.      The former U.S. House speaker earned the most enthusiastic crowd response of any of the six candidates at the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition forum on Oct. 22, the day before this poll went into the field. But Gingrich has the same level of support at 7 percent as he had in June.      The June poll was conducted not long after he used the word “radical” to describe U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to privatize Medicare, and more than 40 percent of respondents at the time said they had an unfavorable view of him.      Now, 9 percent of likely caucusgoers say they like him the least, a better ranking than Michele Bachmann (16 percent), Mitt Romney (14 percent), Ron Paul (12 percent) and Rick Perry (11 percent).      Were something to arise during the campaign to lessen Herman Cain’s appeal, Romney would be the biggest beneficiary — but Gingrich is next. He would get 23 percent of Cain defectors.      JON HUNTSMAN            June Iowa Poll: 2 percent      October Iowa Poll: 1 percent      Huntsman, 51, a relatively moderate Republican who served as President Barack Obama’s ambassador to China, finishes at the bottom of the poll.      Huntsman, who lives in Washington, D.C., has said he won’t compete in Iowa, citing his opposition to ethanol subsidies. But there are other issues where he’s at odds with most Iowa Republicans, such as his support as Utah’s governor for civil unions for same-sex couples.      He flitted briefly into Iowa in August for a nationally televised debate.      RON PAUL      June Iowa Poll: 7 percent      October Iowa Poll: 12 percent      Paul, 76, who is running for president for the third time, has risen into third place.      University of Northern Iowa political science professor Chris Larimer correctly pegged Paul’s current support without seeing the results of this poll: The Texas congressman is “still the most predictable candidate in terms of support, always finishing third with approximately 12 percent of the vote,” he said last week.      Paul routinely attracts big crowds of young adults with his message of less government, drug legalization and ending war. He drew 1,200 people to an Oct. 21 University of Iowa appearance.      This poll shows that Paul does better with younger voters than older people — he’s the first choice for 18 percent of those under 35. But it’s Mitt Romney who wins this age group, with 27 percent. Cain gets 21 percent.      RICK PERRY      June Iowa Poll: Not yet a candidate      October Iowa Poll: 7 percent      This is the first Iowa Poll measuring support for Rick Perry, 61, who entered the race in South Carolina on Iowa straw poll day, Aug. 13. He’s tied for fifth with Newt Gingrich at 7 percent.      On Aug. 6, the Texas governor set the tone for his pending campaign with a day of Christian prayers in Houston that drew 30,000 believers. He invited other governors to join him in praying for God’s guidance through the country’s moral and financial struggles.      Yet Perry finds support from just 7 percent of born-again Christians. Only Jon Huntsman fares worse with this group, at zero. Herman Cain does best, at 26 percent. Michele Bachmann is next at 11 percent.      Perry blazed to an Iowa polling zenith of 29 percent — 11 points ahead — in a Rasmussen Reports survey on Aug. 31. His numbers have collapsed since, attributed to his tangled speaking skills in debates.      He is now a second-tier candidate, said Christopher Larimer, a political science professor at the University of Northern Iowa.            MITT ROMNEY      June Iowa Poll: 23 percent      October Iowa Poll: 22 percent      Romney, 64, glides in at 22 percent, down one point from June. More than anything, this poll shows how polarized likely GOP caucusgoers are about him.      Romney is more popular than any other candidate with the under-35 age group. He’s the first choice for 27 percent of them, compared to 21 percent for Herman Cain and 18 percent for Ron Paul. He also is top choice among seniors, with 33 percent. Cain is at 15 percent, his poorest showing among any age group.      Among those who say their minds are made up, Romney gets 24 percent, tying with Paul for first.      Evangelical voters stalled his campaign here four years ago, and this survey shows they believe his social conservative bona fides are suspect. He’s at the bottom of their list, save for Jon Huntsman, who gets not a single vote.      Another big warning flag for Romney: Those who definitely intend to caucus don’t like him much. This group is 38 percent of those polled, but Romney is the first choice of just 10 percent of them. Cain is the strongest among definite attenders with 27 percent.      And likely caucusgoers don’t see him as their backup: 11 percent designated him their second choice, behind Cain and Gingrich.      RICK SANTORUM      June Iowa Poll: 4 percent      October Iowa Poll: 5 percent      Santorum, 53, a religious conservative who has positioned himself as the steadiest anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage voice in the race, leads the candidates in the number of Iowa campaign visits, long considered a linchpin to success in Iowa.      But born-again Christians have not rallied around Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania. He ties with Mitt Romney at 9 percent. Herman Cain leads with this group at 26 percent.      Santorum intends to barnstorm about 20 Iowa counties this week to reach the every-county mark of 99.      Christopher Larimer, a political science professor at the University of Northern Iowa, wonders whether 2011 has ushered in a new style for success in Iowa.      “(Tim) Pawlenty and Santorum ran traditional campaigns in terms of what has worked in the past, but both have failed to catch on in Iowa,” he said. “Maybe all the critics who argue Iowa allows candidates to advance who perform poorly at the national level won’t hold this year.”      Recommended Photos |||||       Republican Presidential hopeful Herman Cain campaigns in Talladega, Ala., Friday, Oct. 28, 2011. (Dave Martin/AP)      In four early primary states, according to recent CNN polls,Romney significantly outperformed Cain with female Republicans in every contest save South Carolina. In Iowa, where the two contenders are statistically tied, Romney took 28 percent of female voters and Cain got 17.      Politico reported Sunday that Cain was accused of sexual harassment by two former employees at the National Restaurant Association, which he led in the 1990s, and that the women left with financial settlements. Cain told Fox News Monday that he “never sexually harassed anyone” and “was falsely accused.”      If even more women turn against Cain, it could give Romney — who already does better with female than male voters — the chance to pull ahead in the GOP presidential primary.      The Des Moines Register wrote Sunday that in the new Iowa poll that showed Cain and Romney neck-and-neck, men were behind Cain’s success — 26 percent prefer him while only 18 percent backed Romney. The numbers were almost exactly the reverse for Romney with female respondents — the former governor beat Cain 27 to 17 percent.      A national CNN survey last week found Cain performing ten points better with men than with women while tying Romney overall. Fox News found similar results. And in recent Time magazine head-to-head matchups with President Obama, Romney was only 8 points behind Obama with women while Cain was 21 points back.      While conservatives rallied around Texas Gov. Rick Perry after the Post reported on a racial slur written on a rock at the candidate’s hunting camp, so far Cain has not gotten similar support.      Conservative Women for America, a right-leaning Christian group, is asked for more answers from Cain; the group’s president told Politico she once left a job due to sexual harassment. So did former White House press secretary Dana Perino said on Fox News Monday morning. Strategist Karl Rove and former National Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Tom Davis (R-Va.) also criticized Cain’s response. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article discusses allegations of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment against Herman Cain, a former Republican presidential candidate in the 2012 race. Concerned Women for America (CWA), a right-leaning women's group, called on Cain to address these allegations, which involved female employees at the National Restaurant Association. POLITICO had reported that multiple employees accused Cain of inappropriate behavior and financial settlements were reached with several women who then left their jobs. CWA president Penny Nance asked Cain to directly answer questions about the allegations, sharing her personal experience with sexual harassment and emphasizing that it should never be tolerated. She noted, however, that Cain's reported behavior was inconsistent with her experience with him. Cain continued to receive support from some conservative circles, but the article suggests that his ability to rally the GOP base to defend him might depend on how he addresses the allegations. Some high-profile Republicans like Dana Perino and Karl Rove criticized Cain's response. The article also provides a detailed analysis of various presidential candidate's positions and support in the polls, particularly focusing on the Iowa poll. Mitt Romney and Herman Cain were neck-and-neck at the time, with Romney doing better with female voters while Cain had more support from men.

Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \\"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\\" and \\"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system\\". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The new aspect in Google, implemented on November 6, 2013, is a change to the YouTube comment system that requires users to have a Google+ account in order to leave comments on videos. This modification aimed to address the frequent criticisms regarding the quality and tone of YouTube comments, as well as giving content creators greater control over moderating and blocking comments. By integrating the Google+ platform into YouTube's comment system, Google aimed to promote better and more relevant discussions by incorporating new sorting mechanisms that would prioritize higher-quality comments, pushing them to the top. This update also brought back the ability to include URLs in comments, which had been previously removed due to issues with abuse. However, this change was met with significant backlash from the YouTube community, including the platform's co-founder, Jawed Karim, who expressed his dissatisfaction with the requirement of a Google+ account to comment on videos. The official YouTube announcement generated over 20,000 \\"thumbs down\\" votes and sparked more than 32,000 comments within the first two days. Critics argued that Google was forcing users to adopt one of its less popular social media platforms, Google+, in order to maintain their ability to comment on YouTube videos. This change led to widespread outcry across internet forums and discussion boards and was highlighted in various articles, such as Chase Melvin's piece in Newsday's Silicon Island blog, which noted both the controversy surrounding the new comment system and the discontent with Google+ being enforced upon millions of YouTube users."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Ringo and his aunt Jessie Robbins  for the following movie plot:  The film begins as Ringo and his aunt Jessie Robbins walk hurriedly to catch the Magical Mystery Tour bus for an afternoon trip to the English countryside, double meaning on the word \\"trip\\", as a major punning tool for the late 60s, when everybody was dropping out, turning on, and tuning in. As an unidentified voice over narrates, this trip to the country has alternate layers of meaning and understanding and this is evident in the overbearing presence of Jolly Jimmy Johnson (Derek Royle), the tour guide. As the tour progresses other characters pop up to meet John and George and Paul. There is The Lovely Starlet (Maggie Wright) whom everyone wants to meet, and there is the strange Buster Bloodvessel (Ivor Cutler) who has fun saying his name, and there is The Accordionist (Shirley Evans) who leads everyone in a sing-a-long, and there is Miss Wendy Winters the Hostess (Mandy Weet) who keeps thing in perspective. As the tour continues there is a road rally with the bus and several other followers in cars such as a Bentley and a Mini Cooper. The scene shifts to 5 magicians (John, Paul, George and Ringo, and Mal Evans) in a remote castle as the voice over explains overseeing the position of the bus, and in some ways controlling its movement. As the bus stops for a tour of a military post an Army Sergeant (Victor Spinetti) barks directions and instructions in an indiscernible voice as the tour group follows him through the camp. Along the way the narrative of the bus tour is interrupted by musical interludes which introduce ideas and imaginations of Paul, George and John who are taking the tour. The bus later stops at a strip club and all the men disembark to watch a band The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band play a rendition of \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\" as The Stripper (Jan Carson) performs.

State Department Says U.S. Brought ‘Peace, Security’ to Syria in 2015      Over at the State Department’s official “DipNote” blog, John Kirby, the spokesperson for the department, is heralding Foggy Bottom’s 2015 accomplishments with the hashtag, #2015in5Words. In some cases, it’s a bit that works: For instance, the blog appropriately marks the thaw in relations with Cuba with, “Diplomatic Relations Re-established With Cuba.” However, in the case of Syria, the five words State used to describe the past year seem at the very least inappropriate and at the worst delusional.      The Syrian entry, dated Christmas eve, is entitled, “Bringing Peace, Security to Syria.” Kirby’s entry notes that the conflict there “has continued to unfold in tragic ways over the course of 2015,” including the humanitarian crisis forcing refugees to flee the Syrian civil war, and human rights violations by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Kirby continues, “The United States and many members of the international community have stepped up to aid the Syrian people during their time of need,” and argued that Secretary of State John Kerry is leading the push to get Assad out of office, and pressed the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution designed to begin the political transition from the Syrian strongman.      On the one hand, it’s understandable that State would note Syria in its 2015 roundup. The war there dominated headlines throughout the year, and leaving it off the list could draw more attention than actually including it.      On the other hand, it’s hard to argue that the United States brought any significant “peace” or “security” to the Syrian people. According to the United Nations, as of October 2015 some 250,000 people have been killed in more than four years of civil war (casualty figures for 2015 alone are not yet available). More than 11 million refugees have left the region, many of whom swelled onto European shores in the fall of 2015; it’s not clear how many will ever get asylum in Europe, or elsewhere around the world, including in the United States. A March 2015 UN report also noted that four in five Syrians are now living in poverty.      The Barack Obama administration, meanwhile, has struggled to keep pace with the rapidly deteriorating situation there. After spending years prioritizing Assad’s departure, Washington has now hinted that he could stay in power longer to aid in the fight against the Islamic State. The White House has also reluctantly found itself battling the Islamic State alongside Russia and Iran, staunch Assad supporters whose ultimate goals in Syria are unlikely to match those of the United States. After long promising there would be no American boots on the ground in Syria, meanwhile, President Obama signed off on the deployment of dozens of U.S. Special Operations personnel there. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the commandos are active in northern Syria, and are focused on building an anti-Islamic State partnership with Syrian Arab rebels.      Diplomats are ever careful in the language they use to describe international affairs. When it comes to Syria, “peace” and “security” might not be the best choice to describe what the United States delivered there in 2015. With Russia now complicating U.S. war plans for the region, it might be a long time coming until those two things can be established in a nation destroyed by years of war.

His message got me thinking about the pivotal foreign policy events that took place this year, and a great hashtag – #2015in5Words – which was recently trending on Twitter.      Surely the year was not without challenges. Our hearts are with the families that lost loved ones to terrorism, natural disasters, disease, and violence. Our work to secure our national interests and to build peace and enhance prosperity around the world continues in honor of them.      At the same time, it’s also important to take a step back and look at how the United States has helped change the world for the better. Our diplomats have been busy, and they have met with significant success across a range of issues – each of these issues vital in their own way to ensuring the safety, security, and prosperity of the American people. So, here's my take on #2015in5Words.      Diplomatic Relations Re-established With Cuba. #2015in5Words      U.S. and Cuba Re-establish Diplomatic Relations: In January, Cuba and the United States began talks to re-establish diplomatic relations after 54 years. Those talks resulted in the July re-opening of the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C. and the United States Embassy in Havana. To mark the occasion, Secretary Kerry traveled to Havana, Cuba, where he watched as the American flag was raised at the Embassy building there. By his side stood three retired U.S. Marines – the very same ones who lowered the flag at our Embassy in Havana more than five decades earlier. The achievement is just the first step in strengthening our relationship with the Cuban people, and those links continue to deepen with each new development, like the resumption of scheduled flights and mail delivery between our two countries. We look forward to further deepening these ties in the New Year.

This monumental summit launched an ongoing global CVE effort now underway that reaches throughout the world and across countless nations. Although challenges remain, we have made positive strides over the last year, including in our fight against ISIL. This forward progress will only continue as more countries pledge resources to the anti-ISIL effort and as citizens around the world increasingly reject ISIL's misguided ideology. Moving forward we know that together the global coalition – active both on the battlefield and on the airwaves – can and will degrade and ultimately destroy extremist organizations, like ISIL.

While there, he formally assumed the two-year chairmanship of the Arctic Council from his Canadian predecessor and announced that the Council would focus on three key themes: the impacts of climate change; promoting Arctic Ocean safety, security and stewardship; and improving economic and living conditions for Arctic communities. The Artic it is not just a picturesque landscape. It’s a home. It’s an ecosystem. It has a history. And we all have a duty to protect it and its people.

After weeks of intense multilateral negotiations on the ground in Vienna, it was announced that an agreement had been reached, one that would ensure Iran’s nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful. On that day Secretary Kerry spoke to the press, stating that “the agreement we’ve reached, fully implemented, will bring insight and accountability to Iran’s nuclear program – not for a small number of years, but for the lifetime of that program. This is the good deal that we have sought.” (More about the Iran Deal on DipNote)      Stemming Tide of Ebola Outbreak. #2015in5words      Ebola Response: August 2015 marked the one-year anniversary of the United States government’s robust response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa, an unprecedented effort that has helped turn the tide of an unprecedented outbreak. The United States was actively involved in fighting Ebola from the beginning, sending more than 3,000 people – including aid professionals, public-health specialists, soldiers and logisticians from USAID’s Disaster Assistance Response Team and the Center for Disease Control – to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea at the height of the response to support more than 10,000 civilian responders. Even as the situation on-the-ground improved over the course of 2015, the United States continued to respond to the crisis, working to contain the outbreak of the virus with the goal of getting to zero new infections. And while the Ebola outbreak now has been brought under control, the U.S. remains steadfast in working with its partners to ensure monitoring continues unabated so as to prevent any resurgence of the epidemic. Health crises like Ebola threaten the security of communities and countries. The United States remains committed to helping nations build capacity to prevent events like this in the future, and build a brighter world for our children.

During UNGA, President Obama pledged the United States’ support for the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), saying “in times of disaster and crisis, the world can count on the friendship and generosity of the American people.” While enormous progress has been made in tackling the development challenges that confront millions around the world, there is still much to be done and the SDGs mark an important milestone in to global effort to put our world on an inclusive and sustainable course moving forward.

Not only does this agreement set high standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property, but it will also serve to deepen our partnerships throughout the Asia-Pacific region – a message Secretary Kerry reinforced when he said, “With today's successful conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, the United States and 11 other nations have taken a critical step forward in strengthening our economic ties and deepening our strategic relationships in the Asia-Pacific region.” (More about Trade on DipNote)      Protecting Health of Our Ocean. #2015in5words      Second “Our Ocean” Conference: Also in October, the Chilean government hosted the second global “Our Ocean” conference in Valparaiso. During the conference -- which brought together individuals, experts, practitioners, advocates, lawmakers, and the international ocean and foreign policy communities to look at ways to protect our ocean -- the United States announced the creation of two new national marine sanctuaries. Secretary Kerry also used the opportunity to underscore three key areas for engagement: ocean monitoring, stopping illegal fishing, and climate change. The United States will host the next “Our Ocean” conference in 2016 demonstrating the Secretary’s personal commitment to making preservation of oceans a central part of our security agenda.

From the humanitarian crisis endured by refugees fleeing violence, to the reprehensible human rights violations and violence carried out by the Asad regime, the Syrian people have borne a heavy load. The United States and many members of the international community have stepped up to aid the Syrian people during their time of need – the United States has led the world in humanitarian aid contributions since the crisis began in 2011. Led by Secretary Kerry, the United States also continues to push for a political transition in Syria, and under his stewardship, in December, the UN Security Council passed a U.S.-sponsored resolution that puts forward a roadmap that will facilitate a transition within Syria to a credible, inclusive, nonsectarian government that is responsive to the needs of the Syrian people.

Pam Burkhart was played by several different actresses during the show's eight-season run from 1998 to 2006.  In Season 1 (1998-1999), Pam Burkhart was portrayed by actress Eve Plumb, who is best known for her role as Jan Brady on the classic 1970s sitcom \\"The Brady Bunch.\\" Plumb appeared as Pam in the episode titled \\"The Career Day.\\" It was the only episode Plumb played the role of Jackie's mom. Actress Brooke Shields then took over the role of Pam Burkhart from Season 6 to Season 7 (2002-2004). Shields, a model and actress who rose to fame for her roles in movies like \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" and \\"Endless Love,\\" played Jackie's mom in a recurring role during these seasons. Pam Burkhart's character is a somewhat detached, self-absorbed, and absent mother to Jackie, played by Mila Kunis. Throughout the series, it is seen that Jackie's relationship with her mother is rocky and not very supportive. Pam is focused on her appearance and is more of a friend than a mother, which also affects how Jackie behaves and treats others. Pam's character is significant in the show because of the way it shapes Jackie's personality and development. During the time Brooke Shields played the role of Pam Burkhart, her storyline included a divorce from Jackie's millionaire father, Jack Burkhart, and an affair with Steven Hyde's (played by Danny Masterson) father, Bud Hyde (played by Robert Hays). Her return to the show created an interesting dynamic among the characters, especially Jackie and Hyde, who were dating at that time. \\"That '70s Show\\" is a popular American television sitcom that aired from 1998 to 2006.

Analyze if the action in the Tail is necessary for the action in the Head to happen. Does the Tail event need to occur before the Head event can take place? 3. Classify your answer as \\"Yes\\" if the Tail event must happen before the Head event, or \\"No\\" if it doesn't. For the given example: Head: PersonX leaves the food Tail: to receive an urgent call Steps: 1. Identify main actions - leaving the food (Head) and receiving an urgent call (Tail). 2. Analyze if PersonX needs to receive the urgent call before leaving the food. 3. The answer is \\"No\\" since receiving an urgent call does not need to happen before leaving the food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - Silicon Dreams Studio Ltd.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Mindscape Interactive Inc. was an international software publishing company, previously part of The Learning Company and later affiliated with Electronic Arts.

Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - Lego (stylized LEGO) is a line of plastic construction toys that are manufactured by The Lego Group, a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark.

Step 1: Identify the amount being paid and the payment period You mentioned that you're paying 121 per month for another year for your house. This means: Monthly payment: 121 Remaining payment period: 1 year (12 months) Step 2: Calculate the total amount yet to be paid for the house To calculate the total amount to be paid for the remaining period, multiply the monthly payment by the number of months left: Total amount remaining: 121 * 12 months = 1,452 Step 3: Analyze the statement in question Now that we know the total amount yet to be paid, we need to determine whether this amount can be considered as \\"not very high.\\" The interpretation of the statement depends on the context, such as the following factors: - The housing market and average monthly payments in your area - Your personal financial situation and your ability to pay that amount each month - The original purchase price of the house and how much you've paid so far in mortgage Without further information, it's challenging to definitely conclude whether the amount of 121 per month or the remaining total of 1,452 is high or not.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Q: Context: As was discussed in previous concepts, both infectious and noninfectious diseases of the reproductive system can be very serious. But there are ways to keep your reproductive system healthy. What can you do to keep your reproductive system healthy? You can start by making the right choices for overall good health. To be as healthy as you can be, you should: Eat a balanced diet that is high in fiber and low in fat. Drink plenty of water. Get regular exercise. Maintain a healthy weight. Get enough sleep. Avoid using tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs. Manage stress in healthy ways. Keeping your genitals clean is also very important. A daily shower or bath is all that it takes. Females do not need to use special feminine hygiene products. In fact, using them may do more harm than good because they can irritate the vagina or other reproductive structures. You should also avoid other behaviors that can put you at risk. Do not get into contact with another persons blood or other body fluids. For example, never get a tattoo or piercing unless you are sure that the needles have not been used before. This is one of the most important ways to prevent an STI. Of course, the only way to be fully protected against STIs is to refrain from sexual activity. If you are a boy, you should always wear a protective cup when you play contact sports. Contact sports include football, boxing, and hockey. Wearing a cup will help protect the testes from injury. You should also do a monthly self-exam to check for cancer of the testes. If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every four to six hours. Leaving tampons in for too long can put you at risk of toxic shock syndrome. This is a serious condition. Signs and symptoms of toxic shock syndrome develop suddenly, and the disease can be fatal. The disease involves fever, shock, and problems with the function of several body organs. Girls should also get in the habit of doing a monthly self-exam to check for breast cancer. Although breast cancer is rare in teens, its a good idea to start doing the exam when you are young. It will help you get to know what is normal for you.   Question: girls should perform monthly self-exams to check for A:","output":"breast cancer"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's a pscyho-sexual thriller, in which nothing is what it seems. It features Emmanuelle Seigner, no stranger to the genre (and to nudity) in which her husband, Polanski, had directed her. And a creepy performance (did I say creepy/yes CREEPY) from Toreton (Bernard Tavernier's actor). It looks like a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), like a Chabrol gone astray or Clouzot thriller (I have seen someone mentioning Les Diaboliques), but closer to Georges Franju's Les Yeux sans Visage (Eyes without a face, the godfather of Dr. Phibes and more).

The reviewer also draws comparisons to the works of other notable filmmakers like Pascal Bruckner, Roman Polanski, Chabrol, Clouzot, and Franju, which is generally perceived as a compliment. By stating that the film is a \\"gem,\\" the reviewer expresses their admiration for it, implying it's a rare and valuable piece of cinema. They conclude the review by expressing their concern that the movie might be turned into a Hollywood remake, something they believe would be detrimental to its unique qualities.

It has been claimed that Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis had a long-running personal vendetta against Channel 7 and in particular their Sunrise program. Monis spent six years lobbying the Australian media watchdog over what he perceived were breaches of broadcasting regulations involving Sunrise news segments. The hostage-taker died along with two of the 17 hostages he took in the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place just metres from Channel 7's Sunrise studio last week. The attack took place so near 7's offices it prompted speculation the Sunrise studio was his target from the very beginning, but that his initial plans went awry. Fairfax revealed that the 50-year-old first complained in mid-2007 to the ACMA about a Sunrise program broadcast on July 4 of that year. In later ranting letters to other authorities about the","output":"matter, Monis claimed that the Sunrise program had deliberately manipulated the news and had shown a biased perspective in their coverage of certain events. He felt that the program was ignoring his concerns and continuously engaging in deceptive reporting practices. Monis also accused the show's producers and hosts of mocking him and dismissing any valid points he raised. His relentless pursuit of action against Channel 7 and the Sunrise team led to multiple failed attempts to bring legal claims against the broadcaster. The Australian media watchdog, ACMA, reviewed his complaints on several occasions, ultimately finding no wrongdoings on the part of the Sunrise program or its staff. Over the years, Monis continued to express his frustration with the show, even resorting to social media to voice his complaints. It became increasingly evident that his vendetta against Channel 7's Sunrise program had evolved into a deeply personal issue, bordering on obsession. With the Sydney siege as a terrifying culmination of his grievances against the program, it is undeniable that Man Haron Monis had a deep-rooted grudge towards Channel 7 and the Sunrise team. While the exact reasoning behind his actions remains a subject of debate, one thing is clear: the Lindt Cafe attack has cast a dark cloud over the station and those involved in the Sunrise program, forever staining the memory of that tragic day. It is crucial for media outlets to continue reporting on events as accurately and fairly as possible, while also being sensitive to the reactions of their audience. While it is still uncertain whether the Sydney siege had a direct correlation with the gunman's grievances against Channel 7 and Sunrise, the incident serves as a poignant reminder for the responsibility that media holds in shaping perceptions and public opinion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cake was formed in 1991 when John McCrea, a Sacramento, California native who had moved to Los Angeles with a band only to see it \\"quickly crumble around him\\", returned to Sacramento. He began looking for a new band to play with, having \\"grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit\\", and quickly attracted trumpet player Vince DiFiore, guitarist Greg Brown, bassist Shon Meckfessel and drummer Frank French. All were active in the music scene at the time; DiFiore notes that \\"[McCrea] came back and stole us from other bands\\". The band soon came up with the name \\"Cake\\"; rather than referring to the foodstuff, the name is meant to be \\"like when something insidiously becomes a part of your life...[we] mean it more as something that cakes onto your shoe and is just sort of there until you get rid of it\\". Meckfessel soon left to attend college, and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. After touring and becoming part of the club scene in San Francisco, the band independently recorded and released Motorcade of Generosity in 1994, selling copies from their van as a method of paying touring expenses.  Motorcade was named one of the best indie releases of 1994 by Pulse!, and after a concert at the Great American Music Hall Bonnie Simmons agreed to manage the band, leading to them signing a deal with Capricorn Records, who re-released the album in 1995. The first single, Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle, hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes. Critical reactions to the album were largely positive; Stephen Thompson in the Wisconsin State Journal described it as possessing \\"great lyrics, creative instrumentation and production that's about as simple as production gets\\", Thomas Conner praised it for being \\"soulful and smooth, witty and gritty, this record makes the ghosts of Bob Wills, Buddy Holly and Lou Reed smile\\" in the Tulsa World, and Matt Weitz in the Dallas Observer noted its \\"gimlet eye and sardonic humor\\". The album was eventually nominated for a Bammy Award in the category of \\"Outstanding Debut Album\\".  Nevertheless, some critics were less appreciative; John Wirt, in The Advocate, praised the album's sense of humor and \\"delicious\\" irreverence but noted that \\"[the] musicianship in Motorcade of Generosity suggests the Cake guys are mediocre players\\". Mindy LaBernz, in The Austin Chronicle, described the album as \\"cover-free, and, since we're on the subject, genre-free. A quartet made five by a trumpet player, Cake carry themselves with the snittiness of technically proficient, lyrically aware music lovers, who are almost anachronistically untrendy and brazenly proud of it\\". The signing to Capricorn and re-release of Motorcade led to both French and Nelson leaving the band, citing their dislike of \\"the prospect of extensive national touring\\"; they were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani respectively.  Fashion Nugget, Cake's second album, was released on September 17, 1996. Like Motorcade, it was produced by the band and released on Capricorn Records. Cake considered the album more professionally produced than Motorcade, despite references to its \\"raw\\" sound, and the reception was again generally positive; critics noted the broadening of Cake's sound, with Joshua Green noting in the Westword that \\"Nugget spans a broader range of topics than did Motorcade, with similarly appealing results\\", and Matt Weitz in the Dallas Observer saying that \\"The gimlet eye and sardonic humor of 1994's Motorcade of Generosity is intact, but Fashion Nugget is aptly named; it updates Motorcade with beatboxy soul and hip-hop rhythms\\". The album's first single, \\"The Distance\\", written by Greg Brown, became the band's biggest hit to date and is considered their \\"ubiquitous\\" song; it hit number 5 on the RPM Alternative 30, and entered the Modern Rock Tracks top 5.  On the strength of \\"The Distance\\", Fashion Nugget was certified gold on December 9, 1996 and platinum on April 10, 1997. The second single from Fashion Nugget, a cover of the Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris song \\"I Will Survive\\", hit number 38 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. Although the band described it as a serious take on the original, one they'd been playing live for years, original performer Gloria Gaynor considers it her least favorite version of the song due to its use of profanity. Following Fashion Nugget's release, the band toured the United States, playing in cities including Tulsa, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Dallas. They later toured overseas, visiting the United Kingdom as a support act for Counting Crows, playing their own shows alongside the tour at venues including Dingwalls in London. The band also toured Japan; a later tour of the US, starting in Minneapolis in June 1997, was cancelled due to illness when McCrea was diagnosed with \\"fatigue and extreme exhaustion\\". After McCrea recovered, the band continued touring, playing at the Big Stink festival in Vancouver, Washington, and the Jayhawk Music Festival in Lawrence, Kansas.  1997 also saw lineup changes; bassist Victor Damiani and guitarist Greg Brown both left, prompting speculation about the band's survival; McCrea noted that \\"Musically, there was a really great symbiosis and I really felt that it (their departures, especially Brown's) was the most stupid thing in the world\\", and said that he had considered dissolving the band. Brown and Damiani formed the \\"new-wave influenced\\" Deathray; their places within Cake were taken by Xan McCurdy and Gabe Nelson, whom McCrea persuaded to rejoin the band.  For their fourth album, Comfort Eagle, the band signed a deal with Columbia Records. Comfort Eagle was both produced and arranged by the band, and was recorded at Paradise Studios in Sacramento and Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco. Following the recording, drummer Todd Roper left the band, citing the demands extended touring would put on his time, and the commitments his two children, Griffin and Bella, represented. He was replaced by Pete McNeal. The album's release was preceded by the release of its first single, \\"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\\", described as a parable about \\"the relationship between prosperity and the population boom ... There's nothing more procreational than economic prosperity\\". An accompanying video was directed by McCrea, and recorded using the DV system; it featured vox populi recordings of members of the public listening to the song and giving their opinion. \\"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\\" hit number 2 on the Bear Rock Top 10 in Canada and number 7 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks; the video became one of the 30 most requested tracks on MTV; Billboard writers later listed the video as the 5th best of 2001.  Comfort Eagle itself was released on July 24, 2001, to good reviews; Michael D. Clark of The Houston Chronicle described it as \\"Cake at its best\\", while a reviewer for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution stated that the album's songs were \\"among the best of the band's career\\", praising McCrea for widening his vocal repertoire. James Montgomery, writing for UWIRE, noted a stylistic change, saying that \\"While the core sound of the band - honky tonk guitars, mariachi horns and salsa rhythms - remain intact, they have been stripped down to the core, replaced instead with ill Casio beats, rubbery funk and Stax-style horn bleats\\". The album sold 22,000 copies in its first week, the highest sales in the band's history, and eventually went gold. With the exception of a slot at the Atlanta On The Bricks Festival, playing for 90,000 people, the band chose to start the tour with small rather than large shows, such as in the Sacramento area, where they played for around 100 people. They launched their first full tour for the album in September, playing in the United States, Canada and across Europe.  A second single, \\"Love You Madly\\", was released in 2002, with an accompanying video again produced by McCrea. The video featured DiFiore and McNeal competing in a cooking competition, judged by Rick James, Phyllis Diller and Jeff Smith, and was noted by Billboard as \\"continuing the fresh, witty, and downright fun style seen in the \\"Short Skirt\\" video\\". Cake had planned a second tour of Europe, followed by a series of shows around the United States, but in view of the September 11 attacks chose not to travel overseas. Instead, the band streamed a performance internationally from the Yahoo! headquarters in California, playing emailed requests. The United States tour went ahead as planned, with Cake playing concerts in Birmingham, Alabama, St. Petersburg, Florida, Salt Lake City, and Las Vegas. This was followed by the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, a traveling festival headlined and planned by the band and featuring Modest Mouse, De La Soul and The Flaming Lips. A second Unlimited Sunshine Tour was undertaken in 2003, featuring Cake, Cheap Trick and The Hackensaw Boys.

(Associated Press)      8:00 p.m. (6:00 p.m. GMT)      President Obama has telephoned USAF Airman First Class Spencer Stone, Army National Guard Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler to commend and congratulate them for their courage and quick action aboard their Paris-bound train last night. Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Obama expressed gratitude to the trio for their heroic actions forestalling an even greater tragedy. Obama wished Stone a full and speedy recovery, and expressed how proud all Americans are of their extraordinary bravery.      ___      7:40 p.m. (5:40 p.m. GMT)      Spencer Stone, widely acclaimed as an American hero for his aggressive role in taking down the train gunman, was seen Saturday leaving a hospital in Lille where he was treated for a hand injury. He walked out, waved quickly and slipped into a black sedan with diplomatic license plates. It was not immediately clear where he was headed.      Stone, who is in the Air Force, was also commended for helping an injured train passenger, a French-American, bleeding from a gunshot wound. That passenger, a teacher who resides outside Paris, was being treated in another hospital in Lille.      French President Francois Hollande said in a statement that he spoke with President Barack Obama to personally thank him for the \\"exemplary conduct of American citizens who stopped an extremely serious attack.\\"      ____      5:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. GMT)      Chris Norman, a British businessman who helped three Americans to subdue the train gunman, said he was working on his computer when he heard a shot and glass breaking.      He said his first reaction was to hide. \\"Then I heard one guy, an American, say 'go get him,' and another American say 'Don't you do that buddy.'\\"      Norman was the fourth to join in subduing the gunman.      Norman told reporters: \\"He had a Kalashnikov, he had a magazine full, I don't know how many magazines he had. My thought was, OK, probably I'm going to die anyway. So, let's go. I'd rather die being active.\\"      Norman, who was returning from a business trip in the Netherlands to his home in southern France, said the gunman was small and not visibly strong but \\"he put up quite a bit of a fight.\\"      ___      3:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. GMT)      The Belgian government has stepped up rail security after a gunman who boarded a Thalys train in Brussels was subdued by passengers on the Paris-bound service.      After a meeting of the country's national security council Saturday, Prime Minister Charles Michel's office announced that mixed Franco-Belgian security patrols would be beefed up on the high-speed Thalys trains, which link major cities in the Netherlands and Belgium to Paris. Patrols and security checks will also be boosted at international rail stations, and more baggage checks will now be carried out.

He said, \\"We heard passengers shouting in English, 'He's firing, he's firing. He has a Kalashnikov.'\\" He said he saw train personnel running down the corridor to take refuge in their work car, and claimed they locked the door and refused to answer desperate knocks.      Then Anthony Sadler, one of the three Americans traveling together, came into their car and said the gunman had been subdued.      \\"We were in a bad spot but with good people,\\" Anglade said. \\"We were incredibly lucky to have American soldiers with us.

Two officials at the hospital in the northern French city of Arras where Stone was initially treated said he was transferred Saturday to a larger hospital in Lille. They did not provide a reason for the move.      Stone's traveling companions say he intervened to immobilize the suspect, and the gunman stabbed Stone with a box-cutter.

As Sadler, Skarlatos, and a fourth passenger, Chris Norman, jumped in to hold him down, the attacker pulled out a box cutter and slashed Stone, Sadler said.      Stone's finger was nearly severed, according to his family.      \\"I just wish he [Stone] didn’t have to get hurt, but they saved lives,\\" Stone’s mother, Joyce Eskel, told ABC affiliate KXTV-TV in Sacramento, California.

Obama also wished Stone a \\"full and speedy recovery, and expressed how proud all Americans are of their extraordinary bravery,\\" said Schultz.      Norman said Saturday he was acting purely on survival instincts when he jumped in to help hold the attacker down.      \\"My thought was I'm probably going to die anyway, so let's go,\\" he said. \\"I'd rather die being active ... than simply sit in the corner and be shot.\\"      Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images      The attacker was taken into custody as the train was stopped in Arras, France, about two hours northeast of Paris. He was being interviewed by French counter-terrorism officials Saturday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.      Cazeneuve said did not release the suspect's name, but said that if he is the man he says he is, then he is a 26-year-old Moroccan who Spanish authorities say is a member of the radical Islamist movement.      A spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor said the man arrested was identified as Ayoub El Khazani. Belgian authorities were investigating where he lived and where he got the weapons, the spokesman said.      According to Cazeneuve, the suspect was armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a 9mm automatic pistol and a box cutter.      A French actor, Jean-Hugues Anglade, suffered non-life threatening injuries in the attack, said Cazeneuve, who also thanked the Americans for their courage and cool nerves.

Most people would think that aside from comets  and stars, there is little else out there. But, since our space journey started we have left so much trash  there that scientists are now concerned that if we don't clean it up, we may all be in mortal  danger. The first piece of space junk was created in 1964, when the American satellite Vanguard I stopped operating and lost its connection with the ground center. However, since it kept orbiting around the Earth without any consequences, scientists became increasingly comfortable abandoning  things that no longer served any useful purpose in space. It is estimated  that there are now over 500,000 pieces of man-made trash orbiting the Earth at speeds of up to 17,500 miles per hour. The junk varies from tiny pieces of paint chipped off rockets to cameras, huge fuel tanks, and even odd items like the million-dollar tool kit that astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn Piper lost during a spacewalk. The major problem with the space trash is that it may hit working satellites and damage traveling spacecraft . Moreover, pieces of junk may collide  with each other and break into pieces which fall back to the Earth. To avoid this, scientists have invented several ways for clearing the sky. Ground stations have been built to monitor larger pieces of space trash to prevent them from crashing into working satellites or space shuttles. Future plans include a cooperative effort among many nations to stop littering in space and to clean up the trash already there. Options: A A camera. B A tool kit. C A fuel tank.

With a 38-35 victory over the New York Giants at Giants Stadium Saturday night, the New England Patriots became the second team in the modern era of the National Football League to go undefeated (16-0) in the regular season. The only other team to have achieved this feat was the Miami Dolphins in 1972, who were 14-0 due to a different regular season structure at the time. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Patriots and the Dolphins played the same number of games.  Available choices: a). Yes. b). It's impossible to say. c). No.","output":"c). No. Although both the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins achieved an undefeated regular season, they did not play the same number of games during those respective seasons. The reason for this difference lies in the regular season structure at the time each team achieved their flawless records. In 1972, the NFL regular season was comprised of 14 games, allowing the Miami Dolphins to achieve a 14-0 perfect record. During that time, the NFL was divided into three divisions within each conference (AFC and NFC), with the regular season concluding with a four-team playoff structure. However, by the time the New England Patriots achieved their undefeated regular season in 2007, the NFL had undergone significant changes in its structure. The league had expanded to include 32 teams and divided them into four divisions within each conference (AFC and NFC). Consequently, the length of the regular season was extended from 14 games to the current 16 games, which allowed the Patriots to reach a 16-0 perfect record. Therefore, while both teams managed to go undefeated in their respective regular seasons, they did not play the same number of games due to the difference in regular season structure at the time of their achievements. The Miami Dolphins achieved their perfect season with a 14-0 record in 1972, while the New England Patriots attained their 16-0 record in 2007."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: How do I find the factor of the number? Second question: What is a simple formula to calculate the sum of the prime factors of a number? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPTIONS: (1). no (2). yes","output":"Option 1: No These two questions are asking about different things.  For the first question, finding the factor of a number means identifying all numbers that can evenly divide into the said number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1,2,3,6 because these numbers divide evenly into 6. The process of finding factors by AI would be to divide the given number by all numbers less than or equal to its square root and checking if the remainder is zero. If the remainder is zero, then both the divisor and the quotient are factors. For the second question, a prime factor is a factor that is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself. For example, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. To calculate the sum of the prime factors, you add these prime factors together. For example, the sum of the prime factors of 6 is 2 + 3 = 5. The process to find the sum of prime factors by AI would involve firstly finding all prime factors. The easiest way to do this is by iteratively dividing the number by the smallest prime (2) and continue this process with the quotient until it is not divisible anymore, then go to the next smallest prime. Repeat these steps until all that remains is a prime number, that’s the last prime factor. After finding all the prime factors, simply add them together. So, the first question deals with finding all factors (not necessarily prime) of a number and the second question deals with finding only the prime factors of a number and furthermore calculating their sum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum.  Which area is less likely to have acid rain? Answer:","output":"To determine which area is less likely to have acid rain, I will compare the factors contributing to acid rain in Beijing and Montreal. Step 1: Understand the primary causes of acid rain Acid rain is primarily caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These pollutants react with water, oxygen, and other substances in the air to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which then fall to the ground as acid rain. Step 2: Evaluate the scenario in Beijing Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants. Coal-fired power plants are significant sources of SO2 and NOx emissions. These pollutants contribute to Beijing's high potential for acid rain. Step 3: Evaluate the scenario in Montreal In Montreal, manufacturing plants have significantly reduced their SO2 emissions after a recent referendum. Lower SO2 emissions mean a reduced likelihood of acid rain in the area. Step 4: Compare the two scenarios Beijing has recently increased its potential for acid rain with the opening of new coal-fired power plants, while Montreal has reduced its potential for acid rain due to lower SO2 emissions from manufacturing plants. Answer: Based on the provided information, Montreal is less likely to have acid rain compared to Beijing, since Montreal has reduced its sulfur oxides emissions, and Beijing has recently added coal-fired power plants which increase its sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions, both of which contribute to acid rain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film, released in 1965, follows the unexpected adventure of a small midwestern town that is suddenly invaded by the aforementioned Alien Spacelings – and their intergalactic escapade subsequently leaves a trail of havoc on the human population. Directed by the ingenious Roger Starbeam, “Invasion of the Alien Spacelings” turns its low-budget limitations into distinctive creative strengths. Starbeam maximizes the movie's limited resources by employing crafty camera angles and takes full advantage of the colorful set design, which boasts an eclectic mix of pulpy retro-futuristic main street Americana. The plastic flying saucers, visibly dangling from thin fishing wires, perfectly encapsulate the delightful campiness that the film proudly flaunts. One of the major highlights of the film is its eccentric characters. The protagonist, Sheriff Hawkins (played by the charismatic Johnny Ravework), is a multilayered and complex individual. He's a young, battle-ready Vietnam War vet that aptly embraces the role of a local town hero in the wake of the alien invasion. Opposite Hawkins is the enigmatic and feisty Astrid (played by the equally magnetic Judy Stardrop), a brilliant scientist who comes to the rescue by deciphering the aliens' encrypted communication signals. Their undeniable on-screen chemistry serves as a strong emotional pillar throughout the narrative. The Alien Spacelings themselves are an interesting blend of imaginativeness and camp. Although their costumes are clearly nothing more than repurposed wetsuits discreetly covered with green and blue paint, the actors' enthusiastic efforts to portray these unhinged creatures add an undeniably refreshing and infectious energy to the film. These cosmic beings have traveled millions of light-years with only one goal in mind: to consume all the sugar available on Earth, as this sweet substance is crucial to the survival and evolution of their species. The plot of “Invasion of the Alien Spacelings” takes wild twists and turns, providing non-stop entertainment to the audience. In one memorable scene, the town's beloved baker, Granny Willows, triumphs over an Alien Spaceling with her powerful rolling pin. It's hilarious, campy moments like these that elevate the movie to new heights of B-movie glory. Moreover, the film's oddly infectious musical score, composed by Murray Synchroflux, ties the story together. An electrifying mix of theremin-infused orchestral themes and bopping jazz numbers creates an amusing, otherworldly auditory experience that leaves moviegoers tapping their feet in delight. In conclusion, “Invasion of the Alien Spacelings” is an outstanding, somewhat overlooked film that celebrates the creativity and originality of B-movies in the science fiction genre. With its iconic characters, cheesy special effects, and unforgettable twists, the film captures the essence of a thrilling adventure while never taking itself too seriously. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable ride into the unknown that leaves fans of vintage sci-fi clamoring for more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg was third as team-mate Lewis Hamilton suffered suspension failure and took fourth. Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen took fifth but was disqualified for a technical infringement and starts from the back. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, battling to keep second in the championship, was 11th, out of the top 10 for the first time this year. Media playback is not supported on this device The Spaniard was beaten by team-mate Felipe Massa for the fifth time in six races and the eighth occasion in 17 grands prix this season. The Brazilian was eighth quickest in the top 10 shoot-out, behind Raikkonen, who has been allowed to start from the back after his car failed a front-floor deflection test, Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Lotus's Romain Grosjean. McLaren's Sergio Perez and Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo completed the top 10, while Force India's Paul Di Resta was 12th, just behind Alonso. Ferrari have been struggling with a lack of traction but Alonso was 0.104secs adrift of Massa in second qualifying, doing little to quieten questions about his form in qualifying in the second half of this season. His erstwhile title rival Vettel will be just as disappointed with second place. The 26-year-old was fastest after the first laps in the top 10 shoot-out but after Webber pipped him on the Australian's final run, Vettel failed to improve. Vettel flicked his head in frustration several times as he crossed the line after completing his final lap. Webber said: \\"This weekend has gone pretty smoothly. Not the smoothest path to the start of Q2 or Q1, we were not electric. We changed the car quite a bit and I got more and more comfortable as the session went on. It made me more comfortable in the final sector, where Seb has been quick, so I was able to match him there and keep where I had been quick already.\\" Vettel said he made a mistake in Turn One. \\"I was pushing hard, that's the reason behind it,\\" he said. \\"You can always say there is a bit here and there, but if you push to the maximum and try to get everything out you can do mistakes.

Hamilton said over the radio that he felt something had broken on the car and the team later discovered that the right rear suspension wishbone had broken. Team principal Ross Brawn said: \\"It's a fast left-hander and he got the car fully on the kerb. We need to analyse what happened because it's a part we have run all year, but I don't think there are any risks for the race.\\" Hamilton was half a second up on his previous best lap when the incident happened, with his favourite sector three to come. He ended qualifying 0.544secs off Webber's pole time. Hamilton said he was hopeful he could compete with the Red Bulls for his first victory since the Hungarian Grand Prix at the end of July. \\"The car has been feeling great this weekend,\\" he said. \\"We have closed the gap a little bit. I don't know why all of a sudden they have come back so far. I think we have a good chance to fight for a win.\\" Full qualifying results for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix","output":"In the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Webber outperformed Vettel by 0.1 seconds, securing the top position. Rosberg came in third, while Hamilton, who experienced suspension failure, took fourth place. Raikkonen initially placed fifth but was disqualified for a technical infringement and moved to the back. Alonso finished 11th, outside of the top 10 for the first time this year. Massa outpaced Alonso for the fifth time in six races, claiming the eighth position. The top 10 finishers included Hulkenberg, Grosjean, Perez, and Ricciardo. Alonso's ranking behind Massa raised questions about his form during the second half of the season. Despite Vettel's second-place finish, he and Webber continued to express their confidence and determination. Hamilton remains hopeful of competing with the Red Bulls for a win."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"All Russian athletes to be banned from Paralympic Games in Rio\\"","output":"Title: All Russian athletes to be banned from Paralympic Games in Rio Introduction In a shocking turn of events that has sent waves of disappointment and disbelief throughout the international sports community, it has been announced that all Russian athletes will be banned from participating in the upcoming Paralympic Games in Rio. This decision has been reached following a series of investigations and findings that pointed to systematic, state-sponsored doping within the Russian sports system. Background The journey that led us to this point has been both tumultuous and difficult for all parties involved. Starting with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games, there were widespread allegations of doping within the Russian sports system. These allegations prompted further investigations led by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which eventually led to the publication of the McLaren report. The McLaren report, released in July 2016, presented evidence of a widespread state-sponsored doping program within Russia. The investigation, carried out by Canadian lawyer and WADA investigator Richard McLaren, discovered several instances of cheating and deception within the Russian system. Among these instances were the swapping of urine samples to avoid positive tests, manipulation of doping test results, and the involvement of the Russian government in facilitating these activities. Decision-making process After the McLaren report, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) was left with a difficult decision. With the evidence laid out in front of them, the IPC had to come to terms with the fact that the Russian sports system had been systematically cheating the international sports community. In light of these findings, the IPC called for a complete ban of Russian Paralympic athletes from the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio. The IPC's decision was not made overnight. It took several rounds of debates and discussions before they finally reached a consensus. Amidst growing tensions and the stakes constantly rising, it was a decision that would change the course of the Paralympic Games forever. In the end, the IPC resolved to uphold and protect the integrity of the Paralympic movement, even if it meant excluding an entire nation from the competition. Support and backlash As expected, the IPC's decision to ban Russian athletes from the Paralympic Games was met with mixed reactions from various stakeholders within the international sports community. For some, the decision was applauded as a necessary step towards ensuring a fair and level playing field for athletes from around the world. The ban was seen as a clear message that no nation will be allowed to corrupt the Paralympic movement through cheating and deception. On the other hand, there were those who criticized the IPC's ruling as being overly strict and unjust. Russian sports authorities and government officials have consistently denied any involvement in the alleged state-sponsored doping program. They have decried the wholesale ban as collective punishment, claiming that innocent athletes will be unjustly denied the opportunity to compete on the biggest stage of their careers. Impact on the Paralympic Games and beyond The banning of all Russian athletes from the Rio Paralympic Games certainly taints the event with an undeniable air of controversy. The absence of Russian athletes will undoubtedly reshape the competitive landscape in Rio, opening up opportunities for other nations to claim medals that would otherwise have been contested by Russian Paralympians. However, the ban does not only affect the upcoming Paralympic Games but has far-reaching implications for the future of sports in Russia and the international sports community as a whole. The entire saga has highlighted the urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of global anti-doping practices, as well as more robust systems for ensuring transparency and accountability among sports officials. Conclusion The banning of all Russian athletes from the Paralympic Games in Rio is a potent reminder of the importance of protecting the integrity of sports. While opinions remain divided about the fairness and severity of the ban, it is clear that the Paralympic movement, as well as the greater international sports community, must remain vigilant and take decisive action to root out doping and its corrosive effects on the spirit of fair competition. Only by doing so can we ensure a more just and equitable playing field for all athletes, regardless of their nationalities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Title: Phantasm II Movie plot: Picking up where the first movie left off, the Tall Man and his minions attempt to take Mike (James LeGros), but Reggie (Reggie Bannister) manages to save him after turning on the gas while the fireplace was on, blowing up the house.Six years later, the film introduces Liz Reynolds (Paula Irvine), a young woman with a psychic bond to Mike Pearson and the Tall Man that manifests in the form of prophetic nightmares. After she awakens from one, she looks at her dream journal, which includes drawings detailing characters and events from the first film; during this, she recalls a vision that picks up immediately where the first film ended: after the Tall Man's minions attacked Mike through his bedroom mirror, Reggie heard the commotion and ran upstairs to his aid. He tried to get a shotgun, but was attacked by Lurkers and had to flee, although he managed to surreptitiously snuff the pilot lights on the stove. Once upstairs, he dodged the Tall Man and rescued Mike, and the two dove out of the bedroom window to escape as the gas fumes reached the living room fireplace and destroyed the house. Following this, Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him.Having been institutionalized as delusional since the first film, Mike feels he can no longer ignore Liz's dream pleas, and fakes his recovery to obtain a doctor's release. At night, he returns to Morningside Cemetery to exhume bodies and is interrupted by Reggie who tells him that the attack at the beginning of the film never occurred. Mike reveals that the coffins he dug up are empty and urges Reggie to help him hunt the Tall Man down. En route to Reggie's house, Mike receives a vision of an impending gas explosion, and frantically tries to warn Reggie seconds before his house is consumed in an explosion, killing his wife Celeste, daughter Bonnie, and Aunt Marta.

In Syria, the opposition is not waiting for President Bashar al-Assad to fall.      Anti-government activists in recent weeks have used a Google crowdsourcing program, Map Maker, to rename key streets, bridges and boulevards after their revolutionary heroes, according to opposition figures and the Syrian government. The idea, activists say, has been to expunge the vestiges of the Assad family’s 40-year rule and to commemorate protesters who have fallen over the course of an 11-month-old uprising.      “They have the right to be remembered by the Syrians,” said Rwadan Ziadeh, a representative of the Syrian National Council, an exile group. “They are making new history.”      On Google, names have changed over time as the maps are updated with user proposals, which are approved by other users as well as Google editors. The names on Google Maps are sometimes different from those on Google Earth. The overall result, however, has been a patchwork of Assad-era and revolutionary names, sometimes side by side.      (GOOGLE EARTH IMAGE from JANUARY PROVIDED BY ogleearth.com/Last month, this major Damascus highway was identified on Google Earth as being named after Hafez al-Assad, the father of Syria’s current president, and Ibrahim al-Kashosh, an icon of the current uprising. )      The campaign started a couple of months ago on Facebook, said Rami Nakhle, another exile opposition figure, and it has quickly gained the Syrian government’s attention. On Monday, the country’s envoy to the United Nations, Bashar al-Jafaari, digressed from a speech before the General Assembly to accuse Google of participating in a foreign plot to meddle in Syria’s internal affairs and undermine its leader.      “What does Google have to do with the names of streets in small Syrian cities and villages?” Jafaari said, referring to changed street names in the restive towns of Homs and Idlib. “This is a flagrant violation of United Nations General Assembly, the resolution of the Arab League pertaining to the standardization of the geographic nomenclature.”      The renaming campaign hasn’t happened only online. On Syrian streets, members of the opposition have changed signs with their own hands.      Ziadeh said activists in his home town, Daraya, tore down the sign on a street named after President Assad’s older brother, Basel al-Assad, who died in a car accident in 1994. In its place, they erected a sign honoring Ghiyath Matar, a 24-year-old tailor whose signature gesture — handing out flowers to Syrian soldiers — has come to symbolize the opposition movement’s nonviolent beginnings.      Anti-government activists throughout the Middle East have effectively harnessed the power of the Internet, particularly social media, to fuel public support for their causes. Google, which employed Wael Ghonim, an early leader of the popular uprising that brought down Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, has emerged as a particularly high-profile symbol of the forces of tumult.      The Internet giant declined to make someone available to discuss its mapping practices in detail. But spokeswoman Deanna Yick said Google has built its maps from “a wide range of authoritative sources, ranging from the public and commercial data providers, user contributions and imagery references.      “Overall,” Yick said, “this provides a very comprehensive and up-to-date map, but maps are constantly changing along with the real world, so we’ll continue to review data and make changes as new information becomes available.”      The effort to exploit the Internet has in some ways been more critical in Syria, where the government has imposed a tighter media blackout, than in other countries that have undergone upheaval during the Arab Spring. Protesters have hacked government Web sites, smuggled cellphone images outside the country showing evidence of the government crackdown, and run live streams from towns including Homs, where the United Nations asserts that more than 300 people have been killed in the past two weeks.      Stefan Geens, author of the Ogle Earth blog, which tracks Google Maps, said the renaming of Syrian streets and other landmarks represents the latest front in efforts to use crowdsourcing to promote political views.      In 2008, he said, Tunisian activists using Google Earth posted links to a YouTube video on top of the view of the presidential palace in Tunis. The video featured former political prisoners describing torture they suffered under the government.      But Geens said Syria’s is the first uprising he knows of in which activists have used online mapping programs to rewrite history.      He compared a Google map of the town of Latakia with a crowdsourced map produced by OpenStreetMap. Both showed 8 March Avenue, named for the date of the 1963 military coup that brought the Baath Party to power and installed Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad’s father, as president. But the Google map also carried the date March 15, an apparent reference to the official birth of the 2011 popular uprising in Syria.      “It’s obvious this was crowdsourced. This is the risk of crowdsourcing: One could infiltrate and change names for political purposes,” Geens said. “I am absolutely convinced that this is not something intentional on Google’s part to subvert the authority of Assad.”      The Syrian government might not be convinced. The U.N. diplomatic protest came several weeks after Damas Post, a Syrian government Web site, noted that a major Damascus highway was identified on Google Earth as being named after both Hafez al-Assad and Ibrahim al-Kashosh, another icon of the current uprising.      On Tuesday morning, Assad’s name was nowhere to be seen. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain.

The force said he would not be able to take off the handcuffs by himself. Det Supt Mick Orr said: \\"Anybody offering this man help to remove the handcuffs could be leaving themselves open to prosecution.\\" The police helicopter helped officers on the ground scour the area after the suspect made off at about 11:00 BST on Saturday. Police said Mr Rogers, who has links to Chigwell as well as Waltham Abbey, was wearing handcuffs and grey shorts, a polo top, purple socks, white trainers and has short brown hair.

News article: Women allegedly held as slaves for 30 years in south London originally met their captors in a “collective” after meeting them through a “shared political ideology”, police have disclosed.      Commander Steve Rodhouse, of Scotland Yard, also revealed the couple accused of holding the three women against their will were of Indian and Tanzanian origin, and came to live in Britain in the 1960s.      The address where the women lived with their alleged captors has been revealed as a tidy three-storey council block in Peckford Place, Stockwell, south London.      One neighbour said the elderly couple who lived at the address appeared to be \\"dominant\\" over the other occupants.      It emerged earlier this week that the three victims - a 69 year-old Malaysian, a 57 year-old Irish woman and a British woman aged 30 - were rescued from the property last month and had been subjected to what police described as “emotional control” for decades.      Neighbours expressed their shock and surprise at the drama which had unfolded in recent days at the flat on the Angel Town estate.      One man said he had seen a woman in her 30s, who appeared to be of Indian origin, entering the house on two occasions in recent months.      \\"She looked completely normal. She was wearing a headscarf and just went into the flat on the times I saw her,\\" said Jose Pereira, 54, a cook.      One resident, who did not want to be named, described the occupants as an elderly Indian couple, a woman in her 30s and another woman of Indian appearance in her mid-50s.      He said: \\"I thought the elderly couple were looking after the others, as if they were carers, but there was something strange about it all.      \\"The older couple were definitely the ones in charge, they were the dominant ones, you could tell that.      \\"The young girl was very quiet and would not say very much. She was very pretty. I have to say the older couple were very polite.\\"      Another resident, who would only give her name as Sophie, described how she spotted one of the women being pushed in a wheelchair by another of the occupants of the house three weeks ago.      Mr Rodhouse said officers were beginning house-to-house inquiries nearby in a bid to learn more about the extraordinary incident.      Mr Rodhouse said: “The suspects are of Indian and Tanzanian origin that came to the UK in the 1960s.      “We believe that two of the victims met the male suspect in London through a shared political ideology, and that they lived together at an address that you could effectively call a ‘collective’.      “Somehow that collective came to an end and how the women ended up continuing to live with the suspects.      “How this resulted in the women living in this way for over 30 years is what are seeking to establish, but we believe emotional and physical abuse has been a feature of all the victims’ lives.      “The people involved, the nature of that collective and how it operated is all subject to our investigation and we are slowly and painstakingly piecing together more information. I will not give any further information about it.”      Mr Rodhouse revealed the younger of the three victims had a birth certificate but added: “That is all the official documentation we can find.”      Officers believe the 30 year-old woman has lived with the suspects and the other victims all her life.      The rescue was staged after the 57 year-old woman secretly gained access to a telephone and contacted Freedom Charity, which works with victims of enforced labour.      She first contacted them on 18 October and following negotiations over a week, the three women left the property on October 25 when the occupants of the house were out.      They were moved to a safe location where they have been receiving specialist help. It is not yet known if they are related.      On Thursday the alleged captors, both aged 67, were arrested and questioned but have since been released on bail until January.      Mr Rodhouse said no-one had reported the three victims missing to police between they day they left the house and the day of the arrests.      He added: “I understand the huge public interest in this case, the desire for information and the shock that it has caused.      “However, we must take every step to protect the identities of the victims who are understandably emotionally fragile and highly vulnerable.      “For that reason will not provide any information that will lead to the identification of the suspects or these women that require our every effort to protect them.”      A Aneeta Prem of Freedom Charity      Earlier, police said the women had been \\"brainwashed\\" because of the fear instilled in them by their captors, and were held by \\"invisible handcuffs\\".      At the Angel Town estate Sara Habtemichael, 41, a mother-of-three, said: \\"It's so very sad what seems to have happened there.      \\"Can you imagine what was going on? I've lived here for five years and never really noticed the people who lived at that address.      \\"When I first heard about it on th news I coudl never have imagined it would be opposite where I live. it's just awful.\\"      Another resident, Peter Nosike, 37, said: \\"It seems almost impossible that something like this could happen here. It's just shocking.      \\"I know most of the people who live on this block but I've never noticed the people who lived there, which is strange because it's quite open on the estate and we all overlook each other.\\"      Aneeta Prem, founder of the Freedom Charity, said: “We have seen an extraordinary rise in calls to our helpline since the rescue of the three women came into the public domain.      “We received five times as many calls in 24 hours as we normally do in one week and are needing to increase our resources to cope with this extra demand.      “These women have had traumatic and disturbing experiences, which they have revealed to us.      “What needs to happen now is that the three victims, who have begun a long process of recovery, are able to go through their rehabilitation undisturbed, without being identified.” ||||| Police are examining whether three women who were held in a south London house under what detectives described as extreme emotional control for 30 years were part of a cult which operated through beatings and brainwashing to bind them to their captors.      The complex relationship between the women and the couple who are suspected of exerting such influence over them that in three decades they never tried to leave, is at the centre of what senior officers indicated on Friday was going to be a lengthy inquiry.      Officers are also investigating whether the youngest woman, who is aged 30 and thought to have been born inside the house, was the daughter of the 57-year-old Irish woman who eventually reached out for help last month in a phone call to a charity she had seen on the news.      The Guardian understands the 30-year-old's father is allegedly the 67-year-old man who was arrested with his partner, also 67, on suspicion of domestic servitude, false imprisonment and offences against the person. On Friday, both were released on police bail after questioning.      According to those close to the case, the 30-year-old's birth was registered with the authorities and as such should have sparked visits from health visitors and midwives, but it is not known whether that happened. She never went to school, but is able to read and write, and has been described as intelligent.      Two sources close to the case indicated that the three women were held in the house through a relationship of control which was akin to a semi-religious cult. The third woman freed was a 69-year-old from Malaysia.      The police revealed on Friday that the details emerging were unlike any domestic servitude or forced labour case they had investigated before. The women were able to leave at certain times, but always in a controlled and chaperoned situation.      Commander Steve Rodhouse, of the Metropolitan police, said: \\"We do not believe that this case falls into the category of sexual exploitation, or what we all understand as human trafficking.      \\"It is not as brutally obvious as women being physically restrained inside an address and not allowed to leave. We are trying to understand what were the invisible handcuffs that were used to exert such a degree of control over these women … What we have uncovered so far is a complicated and disturbing picture of emotional control over many years, brainwashing would be the simplest term.\\"      His colleague DI Kevin Hyland said the women suffered beatings in the house.      Aneeta Prem, founder of the Freedom Charity, which helped rescue the women, said they lived in basic conditions. \\"Their movements were controlled while they were in the house. They had to perform various duties within the house and they weren't given options not to do those things.\\"      Rodhouse also revealed that the suspects – who are being investigated by the UK Border Agency over their immigration status – were arrested by the Metropolitan police four decades ago and may have been in touch with other public services over the years. He said: \\"To the outside world, they may have appeared to be a normal family. This does mean that over the course of many decades the people at the heart of this investigation and their victims will probably have come into contact with public services, including our own.\\" He added that the two suspects \\"were arrested by the Metropolitan police in the 1970s\\". The women were being looked after by the Freedom Charity – which helped to rescue them after the Irish woman made a call for help on 18 October after seeing the founder on the television news. On 25 October, they walked to freedom at a pre-arranged time.      Prem said the organisation had received calls from other people saying they were being held. \\"This has to be a story of hope. A number of calls are coming through from people who have seen the media coverage and want to tell us they are in the same situation,\\" she said. One report suggested that it was the failure to call for medical help when the oldest woman suffered a stroke that led to the call to the charity.      Hyland, who is leading the investigation, said the very process of the women explaining what had happened over such a long period of time was traumatising in itself. He added that the whole of his team of 37 officers were working on the case and removed 55 bags of evidence amounting to more than 2,500 exhibits from the property in south London. Prem, who has met the women several times, said that the couple suspected of holding them were like any other couple and were not extraordinary. As such she believes the neighbours didn't know. \\"If you'd been in a village maybe this wouldn't have happened because people would have noticed something, but I think in the centre of London you don't notice.\\"      The women are understood to be concerned that the suspects have been released without charge on police bail. But Rodhouse said the investigation would take \\"some considerable time\\". He said: \\"We are unpicking a story that spans at least 30 years of these women's lives, and all of this requires police activity to turn that into evidence. While that process continues we have released the suspects on bail, but they have not returned to the property.\\"      A CPS spokesperson said: \\"We have provided the Metropolitan Police Service with some very early investigative advice on this matter. We have not been asked to consider any evidence or to give charging advice at this stage.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Three women, aged 69, 57, and 30, were allegedly held as slaves in south London for 30 years. The women, hailing from Malaysia, Ireland, and Britain, respectively, were originally introduced to their captors through a shared political ideology and have since lived under their emotional control. The accused are an Indian and Tanzanian couple that migrated to the UK in the 1960s. The victims resided with their alleged captors in a three-storey council block in Peckford Place, Stockwell. The women endured what police described as extreme brainwashing and emotional coercion, tied to them in a manner akin to an obscure kind of cult, bound by \\"invisible handcuffs\\". The women were permitted to leave the house only in a controlled and supervised manner. Officers characterised this case as unique as it doesn't typically align with standard cases of human trafficking or sexual exploitation. The youngest victim, a British native, had lived with the suspects all her life and is believed to be the daughter of the 57-year-old Irish woman. She was born in the house and never attended school, although she can read and write. The rescue was made possible following a call from the Irish woman to the Freedom Charity, a charity working with victims of forced labour. Post-negotiations, the victims were released from the property and are currently receiving unique care and support at an undisclosed location while officers continue their investigation. The suspects in question were arrested and questioned, but have been released on bail until January. The authorities are slowly but steadily gathering more information about the case, being cautious to protect the victims' identities due to their vulnerable and highly sensitive emotional state."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For Hayek, the supposedly stark difference between authoritarianism and totalitarianism has much importance and Hayek places heavy weight on this distinction in his defence of transitional dictatorship. For example, when Hayek visited Venezuela in May 1981, he was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \\"totalitarianism with authoritarianism,\\" and said that he was unaware of \\"any totalitarian governments in Latin America. The only one was Chile under Allende\\". For Hayek, however, the word 'totalitarian' signifies something very specific: the want to “organize the whole of society” to attain a “definite social goal” —which is stark in contrast to “liberalism and individualism”.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Trudeau to be questioned over reports of fundraisers offering privileged access Justin Trudeau will be questioned by Canada’s ethics watchdog over reports of political fundraisers that allegedly offered privileged access to the prime minister and his cabinet ministers for a price. The development marks the first time in a decade that the ethics commissioner has questioned a sitting prime minister and is a turning point for Trudeau who swept to a majority government last year on broad promises to run a transparent administration that would abide by the highest standards of ethics. The scandal began brewing in October, after a series of media reports documented Liberal party fundraisers being held in the homes of wealthy Canadians and which offered access to members of Trudeau’s government for up to C1,500 (1,100) a ticket. The reports raised questions of whether the government was opening itself up to behind-the-scenes lobbying, such as a report by the Globe and Mail that quoted a British Columbia multimillionaire who said he had urged the prime minister to allow Chinese investment in senior care and real estate development just as the government was reviewing a bid by a China-based company to purchase a majority stake in one of British Columbia’s largest chains of retirement homes. The allegations, which have left Trudeau and his government fending off daily accusations of wrongdoing, triggered complaints to the ethics commissioner from the opposition Conservatives and the New Democratic party. Responding to the complaint from the Conservatives, Mary Dawson, Canada’s ethics commissioner said in a letter on Thursday that while there is no evidence to date to suggest that Trudeau violated the country’s conflict of interest act, she would query Trudeau over his involvement with the fundraising events. A copy of the letter was provided to the Guardian. Addressed to interim Conservative leader, Rona Ambrose, the letter noted Dawson’s unease over the issue. “While the information provided in support of the allegations is not sufficient to cause me to initiate an examination under the act at this time, your letter and media articles leave me with concerns in relation to Mr Trudeau’s interactions with individuals involved with the canola export agreement, Wealth One Bank and Anbang Insurance Group,” Dawson wrote. No timeline was given as to when she would question Trudeau. A spokesperson for the ethics commissioner confirmed that Dawson is looking into the matter and noted that it is the usual practice of the commissioner to follow up with questioning when the office receives a letter containing allegations. Based on the answers provided by the prime minister, the ethics commissioner will then determine whether a full-scale investigation should be launched. In late October, Canada’s lobbying commissioner announced it would launch an investigation into the fundraisers in order to determine whether any of the government rules around lobbying had been breached. The allegations of trading cash for access have come as a blow to Trudeau, as they appear to contradict accountability rules issued by the prime minister after his government came into power last year. The rules, which aim to go one step further than the fundraising rules that ban corporate and union donations and limit individual donations to a maximum of C1,500 annually, state “there should be no preferential access to government, or appearances of preferential access, accorded to individuals or organisations because they have made financial contributions to politicians and political parties”. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trudeau said he would work with the ethics commissioner to answer any questions she may have. “We have very strict rules on fundraising at the federal level and no one is suggesting that we are not following those rules. And that’s something that is important for Canadians to remember,” he said. “Our commitment is to show the highest level of ethical standards, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.” Earlier this week, Trudeau acknowledged that government business is discussed at the fundraisers – contrary to what officials from the Liberal party had previously told reporters – but insisted that donors have no special sway when it comes to government policy.","output":"Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is to be questioned by the national ethics watchdog over allegations of political fundraisers offering privileged access to Trudeau and his government. Liberal party fundraisers, reportedly held in the homes of wealthy Canadians, were said to offer privileged access at 1,100 a ticket. The allegations come in the wake of media coverage of behind-the-scenes lobbying for Chinese investment in senior care and real estate development by a British Columbia multi-millionaire. Mary Dawson, the Canadian ethics commissioner, said she would question Trudeau over his involvement with fundraising events, though she confirmed there was no evidence to suggest he had violated the country's Conflict of Interest Act. No date has been given for the interrogation, which the ethics commissioner will use to ascertain whether a full-scale investigation is necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: a ) 11 , b ) 12 , c ) 17 , d ) 19 , e ) 21","output":"To solve this problem, follow these simple steps: Step 1: Understand the problem The original class has an average age of 40 years, and 12 new students join the class with an average age of 32 years. This change causes the overall average age to decrease by 4 years. We need to find the original number of students in the class. Step 2: Set up the equation Let x be the original number of students in the class, and let T be the total age of all students in the original class. The average age is calculated by dividing the total age by the number of students. Therefore: Original average age = T / x = 40 Step 3: Use the information provided in the problem When 12 new students join the class with an average age of 32 years, the total age of all students becomes T + (12 * 32) and the total number of students becomes x + 12. The new average age will be 4 years less than the original average, so: New average age = (T + 12 * 32) / (x + 12) = 40 - 4 = 36 Step 4: Solve the equation Now we have two equations: (1) T / x = 40 (2) (T + 12 * 32) / (x + 12) = 36 First, solve equation (1) for T: T = 40*x Now substitute this into equation (2): (40*x + 12 * 32) / (x + 12) = 36 Simplify the equation and solve for x: 40x + 384 = 36x + 432 4x = 48 x = 12 Step 5: Identify the answer The original strength of the class was: x = 12 (Option b) So the correct answer is option b) 12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Bees will begin to chew max until it becomes softened - The chewed up wax will be stored inside of a honeycomb - Worker bees continue chewing and softening wax from within - The chewed up wax is steadily added, making the hive bigger and bigger - The bees will house nectar, honey and pollen within the honeycomb's cells - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of this process is the collection of raw materials by the worker bees to produce the wax required for building and expanding the honeycomb structure. This begins with the foraging worker bees venturing out from the hive in search of nectar-rich flowers.  While foraging, these worker bees also collect pollen from the flowers, which is an essential protein source for the colony. The nectar, on the other hand, is their primary source of carbohydrates, providing them with the necessary energy for their various activities within and outside of the hive. Upon ingesting the nectar, the sugar it contains is converted by enzymes into a substance called bee bread, which is stored in their honey stomachs. As the bees continue to collect nectar and consume it, their bodies begin to produce wax from special glands located on the underside of their abdomen. These glands secrete tiny wax flakes, which protrude from the surface of the bee's body and can be easily removed by the worker bees. It is this raw wax material that becomes the essential building block for constructing and enlarging the honeycomb structure within the hive. Thus, the foraging and collection of nectar by worker bees, combined with the secretion and processing of this raw material into usable wax, serve as the critical first steps in the honeycomb building process. This task plays a vital role in the colony's health, organization, and overall survival, as the honeycomb is used not only for storing nectar, honey, and pollen but also for housing their young and providing protection for the queen bee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last names of the band members in the passage that didn't have trouble with deportation? from the following article ?  Koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \\"exi\\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles. When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass. Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records. As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

It is also possible to purchase it online.  Select paprika in good condition. Available choices:  (a). In the fridge, rub some paprika on your hands. Be sure to dry your hands before eating it.  (b). Check the appearance of the cloves. Fresh cloves develop a greenish appearance and may look bitter or rotten.  (c). Paprika should be : In date ground finely and evenly shiny in colour and consistent Choose paprika according to your recipe needs. Paprika is available in various styles, including smoked.  (d). Although paprika is a natural spice, it's not healthy for humans; the oils will cause serious illnesses. Look for even better quality paprika than what is advertised on market-bought soups or casseroles.","output":"(c). Paprika should be: In date, ground finely and evenly, shiny in colour, and consistent. Choose paprika according to your recipe needs. Paprika is available in various styles, including smoked. When selecting the most appropriate paprika for your needs, it's essential to consider not only the quality of the spice but also its specific characteristics. Paprika is a ground spice made from dried bell peppers and chili peppers, and it comes in various forms, primarily sweet, hot, or smoked. Each type imparts distinct flavors and properties, so it's crucial to select the right variety for your recipe. First and foremost, always check the expiration date on the packaging. Spices do not last forever and gradually lose their potency and flavor profile over time, which means that using an expired product may impact the taste of your dish. Ground paprika should be fine and evenly textured. This ensures that the spice will mix well with other ingredients, preventing clumping and allowing the flavors to blend smoothly. A consistent, fine grind also indicates proper processing and contributes to an even distribution of flavor. The colour of the paprika should be shiny and consistent throughout, indicating that it has not been exposed to excessive light, heat, or humidity, which can cause the spice to deteriorate and lose its flavor. Paprika naturally has a vibrant red hue, and a shiny, even coloration showcases its freshness and intensity. To make the most appropriate choice for your recipe, consider the different styles of paprika available. Sweet paprika is the most common variety, offering mild, slightly sweet flavor notes. Hot paprika, as its name suggests, is spicier and may be more appropriate for recipes that require a touch of heat. Smoked paprika is another option; it is made by smoking the peppers before drying and grinding them, adding a deep, smoky flavor profile that pairs well with hearty dishes and meats. In summary, to select the best suitable paprika for your culinary needs, always verify the expiration date, ensure the ground consistency and vibrant color, and choose the specific type – sweet, hot, or smoked – that aligns with the desired taste and characteristics of your dish. By doing so, you'll maximize the flavor, aroma, and overall enjoyment of your culinary creation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour.

Given the following passage  \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian.

Question: Where is Von Stein caught by Officer Gast? Movie title: The Third Generation Movie plot: P.J. Lurz, an industrialist with an office in a Berlin high-rise, informs his American headquarters that the company has difficulty selling its security-related computer systems to the West German government in Bonn. Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting. They are: August Brem, the ringleader; Susanne's composer husband Edgar; feminist history professor Hilde Krieger; Petra Vielhabor, a housewife who is constantly arguing with her banker husband Hans; and Rudolf Mann, a clerk in a record store. P.J. Lurz is informed by Gerhard Gast, the inspector-general of the police, that he is being watched and is under police protection. Gast has also arrived to pick up Susanne, his daughter-in-law. En route to their home, Susanne and Gerhard stop at a hotel room and have sex. They have been carrying on an affair with sado-masochistic undertones. The Gast family has dinner together: Gerhardt, Susanne, her husband Edgar, the caustic grandfather, the delusional pianist grandmother and the young coupleâs small son. During dinner Grandpa Gast tells Edgar that every generation needs a war. The terrorists gather at Rudolfâs large apartment, but August is annoyed by the presence of Rudolfâs roommate Ilse Hoffman, a drug addict. August sees her as a threat to their secret activities.

However, considering the context provided, if you meant to ask about how the characters and their activities are caught by Officer Gast, here's what happens: Officer Gast, being the inspector-general of the police, learns about the secret group of middle-class leftists and their plot. He's in a unique position since he is having an affair with Susanne, who is a part of the terrorist cell. Throughout the movie, Gast keeps a close eye on their activities and the secret group. Towards the end of the movie, the group kidnaps an industrialist, Peter Lurz, but ends up releasing him. The police, led by Officer Gast, become even more aware of the terrorists' activities and follow the group closely.

Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe.

Three years ago, the residents of Galena, in Alaska, were forced to abandon their homes when the Yukon River flooded the town. The Alaska Air National Guard and the National Army Guard evacuated around 300 residents from the surrounding area, many of whom eventually returned to find their homes no longer suitable for habitation. Since then, the town has been rebuilt and one of the residents, Adriana Hevezi, invited British photographer Ed Gold to document the re-formed community having seen his book, Wales: Portrait of an Alaska Village at a friend's house in Fairbanks. Gold took up the challenge and set off to reach the Alaskan community. One of the first pictures Gold took was of the funeral of long-time Galena resident Sidney Huntingdon, whose casket was taken on sledges behind snow machines along the frozen Yukon River to the cemetery. Gold spent more than six weeks in Galena, which is just 80 miles (130km) from the Arctic Circle, from late 2015 to early 2016, shooting on film. He chose to use a 35mm Contax II camera made in the mid-1930s and a Polaroid Pathfinder 110A from the mid-1950s, and found himself constantly battling with the effects of cold weather on equipment and film stock. While there, Gold found himself helping residents search for Andrew Henry, of Ruby, who had gone through the ice on the Yukon River while travelling between Ruby and Galena. His body has not been recovered. Gold's portraits capture some of the residents, along with their personal history. I came to Alaska in 1986 to look for work, any kind of work. There was a depression in Washington State so I came up here. I got sucked into adventuring straightaway so didn't do any work. Me and a good friend drove to Eagle. We had no money and ran out of everything but we built a raft and travelled down the Yukon River to Galena. The raft was 24ft long with a gas stove, a little house on it with a chicken coop and two chickens. We had hundreds of pounds of rice and beans but eventually we ran out. We'd stop at villages and hang out and let the chickens get used to land. My girlfriend was pregnant and we asked for work along the way. Everyone said go to Galena as we'd find work there. We got here, jumped off the raft - I had already drawn up a sign saying \\"looking for work\\" and I put it in the liquor store. Within an hour, I had got work and I have been here ever since. This house was built in 1971 by Jenie Olson, a teacher out here and it was raised about 3ft after the flood in 2013. The water was literally on my carpet. We bought it as an abandoned house in 1994. It's just one bedroom, it had been vandalised by kids, written all over the walls. One of the main reasons I've stayed is I have really great people who I work with. It's a great community - if you're in need they'll have a raffle for you and can raise over 5,000 in a night. There's about 450 people here right now. To live here, you need to be versatile, self-starters, self-entertainers. Hunting and trapping is right out your back door. Over the years, I have gotten to the stage where the dark and the cold in the winters has really gotten to me. It's a great place to save money as there are no stores to spend but other items are twice as expensive so you have to tighten your belt. When the river decided to flood, that was the day change was beckoned. My Mom was up here and she asked me to come up to help her out. She bought me a ticket. I told my boss and girlfriend I was going for a week. I saw a few weird things when I arrived like large icebergs on the side of the road and cars flipped over. On the flight up, a guy asked what I can do and he offered me a job there and then for 25 an hour. I helped my Mom and a lot of others out and decided that moving to Galena was a good idea. My girlfriend moved up with me. Everyone's a one-off here. When you go outside you don't know what you're going to find. In the city, if you look at how people get their endorphins, they are totally entertainment-based from an iPhone or an arcade. Living here instils values within you which are useful to have in the first world, like survival. I've learned how much more there is to learn about bush living but I don't want to be here forever. I have a Ducati motorbike I want to travel on and I want to go base- jumping in other countries. There's no billboards or adverts here. I think that the luxuries that people have come to expect are not sustainable here. A lot of things that are important become secondary concerns, like what to eat and where to get shelter. In the bush, we just get things done. This is the last structure on the last road out of town for hundreds of miles. It's right on the edge of town, to untouched wilderness. I was born in Nulato in 1927 and was adopted right after I was born. I never knew who my real parents were until I was nine years old. I was on my way to school then my cousin, John Henry, ran up to me and said you have two moms and two dads. I got into a fight with him and pushed him then ran home. I told my stepmom and on the way to school the next day he said it again and that's how I found out. Once in a great while I'd see my parents but not stay with them. In 1940, I went to Catholic school in Holy Cross for seven years. From Holy Cross, I went to Bethel and I got married and I didn't come home for 36 years. I had 14 children. Only six are still living. When I came home I had nothing and was lucky to get a job cleaning rooms at the firefighting department. I was divorced by then. I have 103 grandchildren. They're all scattered all the way down the coast to Anchorage and I have two or three great-great-great grand baby girls. I come from the Tanana village on the Yukon River, Alaska. My dad, Sidney, was half white and half Athabascan, his dad was all white - a miner from New York. My mother, Angela, is full Athabascan. When I was 12, I'd watch the dog sledding on a TV and in 1972 I was a helper and handler for Carl, my brother, at the start of the Iditarod Great Sled Race at Anchorage town, a race he won in 1974. I decided to try mushing eight years ago and I am the first deaf musher. I plan on going to college, to do something in the medical field as I like to help people. My grandmother made my kuspuk [hooded top] this past summer, she does a lot of sewing. My mukluks [boots] have seal skin bottoms and are made from hide and beaver. My grandma got them for me and I've had them for two years, I wear them a lot to potlatches [traditional feasts] and cultural days at school. The log cabin has been abandoned for as long as I can remember. It's run-down inside with old possessions lying around. I went inside because I was just curious, it was kind of spooky in a way, I felt like I shouldn't touch anything. I have had this bicycle of over 20 years and, apart from my parents, this is the second longest relationship I've had with anything. That's more or less true, I do have a sister also who qualifies as a longer relationship. It was purchased in 1997 near my home town of St Charles, Illinois. I bought it at a time when me and my friends were interested in long-distance bicycle trips. I call my gloves \\"loose dogs\\" because there have been incidents when I have been wearing these mitts and dogs have run up and acted aggressively towards my gloves thinking that perhaps they are two dogs wanting to play. Extreme cold plunge mitts are critical gear for me. Being functional here is all about having the right gear and having the right attitude. I wear a thin-lined glove under them and they're usually too warm. Mentally it gives you a feeling that you have a fighting chance with these, that I will not get frostbite. I started the retail hardware part of it in late 2012 and I'm just guessing I have about 20,000 items for sale in this store. My customers in general are what we refer to in Alaska as a subsistence user, basically a householder who uses basic items to live off the land to survive. I sell these knives for processing fish and game. The bullets are .22 calibre. Their main purpose is for harvesting small game - upland grouse, spruce land grouse and ruffed grouse. I'm a hunter and trapper and started when I was nine years old in Iowa. Not that many people trap anymore. I think that 5,000 are licensed in the whole of Alaska.

The paragraph highlights a conflict between the lawyer's account of the situation - that is, the leaked memos, and James Comey's testimony. However, the relationship between Trump's lawyer and the press is not explicitly mentioned or discussed in this paragraph. What we can infer from the statements made by Marc Kasowitz, President Trump's personal lawyer, is that there might be some tension between him and the media. He accuses James Comey of leaking privileged information and points out the discrepancy between the dates of the New York Times quoting the memos and Comey's claim of leaking them in response to a tweet. This could suggest that Kasowitz is trying to discredit the media's use of leaked information, which may hint at a strained relationship between him and the press.

Understand the statements: The first statement (\\"A child in a Care Bears blanket\\") indicates that there is a child and that the child is somehow within the confines of a Care Bears blanket. The second statement (\\"A child wraps a Care Bears blanket around its body\\") describes the action of a child wrapping the Care Bears blanket around their body. 2. Determine the relationship between the statements: The first statement does not specify how the child is in the Care Bears blanket, whether wrapped, covered, or just touching it. The second statement specifies a particular action - that the child wraps the blanket around their body. 3. Evaluate if the first statement logically follows the second: Since the first statement does not provide enough information about the child's interaction with the Care Bears blanket, we cannot conclude that the child wraps the blanket around their body based solely on the knowledge that the child is \\"in\\" the blanket. It's possible, but other scenarios could also apply, such as the child lying on top of the blanket or being covered by the blanket without wrapping it around their body. 4.

Sentence 2: There's no point in clicking below, as he has not comment. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To analyze whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we need to understand the meaning and context of both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"Click below for his unctuous commentary on this.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is directing the reader or listener to access a presumably insincere, overly sincere, or excessively flattering commentary made by someone referred to as \\"he.\\" The term \\"unctuous\\" implies that the commentary is likely to be disingenuous or smarmy. This sentence assumes that there is a commentary available for the reader or listener to access, and that this commentary is noteworthy for its insincere nature. Sentence 2: \\"There's no point in clicking below, as he has not comment.\\" This sentence is conveying that there is no purpose in following the instruction given in the first sentence; in this case, clicking below. The reason provided is that \\"he,\\" the person referred to in the first sentence, has not provided any commentary. The use of \\"not comment\\" could be a typo or grammatical error, as the correct phrasing would typically be \\"has not commented\\" or \\"has no comment.\\" Now, we will consider the possibility that the first sentence is true, and how it affects the truth of the second sentence. If Sentence 1 is true, it means that there is a commentary provided by \\"he,\\" which features an insincere tone. In this situation, the second sentence's claim that \\"he has not comment\\" would be false because the first sentence has established the presence of a commentary. As a result, the assertion that there is \\"no point in clicking below\\" would also be false, as there is, in fact, a commentary to access. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is not true. The two sentences present conflicting information; one stating that commentary exists, while the other denies its existence. With the first sentence being true, we can conclude that the second sentence is false in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. It plays a critical role in supporting life on Earth, as it is the primary source of oxygen and organic compounds required for various organisms, including humans. Here is a more detailed and complete sequence of events in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis: 1. Absorption of light: The process begins when chlorophyll and accessory pigments (such as carotenoids and phycobiliproteins) in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts absorb photons from sunlight. This excites the electrons in the pigments to a higher energy state, initiating the photosynthetic process. 2. Excitation of electrons and formation of a high-energy species: The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart water molecules (H2O) through a process known as photolysis. This step is crucial as it provides the necessary electrons, hydrogen ions (protons), and oxygen molecules needed for the subsequent reactions. 3. Generation of oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons: As you mentioned, the water breaks into oxygen (O2), hydrogen (H2), and electrons. The oxygen produced diffuses out of the plant as a waste product, which is vital for the survival of aerobic organisms. 4. Electron transport chain and generation of ATP: The energized electrons are passed along a series of proteins called the electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane. As the electrons move through this chain, they release energy that helps to pump protons across the membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient ultimately drives the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), an essential energy molecule for the plant and other living organisms. 5. Formation of NADPH: Finally, hydrogen ions and the energized electrons are used to convert NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) into NADPH, a high-energy electron carrier molecule. NADPH plays a critical role in the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) of photosynthesis, where it helps convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose (C6H12O6). In summary, the missing first step of the process is the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll and accessory pigments, which excites electrons and initiates the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions produce oxygen as a waste product, ATP as an energy source, and NADPH as an electron carrier, all of which contribute to the overall process of photosynthesis and sustenance of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Why Student Athletes Continue To Fail Seventy-four college underclassmen have been declared eligible for the NFL’s upcoming draft, but Ohio State’s quarterback Cardale Jones won’t be among them. A few days after winning the national championship game in January, Jones shocked fans and football analysts by saying he wasn’t ready to go pro, that it was important for him to graduate from college first. What made the announcement all the more surprising, beyond the fact that Jones may never again be as desirable an NFL prospect as he is the year he won a national championship, was that his previous claim to fame was a notorious tweet posted two years ago in which he complained about the “college” part of being a college football player. He wrote that he’d gone to Ohio State to play football, not “to play school,” and that classes were pointless. Jones now regrets and disavows that tweet. Earlier this month, he was tweeting that nothing is more important than education, under the hashtag “StudentBeforeAthlete.” It’s hard to know how sincere his attitude adjustment has been, or how sincere his initial dismissal of academics was. What is clear is that Jones and his conversion represent a messaging coup for his university and for the NCAA, which has maintained for decades that its primary goal is to help scholar-athletes receive an education that would prepare them for life beyond sports. Despite the NCAA’s insistence that it is concerned about student athletes’ academic growth, it often feels as though “student” plays second fiddle to “athlete.” Indeed, on a typical day, a visitor to the NCAA homepage will be overwhelmed by the articles (and videos) about athletics but will not find a single article (or video) about the academic achievements of the athletes. This also seems to hold true for many of the NCAA’s member schools. The University of North Carolina and Syracuse are just two of the most recent universities to be under the spotlight for academic scandals involving student athletes. UNC offered a “no show” class for student athletes (where students received grades for phantom classes that they didn’t attend), and Syracuse allowed academically ineligible athletes to compete. And while these cases are the ones currently grabbing headlines, they are hardly unique; The Chronicle of Higher Education is reporting that 20 additional schools are being investigated for academic fraud. And what about the student athletes themselves? Student-athletes tend to take easier classes and get lower grades than non-athletes. This is not only true for schools from power conferences in big-money sports, it has been observed in Division III liberal arts colleges and Ivy League schools, neither of which even offer athletic scholarships. It’s tempting to believe that student athletes care only about their sport, and not about their schoolwork, as many popular commentators have suggested – and as Ohio State’s Jones once tweeted — except that in the dozen years that I’ve been teaching in university settings, that hasn’t been my experience at all. I’ve taught hundreds of Division 1 student athletes at several different schools, and they have been among the hardest working students I’ve encountered. The student athletes I’ve worked with have viewed their sport as a complement to, not a replacement for, their studies. My observations were hardly unique. One of my students, Josh Levine, ran a youth hockey clinic and was upset by the widespread perception that the students he worked with did not care about school. After several conversations about the issue, we decided that the only way to find out the truth was to run a study. And so we did, surveying 147 student athletes (including some still in high school) involved in various team sports from football and basketball to lacrosse and golf about how much both they and their teammates cared about sports and academics.” Here’s what we found: When student athletes were asked how much they care about athletics, they rated their interest a healthy 8.5 on average, on a scale of 1 to 10. But when asked the value they place on academics, the result was higher than 9 on average. If anything, the average student athlete cares more about his studies than his sport. #StudentBeforeAthlete indeed. So why do they underperform in their classes? One possible and intriguing reason suggested by our study is that student athletes don’t think their teammates take academics as seriously as they do. When asked to assess how much their teammates cared about athletics, the athletes were close, guessing 8.8. However, when asked to evaluate how much their teammates cared about academics, those same athletes guessed only 7.8 – far below the 9+ average. Why is this important? Because when an athlete thinks that the rest of the team doesn’t care about academics, that athlete tries to fit in by pretending not to care either. In a perverse form of peer pressure, Cardale Jones’s tweet about classes being worthless may be what student athletes tell each other in an effort to fit in, based on the mistaken belief that if they care about academics, they are in an uncool minority. All of this creates a distressing and self-perpetuating cycle. Tight-knit student athletes will seek ways of fitting into a culture that they perceive as neglecting academics (by defaulting into majors of dubious merit and spending less time doing homework), knowing that their habits are observed by teammates. When their teammates observe those habits, it reaffirms the (false) conviction that caring about academics is an unfortunate aberration, best suppressed. One of my co-authors on this project, Sara Etchison, has described this process particularly well: “There are student athletes who want to excel in the classroom, but think their teammates would judge them for it, so they study a little less, or take an easier major. And it turns out, that’s how virtually everyone on the team feels, but there’s never an opportunity to realize, ‘Oh wait, all of us really care about what’s happening on the academic side.’” This is a phenomenon that psychologists call “pluralistic ignorance” – when private preferences differ from perceptions of group norms. It leads people to engage in public behaviors that align more with the perceived norms than with their true preferences. The tragedy is that the norms are false – in reality, everybody would be happier if they just behaved in line with their true preferences. Pluralistic ignorance has also been shown to underlie the phenomenon of binge-drinking on campuses. A study conducted at Princeton University revealed that a majority of students who drink excessively did so not because they wanted to, but because they felt that was what their friends wanted to do. Once they all had a more accurate assessment of what the group norm was, the amount of alcohol consumed declined. This suggests that helping student athletes do better in the classroom may be as simple as letting them know that their teammates care as much about academics as they do. Many of them care deeply about the education they are receiving, and should care, because financial success in professional sports will elude the vast majority of them. As the NCAA and the media focus more attention on athletes’ academic performance, one of the best ways to improve the education of student athletes is to give them license to pursue their academic goals by making it clear that their teammates, and society as a whole, support them in their academic endeavors. For this to happen, we will need many more stars like Cardale Jones speaking out about the importance of education, instead of tweeting about the pointlessness of going to class. Daniel Oppenheimer is a professor of psychology and marketing at the Anderson School of Management at UCLA. He is the author of over 30 peer-reviewed journals, and several books, including Democracy Despite Itself: Why a System that Shouldn’t Work at All Works So Well. In addition to numerous awards for his teaching and research, he won the 2006 Ig Nobel science humor award. He wrote this for Zocalo Public Square.","output":"This article talks about student athletes and their challenges in balancing school life and sports. Cardale Jones, a college football player, decided to graduate first before entering the professional league. Despite being very talented in the field, he chose to prioritize education over sports. Though there are other student athletes who feel pressured by their teammates to focus on sports and care less about academics, it is important to promote education as a priority. By supporting their academic goals and giving them the license to pursue it, we can improve the overall well-being of student athletes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Given the standings of the two men, the painting was received in both social and political terms. A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \\"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \\"opportunism and cynicism\\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \\"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\\".Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited.

The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance. Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience.

I would then compile the information and identify the provider that best fits the given criteria, keeping in mind that \\"best\\" is subjective and may vary depending on individual preferences and needs. Second question: How can I see the saved Wi-Fi passwords on my mobile? To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step instructions based on the type of mobile device the user has—an Android or iOS device. For Android: 1. Ensure the device is rooted. 2. Install any file manager app that supports root access, such as ES File Explorer. 3. Open the file manager, grant it root access, and navigate to the directory named \\"data.\\" 4. Locate the \\"misc\\" folder and then access the \\"wifi\\" folder. 5. Inside the \\"wifi\\" folder, look for a file named \\"wpa_supplicant.conf\\" and open it using a text editor. 6. The file will contain the saved Wi-Fi networks and their passwords in the \\"psk\\" field. For iOS: 1. Install a third-party app, like iFile, that allows browsing the iPhone's system files. 2. Open iFile and navigate to the directory named \\"private.\\" 3. Locate the \\"var\\" folder and then access the \\"keychains\\" folder. 4. Inside the \\"keychains\\" folder, look for a file named \\"keychain-2.db\\" and open it using SQLite Editor. 5. Browse the database and find the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) along with its password. Now, to address the question, \\"Are these two questions asking the same thing?\\" No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question seeks information about the best available WiFi connection in Mumbai. The second question asks for a method to view saved Wi-Fi passwords on a mobile device. The primary focus of each question is different—one is about network quality and service, while the other is about accessing specific information on a user's device."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose talent was recognized by an award of £100 from the British Institution in 1828? ?  In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

Goalkeepers are allowed to handle the ball if the ball is played back to them by an action other than a kick or throw-in (such as a header), but defenders are not permitted to attempt to use a deliberate trick to pass the ball to the goalkeeper with a part of the body other than the foot to circumvent the rule. This would include flicking the ball up with the foot and then heading the ball back to the goalkeeper, or heading a ball on the ground that would otherwise be regularly playable with the foot.

However, the meridian passes through Russia and Fiji as well as Antarctica.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys.

In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her. The narrating nurse probably believes that: - Connie was worth defending before she took action - not enough information - Connie will report the then impatient nurse for pouring cold water on her - Connie will come back one day to thank her The answer to this question is:","output":"The narrating nurse likely believes that: 1. Connie was worth defending before she took action: The nurse felt empathy towards Connie and her situation, and recognized that Connie deserved to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of her condition. 2. Not enough information was provided about Connie's condition: The narrating nurse was a junior staff member and may not have had access to all of the details about Connie's medical history and diagnosis. This lack of information may have added to the mystery and intrigue of Connie's sudden recovery. 3. Connie might report the impatient nurse for treating her poorly: Since Connie regained her memory and cognitive abilities, she might remember the mistreatment she experienced at the hands of the impatient nurse and potentially report her actions to the hospital administration. 4. Connie could come back one day to express gratitude: The narrating nurse may hope that Connie, now recovered, might return to the hospital one day and express her appreciation for the support and kindness she received from the narrating nurse during her time at the ward. Ultimately, the narrating nurse probably felt a deep sense of satisfaction in standing up for Connie, and she may often ponder the impact of her actions and the potential repercussions for the impatient nurse who treated Connie poorly. Additionally, she might wonder about Connie's life outside the hospital and hope that she found happiness and fulfillment after her miraculous recovery."},{"instruction":"Question: What does Janine discover in Ben's pocket?

Place a small table under a tree or in another shady part of your outdoor space to harden off seedlings at first.  Set plants outdoors on the table for an hour or 2 at the beginning of the hardening off process. Pick from: [a]. Put the plants outdoors during mid-day, when the sun is at its warmest. Protect the seedlings from wind with a wooden board.. [b]. After the skin on the plant overheats or becomes discolored, remove the plant for a little while. Cut back the seedlings in early summer after the first frost so that they won't be as brittle.. [c]. Wait for a frost if new leaf growth occurs after two or three days to then transplant pods. If you notice a frost forming on the plant, repot your seedlings and continue to plant them further after the last watering.. [d].

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work.

The 75% income tax rate has certainly created waves throughout France, especially among the high-earning celebrities, business professionals, and athletes. This increase was aimed at fighting economic disparity and tackling the budget deficit. However, this decision has caused a significant number of wealthy individuals to rethink their residing situation. The French exodus towards countries with more lenient tax policies has gained significant attention due to the number of celebrities and star athletes who have chosen to leave. Gérard Depardieu, a prominent French actor, made headlines when he took up Russian citizenship in response to France's tax increase. Top sports stars have also been affected. Footballers, particularly those who sign with big French clubs like Paris Saint-Germain, are often paid salaries within a range that subjects them to the 75% tax rate. Players in other European countries generally have lower rates, such as 45% in England and 47% in Germany. The focus on French talent in foreign football leagues like the English Premier League has been intensified by these tax changes. In addition to the lure of reduced tax obligations, the English Premier League also offers international exposure and the potential for higher earnings from brand endorsements and sponsorships. Though France's affinity for football remains strong, players and teams are facing challenges due to the tax system. Major Parisian football clubs like Paris Saint-Germain have expressed concerns that this tax rate could prove detrimental to the development and competitiveness of their teams, ultimately hindering their ability to attract and retain top talent. Moreover, small businesses and entrepreneurs have been affected by this policy, as the considerable increase in taxation has led many to seek better opportunities elsewhere, such as in neighboring countries with more favorable economic climates. This trend could, in the long run, harm France's overall growth and innovation as promising new businesses choose to operate in other European countries. The top income tax rate of 75% has undoubtedly generated a wealth of discussion in France and beyond. While it has been praised by some for fostering a more equitable income distribution, it has also garnered criticism for spurring an exodus of high-income earners, entrepreneurs, and star athletes. Ultimately, the success of this policy will depend on its long-term impact on both the French economy and its ability to maintain its cultural and athletic prowess on the world stage. With an ongoing debate around the merits of such a tax rate, only time will tell whether this move by the French government will lead to growth or hinder their nation's economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? somewhat problematic","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"somewhat problematic\\" can be perceived as negative, given that it implies there are issues or challenges present. However, it is important to consider the context in which the sentence is used to determine its overall sentiment. In the given context, \\"problematic\\" has a negative connotation implying that something is causing problems, difficulties, or concerns. The modifier \\"somewhat\\" softens the negativity associated with the term \\"problematic,\\" making the overall sentiment less extreme. This might evoke a sense that while there is an issue, it might not be entirely negative or unsolvable. For example, consider the following sentences: 1. \\"The weather today is somewhat problematic for our picnic.\\" 2. \\"I found the instructions for the assignment to be somewhat problematic.\\" In both instances, the sentiment can be seen as negative because there are issues or concerns present. However, the word \\"somewhat\\" implies that there may be a degree of subjectivity in interpreting the extent of the problem, making the sentiment less negative than if the word \\"problematic\\" were used alone. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"somewhat problematic\\" is essentially negative due to the issues or challenges it suggests, but the use of \\"somewhat\\" makes it less intense.

Our equation looks like this: 347*p - 121*p - 731*p - 4582*p - 55957 = 0 First, we need to add and subtract all the parts with 'p' in them. Imagine these like your toy blocks, and we are putting the same type of blocks together. So let's do that: (347 - 121 - 731 - 4582) * p - 55957 = 0 Now let's do the math inside the parentheses (the numbers we need to add and subtract): (226 - 731 - 4582) * p - 55957 = 0 (-505 - 4582) * p - 55957 = 0 (-5087) * p - 55957 = 0 Now our equation looks like this: -5087*p - 55957 = 0 Next, we want to make this equation easier to solve by getting rid of the negative signs (like flipping our toy blocks to face the right way). We can do that by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1: 5087*p + 55957 = 0 Now, we want to get all the 'p' parts on one side and the number parts without 'p' on the other side, like separating the toy blocks into different groups: 5087*p = -55957 To find out the value of 'p', we need to divide that big number without 'p' (-55957) by the number next to 'p' (5087). I know these numbers seem really big, but we can do it: p = -55957 / 5087 When we divide, we get the answer for the value of 'p': p ≈ -11 So, little buddy, the value of 'p' that solves the equation is approximately -11.

Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\"  Paragraph: Two continents had different histories.

Input: Passage: Robertson moved to Central States Wrestling, where he won the majority of his titles. On October 22, 1981, he won the NWA Central States Television Championship with a victory over Gene Lewis. He lost the belt to Oliver Humperdink later that year but soon regained it in a rematch. On February 18, 1982, however, he dropped the belt back to Lewis. This allowed Robertson to focus on the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, which he won a total of five times. His first reign came in October 1981 when he teamed with Rufus R. Jones to defeat Buzz Tyler and James J. Dillon. His next reign came in March 1982 when he teamed with Steve Regal to win the belts from Roger Kirby and Jerry Valiant. The title changed hands twice more that month, as Kirby and Valiant quickly regained the title only to drop it back to Robertson and Regal. Two months later, Kirby and Valiant won the belts back again. Robertson found a new partner, however, and won the championship by teaming with Hercules Hernandez in August. The reign lasted less than a month, but Robertson and Hernandez held the belts one final time after another victory in September 1982. The following year, Robertson's main success came as a singles wrestler. On February 10, 1983, he won the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship with a victory over Manny Fernandez. He lost the belt to Bob Brown two months later but regained it in a rematch the following week. Robertson's final title reign ended when he dropped the title to Race on June 2, 1983.

Reduce the amount of time goats are milked. Identify and segregate or cull affected goats.","output":"Title: Enhancing Pre-Milking Hygiene Practices to Reduce Infection Risks and Maximize Efficiency in Goat Farming Introduction Goat farming has gone through a revolutionary change over the years, providing livelihood for millions across the globe. As goats play a vital role in the sustenance and economic benefits to farmers, it becomes imperative to adopt effective strategies that ensure high-quality milk production, minimize risks to health, and promote efficiency in milking practices. This article will shed light on building better pre-milking hygiene practices, reducing the time taken to milk goats, and identifying and segregating or culling impacted goats.  Enhancing Pre-Milking Hygiene Pre-milking hygiene practices are critical in ensuring the production of high-quality milk while reducing the spread of infections or contamination that could lead to illness for farmers and consumers. Simple but effective steps can be implemented to promote better hygiene practices. They include: 1. Consistently washing hands: Farmers need to wash their hands thoroughly before and after handling goats, thus minimizing the chances of transmitting infections. 2. Cleaning and sanitizing milking equipment: Regular and thorough cleaning of milking tools and supplies is vital in mitigating the spread of bacteria and other pathogens that could enter the milk supply. 3. Providing a clean and dry milking environment: Regularly cleaning and sanitizing the milking area helps prevent the build-up of bacteria, which could contaminate the milk or infect the goats. 4. Washing the goat's udders: It is essential to clean the udders of the goats before milking to reduce bacterial contamination in the milk. This also helps keep the goat healthy and prevents the spread of pathogens. 5. Training farm laborers: Workers involved in the milking process should be trained on proper pre-milking hygiene routines to comply with standards and ensure a healthy environment for both humans and goats. Reducing Milking Time By reducing the amount of time goats are milked, farmers can improve efficiency and minimize stress on the animals. Here are ways to accomplish this: 1. Implementing automated milking systems: Advanced milking machines can help save time and labor while promoting consistency in the milking process. These systems also ensure that the right amount of milk is extracted, thus preventing any loss due to over-milking. 2. Regular maintenance of milking equipment: To prevent delays caused by malfunctioning equipment, it is crucial to regularly maintain and repair milking tools. This ensures smooth and efficient functioning, leading to reduced milking time and enhanced productivity. 3. Scheduling and organization: By establishing a routine milking schedule and organizing the goats in a systematic manner, farmers can quickly and consistently attend to each animal, minimizing the time spent on milking. Identifying and Segregating Affected Goats Proper identification and segregation or culling of impacted goats is crucial to maintain a healthy herd and guarantee high-quality milk production. Here's how to achieve this: 1. Regular health checks: Keep a watchful eye on the goats for signs of illness, infections, or diseases that may affect their milk production. Regular health checks will also alert farmers to potential problems before they become widespread among the herd. 2. Segregation of affected goats: If any goats show signs of mastitis, a highly contagious disease among goats, or other contagious illnesses, they should be segregated from the herd to prevent the spread of infection. 3. Culling: In cases where the affected goat is not responding to treatment or poses a significant threat to the rest of the herd, farmers may opt to cull the animal. This difficult decision helps to maintain the overall health and productivity of the goat farm. Conclusion Improving pre-milking hygiene, reducing milking time, and effectively identifying and segregating or culling affected goats are essential measures to ensure a productive and healthy goat farm. Implementing these measures can lead to higher milk quality, increased profits, and a better life for both farmers and goats worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is primarily known for his tenure as Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\"), a position he held for 40 years (1976-2016). He was formally terminated by the Met from all his positions and affiliations with the company on March 12, 2018 over sexual misconduct allegations which he denies. Levine made his Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\") debut at age 28 on June 5, 1971, leading a June Festival performance of Tosca. Following further appearances with the company, he was named principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in February 1972. He became the Met's principal conductor in 1973, and its Music Director in 1975. In 1983, he served as conductor and musical director for the Franco Zeffirelli screen adaptation of La Traviata, which featured the Met orchestra and chorus members. He became the company's first artistic director in 1986, and relinquished the title in 2004. In 2005, Levine's combined salary from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Met made him the highest-paid conductor in the country, at 3.5 million.  During Levine's tenure, the Metropolitan Opera orchestra expanded its activities into the realms of recording, and separate concert series for the orchestra and chamber ensembles from The Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Levine led the Metropolitan Opera on many domestic and international tours. For the 25th anniversary of his Met debut, Levine conducted the world premiere of John Harbison's The Great Gatsby, commissioned especially to mark the occasion. On his appointment as general manager of the Met, Peter Gelb emphasized that Levine was welcome to remain as long as he wanted to direct music there. Levine was paid 2.1 million by the Met in 2010.  Following a series of injuries that began with a fall (see below), Levine's subsequent health problems led to his withdrawal from many Metropolitan Opera conducting engagements. Following a May 2011 performance of Die Walkure, Levine formally withdrew from all conducting engagements at the Met. After two years of physical therapy, Levine returned to conducting with a May 2013 concert with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. On September 25, 2013, Levine conducted his first Met performance since May 2011, in a revival production of Cosi fan tutte. Levine was scheduled to conduct three productions at the opera house and three concerts at Carnegie Hall in the 2013-14 season. On April 14, 2016, Met management announced that Levine would step down from his position as Music Director at the end of the 2015-16 season. Levine was paid 1.8 million by the Met for the 2015/16 season. He assumed the new title of Music Director Emeritus, which he held until December 2017, when in the wake of allegations that Levine had sexually abused four young men, the Met suspended its relationship with him and cancelled all his future scheduled performances with the company.

It's increasingly clear that this is the case with school bullying :Only news reports about it have increased, not the behavior itself. In fact, both bullying and fear of it are down among US middle school students The rate of students who reported fearing an attack or harm at school at all has dropped dramatically, from nearly 12% in 1995 to less than 4% in 2011. For black and Hispanic students, it's an even more encouraging shift--from more than 20% of both groups of students worried about being attacked at school to less than 5% in 2011. The decline in actual physical violence in schools is even more dramatic: It was down 74% between 1992 and 2010, according to the latest US Department of Justice data. What about cyberbullying? Online _ increased from 6% in 2000 to 9% in 2005 to 11% in 2010 between, and it's interesting to note that it increased less between 2005 and '10 than in the first 5 years tracked. Because social media is very much a reflection of school social life for young people, the peer aggression seen in social media is a lot like the peer aggression seen on school bathroom walls. So once it finds its \\"dead level,\\" it will probably decline in the same way verbal and written aggression have. Besides education and crime prevention at the social level, medicine treatment and better access to mental healthcare also contribute to this downward trend in victimization of self and others. The rise of social media is what people don't typically think of as a positive force in society. But Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire says, \\"These technologies might have prevented crime and bullying by providing more ways of help, more forms of social supervision, and interesting activities that destroy forms of alienation  that lead to crime\\".

Es erfordert jedoch eine größere politische Entschlossenheit, die Blockierungen beim Gemeinschaftspatent aufzuheben, das sich zu einem Symbol für die Fähigkeit oder die Unfähigkeit der Union entwickelt hat, ihre gesteckten Ziele verwirklichen zu können. Translate to English","output":"However, it requires greater political determination to break the deadlock on the Community patent, which has become a symbol of the European Union's ability or inability to achieve its set goals. The European Union has been working towards establishing a unified and streamlined patent system through the introduction of a Community patent, also known as the European Union patent. This Community patent is intended to provide a single, cost-effective patent protection system covering all member states, eliminating the need for obtaining individual patents in each country, which can be a time-consuming and expensive process. Breaking the deadlock on the Community patent has been challenging due to various political, economic, and legal factors. These challenges stem from differing perspectives, interests, and concerns of the member states. One such challenge is the language regime for filing and processing patent applications. The European Union has 24 official languages, and translating patents into every language can be a costly and time-consuming process. The need for a balance between reducing costs and ensuring effective communication across all member states has been a point of contention. Another issue is the legal framework surrounding the enforcement of patents and the resolution of disputes. Like national laws, patent laws differ across European Union countries, which can lead to inconsistencies in the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. The establishment of a unified European patent court has been proposed as a solution; however, concerns about its jurisdiction, legal basis, and cost-effectiveness have yet to be fully addressed. Furthermore, economic disparities among European Union member states have also contributed to the deadlock. Economically powerful nations, such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, have been more inclined to support the Community patent, citing the potential for improved competitiveness and innovation. In contrast, smaller and less economically developed countries may fear potential disadvantages, such as higher costs or reduced national control over intellectual property rights. Overcoming these challenges requires greater political determination from all European Union member states. This requires a willingness to compromise, find mutually beneficial solutions, and demonstrate a commitment to making the Community patent a reality. For the European Union, the ability to break the deadlock on the Community patent will indeed be symbolic of its capacity to achieve its set goals and foster economic integration and innovation through collaboration. By effectively addressing the concerns of all stakeholders and moving forward together, the European Union can turn the Community patent from a symbol of its inability to a symbol of its success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: For years, Jevon “Goldie” Lawson dealt crack on the steps of a 7-Eleven in a rough part of this blue-collar town. He smoked the rocks he didn’t sell and often appeared as strung out as his customers. But in 2008, he moved into a 400,000 house, started driving a champagne-colored Humvee, and made himself the star act of his own hip-hop label. He abandoned the crack business. Found something better, he told associates. What he found was OxyContin from Southern California, where organized drug rings were colluding with rogue doctors and pharmacies to obtain enormous quantities of the drug. Illicit OxyContin devastated the entire Everett region. At the height of the drug’s popularity, it was a factor in more than half of the crimes in Snohomish County. Abuse of the drug touched off an epidemic of painkiller and heroin addiction, which continues to this day. The crisis swept up many young people, such as Katie McKnight, the daughter of an Everett physician whose dependency outlasted seven trips to rehab, and Brandon Smith, who lost a promising career at Nintendo and, ultimately, his freedom to OxyContin. An Inland Empire branch of the Crips trafficked pills out of L.A. and by plane. The destination was Everett, Wash. Authorities in Everett knew much ofthe drug was coming from traffickers in the Los Angeles area, but they were unable to determine how pills were getting on the black market. A Times review of court records and law enforcement reports suggests that several people who sent OxyContin from Southern California to Lawson in Everett were buying pills from Lake Medical, a clinic near MacArthur Park that was a front for a drug ring. The records, along with interviews of law enforcement officials, indicate that Inland Empire Crips gang members drove bags of OxyContin north on Interstate 5 to Washington State and sent couriers aboard planes to Seattle with pills strapped to their bodies. At the time OxyContin was ravaging Everett, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, was tracking the voluminous prescriptions written by Lake Medical’s doctors as well as the extraordinary quantities of pills ordered by corrupt pharmacies filling those prescriptions. It did not track Lake Medical pills to their final destinations, however. It wasn’t until years later, after authorities brought down the ring, that Purdue shared the information with law enforcement. By then, 1.1 million pills had spilled onto the black market. Everett, a city of 100,000, hugs Port Gardner Bay about halfway between Seattle and the Canadian border. Ferries crisscross the blue-gray waters of Puget Sound; the snowcapped Cascades rise behind the modest skyline. A thriving mill town at the turn of the 20th century, Everett has seen its fortunes rise and fall with various industries — shipbuilding, lumber, iron and canneries. The largest employers today are Boeing, which assembles four types of airliners at a plant along Interstate 5, and the U.S. Navy, which has a deep-water port on the north end of town. The region had long grappled with methamphetamine abuse. But with the California pills flowing to Lawson, OxyContin became the community’s most pressing drug problem. Lawson wasn’t shy about the source of his new wealth. He wore a pendant necklace with a map of the West Coast in diamonds and a trail of gems the color of 80-milligram OxyContin connecting Los Angeles and Washington state. He sold the 80-milligram tablets — the maximum-strength pill favored by addicts — in bulk to local gangs that used small-time dealers to peddle them for up to 80 a piece. Dealers sold pills in parks, outside grocery stores and at car washes. The aluminum foil that addicts used to smoke the pills littered parking lots and sidewalks. Some grocery stores gave away foil squares to discourage the rampant shoplifting of Reynolds Wrap. Addicts burglarized homes, picked pockets, stole identities, robbed businesses and prostituted themselves. Young women in pasties and thongs offered sexual favors alongside lattes at a proliferation of drive-in “bikini” espresso stands. OxyContin seemed to attract people with no criminal records and stable homes, jobs, and families. “They were a segment of society you would never have anticipated,” said Coleen St. Clair, a former Snohomish County prosecuting attorney who worked in the narcotics unit. Katie McKnight was smart and beautiful, a gifted athlete and the daughter of an Everett internist. A friend had given her a pill in 2006 during her first year at a local community college and, in the words of her mother, Mary, “that was it.” To buy pills, the young woman stole her sister’s graduation money, her parents’ checkbook and, twice, her mother’s engagement ring. She tried to snatch a woman’s purse in a grocery store parking lot, shoplifted and, for a time, worked as a stripper. Her father was familiar with OxyContin, but in his many years at a busy city clinic, he had never come across a patient who required a maximum-strength dose. He struggled to comprehend how his daughter was getting her hands on large numbers of 80-milligram tablets. “It seemed so completely outside the realm of possibility,” Robert McKnight said. When Lawson began dealing OxyContin in Everett, the 24-year-old had finished a year in prison for theft and her parents were doing everything they could to help her stay sober. They let her move back into her childhood bedroom, drove her to 12-step meetings and supported her efforts to find a job. But Katie relapsed, often spending nights at a motel where, the authorities said, dealers connected to Lawson sold 80s in the parking lot. On one car ride to a treatment center, her mother recalled, Katie studied her reflection in the visor mirror. After several long moments, she said quietly to herself, “I am so broken.” To Brandon Smith, who worked in marketing for Nintendo, OxyContin seemed less a dangerous narcotic than a status symbol. The popular crowd openly smoked the “green beans” on pieces of foil. “It was socially acceptable,” said Smith, who lived near Everett. “It was almost the new weed.” Smith became addicted, then got clean for a time. But in January 2009, at the age of 24, he relapsed. The flood of OxyContin into Everett had driven down prices and more people than ever were selling. By the summer of 2009, Smith had a 150-a-day habit. He’d been forced out of his job for stealing. He’d spent his 401(k) and sold his belongings. On a July afternoon, he was out of cash and going into withdrawal. He saw only one way out. He walked into a tanning salon near Everett and pointed a gun at a clerk. “Give me all your money,” he told her. He committed another robbery later that day. And the next. And the next. The cashiers didn’t notice the gun was a fake. What they did remember was that the man holding it was polite and apologized as he left. Two weeks into the 2009 spree, a local TV news program broadcast surveillance video of the “Tanning Salon Bandit.” Smith’s mother, watching at home, immediately recognized her son and phoned police. Officers surrounded him as he left his apartment the next morning. As they trained their weapons on him, he would later recall, he felt a brief sense of confusion. “It’s just me, guys,” he remembered thinking. “It’s just Brandon.” Smith confessed to at least 17 robberies. He was sentenced to 14 years in state prison, where he remains today. “I never meant to hurt anyone,” he told detectives. “One thing led to another.” Working OxyContin cases for the Snohomish Regional Drug Task Force, Det. Nicole Richardson spent many of her days talking to addicts and their families. “It impacted probably every aspect of the local community,” Richardson recalled. “A couple of individuals with the right connections in California flooded the Snohomish County market and unfortunately made a huge problem.” Investigators in Everett arrested Jevon Lawson in 2010, about the same time an L.A. drug task force was closing in on members of the Lake Medical ring. Federal prosecutors in L.A. won convictions of the clinic leaders while their counterparts in Seattle successfully prosecuted Lawson and several Californians supplying him with OxyContin. In Everett, Jevon “Goldie” Lawson bought bags of pills from L.A. gangmembers. He sold them to local dealers in Mill Creek and other places around the region. A defendant in one of the Washington state cases, a San Bernardino woman who pleaded guilty to laundering nearly 1 million as part of a conspiracy to supply OxyContin to Lawson, had purchased large quantities of OxyContin pills from Lake Medical, according to a DEA analyst’s report and an informant’s statement to authorities. The prosecutors did not allege in court that the OxyContin in Everett came specifically from the Lake Medical ring, and internal Purdue emails reviewed by The Times did not indicate that Purdue knew of a connection. Ultimately, the authorities in Everett built their case against Lawson and his associates with old-fashioned police work — surveilling drug spots, working informants and carrying out buy-and-bust operations. He pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in 2011 and is serving an 8-year prison term. In August 2010, two years after the OxyContin crisis began in Everett, Purdue introduced a new tablet that was more difficult to turn into powder. Addicts could no longer smoke the pills, but many of them moved to heroin, which is chemically similar and cheaper. Dealers who had been selling heroin to the same small group of drug users for years suddenly found themselves with a booming new clientele of, as one former dealer from Everett recalled, “upper- and middle-class children.” Today, heroin addiction is a public health crisis in Snohomish County; more than 40 residents fatally overdose each year. Katie McKnight had used heroin and other drugs when she couldn’t afford OxyContin, but after the pill reformulation, she became a full-time intravenous heroin user. In the fall of 2011, she was living in a squalid apartment with a drug dealer boyfriend and praying for sobriety. “God please give me some kind of way to get into detox to get the help I need to kick the dependence and have my life back,” she wrote in pink cursive in her journal on Oct. 1, 2011. “I seriously feel like I’m slowly dying. I need help!” Nineteen days later, she overdosed in her apartment. Her parents stood outside in the cold, misty darkness for an hour while paramedics worked to revive her. Finally, a police officer came out and told them their daughter was gone. The McKnights keep her ashes in an urn on their nightstand. Robert McKnight often wakes thinking about his daughter. “You kind of look back and ask yourself, “What if the OxyContin was not there?’” he said.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose departure inspired the song, \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Back? ?  The story is partially inspired by the Davies brothers' older sister Rose, who emigrated to Australia in 1964 with her husband Arthur Anning. Her departure devastated Ray Davies, and it inspired him to write the song \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Home\\", included on the 1966 album Face to Face. The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted. Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the story line and characters in depth, explaining in the liner notes for the album's LP release: Arthur Morgan ... lives in a London suburb in a house called Shangri-La, with a garden and a car and a wife called Rose and a son called Derek who's married to Liz, and they have these two very nice kids, Terry and Marilyn. Derek and Liz and Terry and Marilyn are emigrating to Australia. Arthur did have another son, called Eddie. He was named after Arthur's brother, who was killed in the battle of the Somme. Arthur's Eddie was killed, too—in Korea. Davies would later comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later \\"told me that he ... knew it [Arthur] had been partly inspired by him ... [it] reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, saying that he was flattered.\\" With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew (\\"Victoria\\", \\"Young and Innocent Days\\"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons (\\"Australia\\"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home (\\"Shangri-La\\"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War (\\"Mr. Churchill Says\\"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war (\\"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\\"), and the death of his brother in World War I (\\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", \\"Some Mother's Son\\").

The holiday crush   this year is estimated to be even heavier than before. Government officials suggest that Chinese people will take to the air, roads and railways 3.62 billion times over a 40-day period around the nation's most important holiday this year as people push their way home for family gatherings or to satisfy their new-found passion for travel. Getting tickets to all those would-be travelers is a _ challenge that tries your patience annually. And the pressure for the railway system is always the greatest. Railways are the transport of choice for low-cost long-distance travel, and that's where the ticketing system regularly falls down. Much of the criticism has focused on the railway's online purchasing system, which has been unable to keep pace with the huge demand and also failed to stop scalpers   from easily getting many of the hard-to-find tickets. Railway officials believed that online sales were the fairest way to get tickets for travelers, and told reporters that the public need to be patient. While by now the railway service is far from satisfying, efforts are being made to provide online identity checks that would reduce the ticket scalping problems, and the situation is expected to get better in a few years. Meanwhile, for those traveling by car, good news is that the country's extremely expensive highway tolls   will be removed for the period of the official holiday. Question: We can learn from the text that around the New Year holiday,   _   .

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation, we need to combine the terms with the variable (c) and the constant terms. We have: -6c - 10c - 2727 + 2279 = 0 First, let's combine the terms containing the variable c: -6c - 10c = -16c Now, let's put the constant terms together: -2727 + 2279 = -448 Now, we have a simplified equation: -16c - 448 = 0 Our next step is to isolate the variable (c). To do this, we need to move the constant term (which is currently subtracted) to the other side of the equation. Since the constant term is -448, we'll add 448 to both sides of the equation: -16c - 448 + 448 = 0 + 448 -16c = 448 Now, to find the value of c, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of c, which is -16: c = 448 / -16 c = -28 So, the solution to the given equation -6c - 10c - 2727 + 2279 = 0 is c = -28."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the topic that this about: The UK Conservative Party has some challenging environmental policies, though there are several glaring gaps. Available choices: a). World; b). Sports; c). Business; d). Science/Tech;","output":"d). Science/Tech The topic this passage relates to is Science/Tech, more specifically pertaining to environmental policies and sustainable development. The passage briefly discusses the environmental policies of the UK Conservative Party, highlighting that there are some significant gaps in their approach. Environment and sustainable development are considered part of the Science/Tech topic since they are deeply intertwined with advancements, innovations, and policy changes that involve scientific research, technological breakthroughs, and their implementation in various sectors. In recent years, environmental issues have gained increasing importance in the political agendas of various countries, and the UK is no exception. As a part of their strategy, the UK Conservative Party has pushed for the adoption of cleaner energy sources, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and increased focus on preserving natural resources. However, critics argue that these policies do not go far enough in addressing climate change and other pressing environmental challenges facing our planet today. Here are some of the key environmental policies under the UK Conservative Party: 1. The Climate Change Act: A significant cornerstone of the UK's environmental initiatives, the Climate Change Act (2008), mandates a legally binding reduction of at least 80% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to the levels in 1990 by the year 2050. The Conservative Party supports this ambitious goal and has expanded it with a new target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 2. Offshore Wind Energy Generation: The Conservative Party's environmental plan includes a focus on increasing the UK's offshore wind energy generation capacity. The party aims to have up to 40GW of installed offshore wind energy by 2030, which would provide clean energy for millions of households across the country. 3. Plastic Waste Reduction: To reduce plastic waste, the UK Conservative Party has introduced a ban on plastic straws, stirrers, and cotton buds since 2020. Moreover, the party pledged to work towards eradicating all single-use plastics in government departments and to encourage businesses to follow suit. Despite these policies, many critics argue that there are important gaps in the UK Conservative Party's environmental approach. Such gaps include: 1. Lack of Comprehensive Plans to Phase Out Fossil Fuels: While the Conservative's energy policies have focused on renewable sources, they lack concrete plans to phase out fossil fuels entirely, especially in sectors like transportation and heating. 2. Inadequate Focus on Nature Conservation: The UK’s environmental policies do not address issues like habitat loss, wildlife conservation, and biodiversity degradation as effectively as they should. The government's plans to promote economic growth and infrastructure development often overlook these aspects, which can pose long-term consequences for ecosystems and ultimately human well-being. 3. Limited Support for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Production Systems: The Conservative Party has been criticized for not taking strong enough stances on promoting sustainable agriculture and encouraging the reduction of food waste. Developing efficient policies to address unsustainable farming practices and pesticide overuse remains a challenge. To summarise, the passage is related to the Science/Tech topic, as it brings attention to the environmental policies implemented by the UK Conservative Party and highlights the need for significant improvements to address the pressing environmental challenges ahead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1910 Chinese expedition to Tibet or the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1910 was a military campaign of the Qing dynasty to establish direct rule in Tibet in early 1910. The expedition occupied Lhasa on February 12 and officially deposed the 13th Dalai Lama on the 25th. Qing rule of Tibet was established in the early 18th century after the 1720 Chinese expedition to Tibet, but it was essentially a protectorate rather than a direct rule. The actual rule also waned considerably with the gradual weakening of the Qing dynasty in the 19th century. After the British expedition to Tibet in 1904 and the Sino-British treaty in 1906, the Qing decided to establish direct rule over Tibet and thus sent such an expedition in 1910. As Professor Dawa Norbu stated, \\"The British military expedition and subsequent convention made the Chinese realize that their power in Tibet had disappeared. So, in 1910 China invaded Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.\\" In the late winter of 1910, the Manchu government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in Khams by Qing administrators, and fearing that the amban in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the Qing court. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for British India. However, the direct rule over Tibet proved short-lived: after the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution and the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1911-1912, Qing rule essentially ended in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet. All Qing forces left Tibet by the end of 1912. Answer this question based on the article: What happened first, China invaded Tibet or the 13 th Dali Lama fled to India?","output":"Based on the article, the 13th Dalai Lama fled to India after China invaded Tibet. The Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1910 happened first as they established their rule and occupied Lhasa on February 12th, officially deposing the 13th Dalai Lama on the 25th. This invasion prompted the 13th Dalai Lama to flee to British India when a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - ocean - southern europe - japan - rice paddy - italy","output":"Step 1: Analyze the question - The question tells us that John climbed a terrace from his balcony to sneak out and get an authentic pizza. Step 2: Consider the options - We need to find which option is most relevant to the context of the question.  Options: - ocean - southern Europe - Japan - rice paddy - Italy Step 3: Evaluate each option - I will now go through the options one by one and decide if they fit the question or not. Option 1: Ocean - This option is not related to the context of the question. John is trying to get an authentic pizza, and it's unlikely he would find that in the ocean. Therefore, we can eliminate this option. Option 2: Southern Europe - Southern Europe is known for having several countries that have a strong tradition of authentic pizza, such as Italy and Greece. This is a possible option regarding the context of the question, so I'll keep it. Option 3: Japan - Although Japan has adopted some Western food practices, it is not primarily known for authentic pizza. The question is asking specifically for an authentic pizza experience, so Japan is less likely to provide that, compared to other options. Thus, we can eliminate this option. Option 4: Rice paddy - A rice paddy is an agricultural area used for growing rice, and it has no relevance to the context of the question. John is looking for authentic pizza, not rice, so we can eliminate this option. Option 5: Italy - Italy is widely considered the birthplace of pizza, and it is renowned for having a rich tradition of authentic pizza. This option is highly relevant to the question, so I'll keep it. Step 4: Compare the remaining options - We are left with Southern Europe and Italy as possible options. Step 5: Make the final decision - Although both Southern Europe and Italy are possible locations to find authentic pizza, Italy is more specific and directly related to the pizza tradition. Therefore, the most suitable option in line with common sense to answer the question would be Italy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie plot title: The Cabin in the Woods Movie plot: The movie opens with a pair of middle-aged men walking through some kind of facility discussing mundane details about marriage and potential children, while a younger woman in a lab coat is trying to inform them about an incident at the Stockholm facility. The two men are not particularly concerned about what she is telling them. They mention that the facility in Japan will get the job done, and that their U.S. facility usually comes in second place. As they board a golf cart and drive off, the younger of the two men invites the older one to come over to his house for the upcoming weekend.The scene shifts to a room in a college town where Dana (Kristen Connolly) and Jules (Anna Hutchison) are talking about school. Apparently, Dana had an affair with one of her professors and it ended badly. Jules's boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth) walks in and throws a football at the girls. It flies out the window and Curt's friend Holden (Jesse Williams), a fix-up for Dana, catches it down below. The guys are there to pick up the girls for a long weekend at a lakeside cabin that Curt's cousin owns. Dana finishes packing and they all go downstairs to pack up the RV.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: For 3-7 days, track when, what, and how much you drink, and when and how much you urinate. After several days, you’ll likely start to notice clear patterns to your urination habits. Ideally, you should use a collection cup to record how much you urinate each time. Alternatively, you can just estimate the amount as “a lot,” “average,” and “a little.” After you’ve kept track of when you usually urinate, build a schedule around this data. To start out, try to set up the schedule so that you urinate every 2 to 2.5 hours during the daytime.  For example, schedule a “pee break” when you wake up (6:30 am), then when you arrive at work (9:00 am), then right before your lunch break (11:30 am), and so on. Do your best to stick to your schedule. Waiting 5-15 minutes can help stretch your bladder so that, over time, it can hold more urine. If you really need to go, however, just go. If you start your schedule by urinating every 2 hours, move to 2.25 hours between restroom visits the next week, then 2.5 hours the week after that. Your end goal should be to urinate every 3-4 hours. While the average adult urinates every 3-4 hours, this may not be manageable for you. Stretch out your pee breaks slowly, and stop when you seem to have reached your limit. To practice, start urinating, then make yourself stop the stream of urine by contracting your muscles. These are the muscles of your pelvic floor. Once you know what it feels like to contract the pelvic floor muscles, you can do Kegel exercises at other times throughout your day.  Try doing Kegel exercises during commercials while watching your favorite show, sitting at your desk, lying down, or filling up your car with gasoline—you can do them at almost any time, really. Try to do these exercises at least 3 times a day and at least 3-4 days a week. If you continue to need to urinate frequently despite your efforts to retrain your bladder, visit your doctor for a checkup. If you have to pee frequently and urgently, you may have an over-active bladder (OAB), which is a rather vaguely-defined medical condition that should be diagnosed by your doctor.  OAB can often be treated by making healthy lifestyle changes—like improving your diet, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, and quitting smoking—and possibly by taking medication.  Also speak to your doctor if you have any type of issues with incontinence—that is, releasing urine when you don’t intend to.","output":"The article provides a guide on how to create a urination schedule, practice bladder control through Kegel exercises, and when to consult a doctor for potential over-active bladder (OAB) or incontinence issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Question: What form of government did the place Palma was born in have at the time of her birth? Passage 1:Although originally proposed to the French space agency CNES, it was considered too complex and expensive for a single national programme. Its acceptance within the European Space Agency's scientific programme, in 1980, was the result of a lengthy process of study and lobbying. The underlying scientific motivation was to determine the physical properties of the stars through the measurement of their distances and space motions, and thus to place theoretical studies of stellar structure and evolution, and studies of galactic structure and kinematics, on a more secure empirical basis. Observationally, the objective was to provide the positions, parallaxes, and annual proper motions for some 100,000 stars with an unprecedented accuracy of 0.002 arcseconds, a target in practice eventually surpassed by a factor of two. The name of the space telescope, \\"Hipparcos\\" was an acronym for High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite, and it also reflected the name of the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who is considered the founder of trigonometry and the discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes (due to the Earth wobbling on its axis).  Passage 2:In 2017, it was announced that Ring of Honor had signed Gresham to a contract. In April 2017, Gresham teamed with Chris Sabin where they defeated Cheeseburger and Will Ferrara.

Consider also the belief that \\"the phone always rings when I'm in the shower. \\" If it does ring while you are in the shower, the event will stand out and be remembered.

In a wildly chaotic presidential election starring a tycoon-turned-reality-television-star from New York and a socialist from Vermont, is there room for another billionaire from Manhattan’s East Side? That is a central riddle facing former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg as he contemplates a third-party bid for the White House. Donald Trump’s resounding victories in South Carolina on Saturday and in Nevada’s caucuses Tuesday have solidified his status as the Republicans’ front-runner. On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s unexpected surge — and landslide win in New Hampshire — have kept him in the race even as Hillary Clinton has regained some momentum following her narrow victory in Nevada last weekend. What remains unknown is whether Bloomberg, 74, is willing to insert himself into a contest that remains unpredictable even as the field of candidates winnows. [In Nevada caucuses, Trump scores a third straight victory] Speaking on CBS's \\"Face the Nation”, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Sunday, Jan. 24, that he would welcome a third party run from Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City. (Reuters) Bloomberg went out of his way last week to bemoan a campaign he described as a “race to the extremes,” with candidates exploiting Americans’ loss of faith in a political system that is “corrupt, gridlocked and broken.” “That’s why you see the current candidates out there doing well, and not the conventional ones,” Bloomberg told a gathering at a Manhattan book party, an apparent reference to Trump and Sanders. Looming over the deliberations is the question of which party a Bloomberg candidacy would hurt more. With polls suggesting that Bloomberg would draw more Democratic than Republican voters, it makes little sense that Trump’s surge would prompt the former mayor to run. That said, Bloomberg’s viability may be strengthened if Clinton is damaged by a drawn-out nomination process. Bloomberg proved his capacity for defying naysayers 15 years ago, when he captured New York’s City Hall. But New York is not the United States, and it’s far from certain that swing-state voters would embrace a former Republican known for opposing guns, smoking and Big Gulp sodas. Nor is it clear that a measured, sober-toned business executive could command an electorate that so far has rewarded unceasing bombast over pragmatism. “You don’t solve problems by pointing fingers or making pie-in-the-sky promises,” Bloomberg told the gathering last week. “You solve them by bringing people together around common goals, promoting innovation, demonstrating independence and recognizing that compromise is not a bad word.” Bloomberg’s potential as a candidate is rooted in what the Gallup organization has identified as an ever-broadening swath of American voters who define themselves as independent and express dissatisfaction with both major political parties. For those voters, familiar names such as Clinton and Jeb Bush may seem like more of the same; meanwhile, Sanders, Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) may be too extreme, creating opportunity for Bloomberg, a former Democrat who turned Republican before declaring himself unaffiliated in 2007. “There is a broad constituency, and there will be a broader one still, given the polarization of this election,” said Douglas Schoen, Bloomberg’s pollster, who recently wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed article headlined, “Why Mike Bloomberg Can Win.” “He’d be the only one talking about bipartisan consensus and bipartisan decision-making and results-oriented policies,” Schoen said. “In a particularly unstable political situation like the one we’re in now, where there’s so much anger, it’s impossible to write off any credible candidate.” Bloomberg would face daunting challenges, not the least of which would be prevailing in enough states to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. American voters have never elected a third-party candidate to the presidency. In 1992, when he faced President George H.W. Bush and then-Gov. Bill Clinton, Ross Perot managed to draw 19 percent of the popular vote. But he did not win a single state. On a logistical level, Bloomberg’s campaign would need to quickly assemble an army to gather more than 900,000 signatures needed to qualify for the ballots in all 50 states, with a parade of rolling deadlines beginning this spring. “Every state has a different process for getting on the ballot, and it’s implicitly designed to make it very difficult,” said Reed Galen, a Republican strategist who advised Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “Is it plausible for him to get on the ballot? Yes. Easy? No.” Perhaps more crucially, Bloomberg would need to sell himself to a public that is largely unaware of him. A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month found that 56 percent of American voters had not heard of Bloomberg, the owner of the media company that bears his name. And a new poll this week from the Associated Press showed even more dire numbers — that a majority of voters of both parties would not even consider voting for him. Ed Rollins, the Republican strategist who advised Perot in 1992, recalled that the Texas billionaire’s appearances on Larry King’s CNN talk show galvanized a massive effort to get him on ballots across the country. Unlike the enthusiastic hordes propelling Trump and Sanders, the strategist said, Bloomberg “has none of that. He has a billion dollars, but there’s not a movement for him.” “My sense is that people telling Bloomberg to run are his New York dinner companions who are not happy with their choices,” Rollins said. “That’s not a constituency or a movement. “Arguably, he was a good manager of New York,” Rollins said. “But the vast majority of Americans don’t care about New York.” New York’s political establishment ridiculed Bloomberg when he ran for mayor in 2001. No matter his wealth, the argument went, a political novice running as a Republican could never win in a city awash in Democratic voters. “He was seen as another one of these rich guys who had nothing better to do,” said Bill Cunningham, a former Bloomberg adviser who recalled that his own friends said he was “crazy” for signing on with the mogul’s campaign. While the Democratic nominee, Mark Green, was weakened by a savage primary battle that year, he still held a formidable lead over Bloomberg as the general-election campaign began. Bloomberg’s willingness to spend 50 million of his own fortune on the campaign allowed him to inundate New Yorkers with television ads and mailings. His proven financial acumen became ever more attractive after the 9/11 terrorist attacks decimated New York’s economy. And an 11th-hour endorsement from then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani — exalted at that point for his handling of the 9/11 aftermath — was tantamount to a blessing. But Bloomberg also closed the gap by identifying and, over the course of many months, methodically appealing to 800,000 New Yorkers who were unaffiliated with either the Democratic or the Republican parties. It was an effort that his advisers tout as key to his narrow victory. For all that, said Kenneth Sherrill, a Hunter College political science professor: “Everyone was flabbergasted when he went over the top. No one expected it.” Still, Bloomberg’s success in New York may have little bearing on how he would fare in a presidential race, the outcome of which is determined not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. “What works in New York doesn’t necessarily work in the rest of the country,” said Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a nonpartisan newsletter covering state and federal campaigns. “He’s the guy who’s known for being against guns and soft drinks. Is that going to play in Fairbanks, Alaska, or the suburbs of Indianapolis?” Competing in a three-way race, Bloomberg’s progressive stances may not be problematic if he needs to win only a plurality against opponents such as Trump and Sanders. But his success would depend on independents remaining estranged from the two major parties by November — and on their willingness to expend their vote on a candidate whose viability is uncertain. Despite claims of political independence, voters’ “partisanship runs pretty deep,” Rothenberg said. “There are people who say they’re independent who aren’t really independent. They don’t want to throw their vote away.” Then there’s the question of which party a Bloomberg candidacy would damage more. A recent USA Today-Suffolk University poll showed Sanders in a close two-way contest against Trump but losing to the reality-television star if Bloomberg were on the ballot (Bloomberg placed third). Ultimately, Bloomberg’s challenge would be to identify those states in which he could win a plurality and put together the necessary electoral votes, an analysis Rothenberg undertook this month in a column in Roll Call. What Rothenberg concluded is that Bloomberg would have little chance in what Gallup and he have identified as the country’s 20 most conservative states, including Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina. Bloomberg would also face imposing challenges in the country’s most left-leaning states, such as Oregon, Vermont, Massachusetts, Michigan and Maryland. There’s little question, though, that Bloomberg’s candidacy would upend the current list of key swing states in the general election — states including Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, Colorado and Virginia. Where Bloomberg could find success, Rothenberg said, is in states such as California, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — all states that typically vote Democratic. Ohio is the only swing state on that list. And with so many states probably out of reach, Bloomberg “would have to run the table” in those and other states. “That won’t be easy. My bottom line is I don’t see it.” Trump’s and Sanders’s success may have made the art of political predictions risky, Rothenberg said, but the math isn’t adding up, “even for Michael Bloomberg with all his money.” “When you look at the puzzle,” he said, “it’s, at the least, very, very difficult.” Scott Clement contributed to this report.","output":"As Donald Trump gains momentum with more victories, there is still the question of whether former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, will contemplate a third-party bid for the White House. Many people are questioning the role of another billionaire in the presidential election, but with an unpredictable contest unfolding, even within a winnowing field of candidates, Bloomberg has not yet revealed his intentions. Although New York is not the United States, and it remains uncertain how receptive swing-state voters would be to Bloomberg's positions on certain issues, there is little doubt that Bloomberg's candidacy would alter the current list of key swing states in the general election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: New polling out over the past 24 hours suggests that Bernie Sanders is in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton in Iowa. Those results come as Clinton is upping her attacks on Sanders over his past votes on gun control measures, and Sanders appears to be getting more aggressive about Bill Clinton and his role in his wife's campaign. Oh, by the way, the Iowa caucuses are also only 21 DAYS AWAY! With so much going on in the Democratic primary, I reached out to Tad Devine, chief strategist for Sanders's campaign, to get his take on the state of the race — and how his candidate can win. Our conversation, conducted via email and edited only for grammar and flow, is below. FIX: NBC/Marist released a poll Sunday that showed Bernie within the margin of error in Iowa. Does that jibe with what you guys are seeing? And if so, what explains the momentum there? Devine: We believe the race has tightened in recent weeks in Iowa. I think a number of factors have led to the tightening. First, Bernie's message is very powerful: America has a rigged economy that is sending most of the new wealth to the top, and it's being held in place by a corrupt system of campaign finance. The Clinton campaign went on TV in Iowa (and New Hampshire) on Aug. 4. We started our media campaign Nov. 4. I think we have made up a lot of ground in both places since then. Also, Bernie is a very strong messenger for that message. He is credible and authentic, and people understand that these fights against powerful interests are the work of his life. FIX: Hillary is going hard at Bernie on guns. How do you guys respond? How vulnerable is your candidate on his past voting record on guns? And what does it tell you about the state of the race that she is attacking Sanders as aggressively as she is? Devine: When I saw Secretary Clinton call into \\"Hardball\\" on Friday night, I knew they must be very concerned about what was happening in the early states and elsewhere. Bernie Sanders earned his D- lifetime rating from the NRA, as well as his most recent rating of \\"F.\\" He has supported a ban on assault weapons since the late '80s, when he lost his first race for the House of Representatives based on his pledge to ban those weapons. He has supported background checks as well, and supports a law preventing straw purchases of guns. Bernie supports President Obama's executive actions on guns, and the president's efforts to take on the gun lobby. The truth is, while there are past differences on some gun legislation, going forward there are not big differences on this issue. That is why I don't think the gun issue will change the outcome of the race. FIX: Bernie has long pledged not to attack Clinton (or the Clintons) on personal matters. But at a town hall in Iowa late last week, he said that what Bill Clinton did was \\"totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.” Isn’t that a violation of his no-attack principle? If not, why not? Devine: I think if people saw the question he was asked at that town hall meeting and the context, they would not view that part of one sentence you cited as a \\"negative attack.\\" He was asked a question and gave an answer which, in part, is not dissimilar to what almost all Democrats were saying at the time of President Clinton's impeachment trial — that what the president did was wrong. Bernie also stated that he was running against Hillary Clinton, not Bill Clinton, and has made clear repeatedly that he is not interested in making President Clinton's past an issue in the campaign. Bernie wants to talk about the issues that affect the lives of people today in America. FIX: Let’s say Hillary wins Iowa. Bernie wins New Hampshire. What do you say to critics who insist that Sanders has no wins beyond Feb. 9 on the calendar? Where can he win next? And how, given how much he has struggled to win over black and Hispanic voters from Clinton? Devine: Fix readers may remember Walter Mondale's campaign against Gary Hart when Senator Hart won the New Hampshire primary. I do because I was counting delegates for Mondale. The momentum that comes from an early victory is huge, and I believe that Bernie's campaign is in position to take advantage of that momentum. We have strong campaigns on the ground in Nevada and South Carolina, and we have been on radio in Nevada since November and on TV in Nevada since late December. (The Clinton campaign joined us on TV in Nevada on Friday). We have also been on radio in South Carolina since November. So I think we can compete and win in a number of states, like Massachusetts, Colorado, Minnesota and Vermont on March 1st and elsewhere as we move into big battlegrounds like Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. As to support from Latinos and African Americans, I think that support is growing by the day. For example, in the most recent Field poll in California, Bernie's support with Latinos grew from 3.2 percent in May to 35.3 percent in the poll they released last week. And that all occurred in a state where we have had no paid media. I think it bodes well for our potential to win substantial support from Latinos, African Americans and others as they come to know more about Bernie and his plans for their future. FIX: Finish this sentence: Bernie Sanders is a better general election candidate than Hillary Clinton for Democrats because ____________. Now explain. Devine: He can build a broad-based coalition that will elect Democrats up and down the ballot. Bernie, alone among Democrats, can build the kind of coalition that Barack Obama built in 2008. It begins with young people who are supporting him as they did Obama. And it continues with independents. Gallup today released its latest survey with the headline \\"Democratic, Republican identification near historical lows.\\" Independents, for the fifth consecutive year in the Gallup survey, comprise over 40 percent of the American electorate. We are already seeing general election polling that recognizes Bernie as by far the strongest candidate for the Democrats [because of] his core strength with independents. The truth is if we do not have a nominee who can win support from independents and even some Republicans, we will lose. Bernie won 25 percent of the Republican vote in his last reelection to the Senate (with 71 percent of the total vote). Also, so many people who now feel left out and left behind will, we believe, be motivated to participate in the process because Bernie alone speaks with conviction and authority to the concerns that are at the center of their lives.

He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US. A:","output":"The last name of the person who recorded Bryter Layter is Drake.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Clear your mind of the stress leftover from your job.  If you do get fired, you’ll have plenty of time to focus on what makes you happy.  You’ll get to learn new things about yourself and reassess your career goals.  You may find that you want to do something entirely different than the position you were let go from.  Focus on your health.  Make an exercise routine.  Adopt a healthy diet.  Get plenty of sleep. Have new experiences.  You can enjoy inexpensive adventures like going hiking. Learn new skills you never had time for while you were working. Enjoy some quality time with your family.  Being overly focused on work can make you forget the things in life that are really important.  If you get fired, you’ll have a lot of extra time to connect with your kids, your spouse, your parents and whoever else is an important part of your life. Many of the most successful people in our country have been fired.  Sometimes, being fired from a position that doesn’t fit you can lead to you finding your true calling.  J.K. Rowling was fired from her day job as a secretary and was even homeless for a short period of time before writing the “Harry Potter” books. Michael Bloomberg was fired from an investment bank and used his severance package to start his financial data company.  Bloomberg L.P. is now one of the most successful companies on the planet. Having constant fear that you’ll be fired can be very detrimental to your self-esteem.  When you’re out of that job, you’ll get a chance to remember how great of a person you really are.  The only thing that changes when you get fired is your employment status.  You’ll find that you’re still the same intelligent, capable person you were before you worked there and eventually another company will agree.","output":"The article encourages embracing the potential positives of being fired, such as personal growth, focusing on health, spending time with loved ones, and the opportunity to find one's true calling, with examples of successful individuals who have been fired and gone on to greater achievements."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Serenity Movie plot: In the 26th century, humanity has left an overpopulated Earth to colonize a new solar system. The central planets formed the Alliance and won a war against the outer planet Independentsâthose refusing to join the Alliance. River Tam (Summer Glau) is coercively conditioned by Alliance scientists into a psychic assassin. She is rescued by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). During her training, River inadvertently read the minds of several officers and learned top government secrets. Consequently, a top Alliance agent known only as the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is tasked with recapturing her. The siblings have found refuge aboard the transport spaceship Serenity with Captain Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), first mate Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres), pilot Hoban \\"Wash\\" Washburne (Alan Tudyk), mercenary Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin), and mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite). Despite Simon's objections, Mal brings River on a bank robbery where they are attacked by savage and cannibalistic Reavers. They escape, but Simon decides he and River will leave Serenity at the next port. Once there, however, a television commercial causes River to attack numerous bar patrons, and Mal takes the siblings back aboard the ship. The crew contacts reclusive hacker Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz), who discovers a subliminal message designed to trigger River's mental conditioning. He notes River whispered \\"Miranda\\" before attacking and warns that someone else saw the footage. Mal is invited to visit Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), a former Serenity occupant. Despite knowing she is held hostage as a trap, Mal goes to rescue her. The Operative confronts Mal, promising to let him go free if he turns over River. Mal refuses and escapes with Inara.

Some areas received more rain in a day than had fallen all summer. Waco, Texas, where temperatures hit at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit 78 days this year, received 5.83 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas got 1.37 inches of rain, while San Antonio received 3.06 inches -- a record for the date. The weather service forecast rainfall amounts over the central and southern Plains of 1-3 inches per hour, with totals of more than 10 inches possible in some places by Monday morning. \\"This should put a significant dent in the ongoing severe drought over portions of the area, but this amount of rain in a short period of time could also lead to possible flash flooding across northern Texas and Oklahoma,\\" the weather service said. It added that drought conditions are expected to persist because of the magnitude of the shortage. With much of the state in an exceptional drought, Texas has been scarred by one of the worst fire seasons in memory. Since wildfire season started in November, more than 3.8 million of the state's 167.5 million acres have burned in some 24,000 fires, according to the Texas Forest Service. Roughly 2,800 homes were destroyed. \\"What the state needs is several widespread rainfall events over several months,\\" the weather service said. Heavy rains and slippery field conditions at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington forced the postponement Sunday of the second game of the American League Championship Series. Weather permitting, the Texas Rangers and Detroit Tigers will make up the game Monday afternoon. CNN's Jacqui Jeras contributed to this report.

Before she vanished, Harriet would give Henrik a pressed flower for his birthday every year, a tradition that he believes has been continued by the person responsible for her disappearance. Convinced that someone in the family murdered Harriet, Henrik will allow Blomkvist to conduct his investigation out of a cottage on the island, under the guise of writing a memoir about Henrik and his life. Blomkvist is reluctant to accept, until Henrik offers him incriminating evidence that would validate his claims...

Plot title: The Sacrifice Movie plot: The film opens on the birthday of Alexander (Erland Josephson), an actor who gave up the stage to work as a journalist, critic, and lecturer on aesthetics. He lives in a beautiful house with his actress wife Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood), stepdaughter Marta (Filippa FranzÃ©n), and young son, \\"Little Man\\", who is temporarily mute due to a throat operation. Alexander and Little Man plant a tree by the sea-side, when Alexander's friend Otto, a part-time postman, delivers a birthday card to him. When Otto asks, Alexander mentions that his relationship with God is \\"nonexistent\\". After Otto leaves, Adelaide and Victor, a medical doctor and a close family friend who performed Little Man's operation, arrive at the scene and offer to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor's car. However, Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, Alexander first recounts how he and Adelaide found this lovely house near the sea by accident, and how they fell in love with the house and surroundings, but then enters a bitter tirade against the state of modern man. As Tarkovsky wrote, Alexander is weary of \\"the pressures of change, the discord in his family, and his instinctive sense of the threat posed by the relentless march of technology\\"; in fact, he has \\"grown to hate the emptiness of human speech\\".[2] The family, as well as Victor and Otto, gather at Alexander's house for the celebration. Their maid Maria leaves, while nurse-maid Julia stays to help with the dinner. People comment on Maria's odd appearances and behavior. The guests chat inside the house, where Otto reveals that he is a student of paranormal phenomena, a collector of \\"inexplicable but true incidences.\\" Just when the dinner is almost ready, the rumbling noise of low-flying jet fighters interrupts them, and soon after, as Alexander enters, a news program announces the beginning of what appears to be all-out war, and possibly nuclear holocaust. In despair, he vows to God to sacrifice all he loves, even Little Man, if this may be undone.... My question: Who does Alexander run to for help?

The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing.

How to supervise hamsters outside of the cage  Check for escape routes and problem areas first.  Hamsters are really fast and are often hard to catch, so be sure you have a good grip on it before you lift it out of its cage. Move the hamster quickly to the area where you want it to spend time out of its cage. Pick from:  - When handling hamsters, don't be shocked (and don't drop them) if they nibble or bite you. Let your hamster out of its cage carefully.;  - If there are any abandoned areas, close off them. Identify all the old stalls and ground floor cages in your yard.;  - Don't handle it too roughly, or you could injure it. Determine if your hamster has an owner.;  - Scrape or scoop up loose dirt and soiled bedding. You can also remove old toys from the cage first, but ensure all dirty toys are thrown away before placing them back in the cage.; Answer:","output":"When handling hamsters, don't be shocked (and don't drop them) if they nibble or bite you.

Detecting a cruise ship close by, the ship alters course as disembodied voices announce in German, \\"Battle Stations! Enemy in sight!\\" Aboard the cruise ship, the prickly Captain Ashland is making his final voyage, attended by his replacement, Captain Trevor Marshall, who has brought along his family. The freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn. Despite Ashland's best efforts, the charging freighter collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. (Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivorsâMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morganâare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck.

Question: What do the villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking? Movie title: The First Grader Movie plot: In 2003, a disc jockey announces over a Kenyan radio station that the government is offering free primary school education to all natives who can prove citizenship with a birth certificate. Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the Mau Mau Uprising against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Marugeâs education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility. Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Marugeâs case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant.

As you mentioned, apart from a little rain, the day turned out quite well, which could have positively impacted the animals' behavior and willingness to be present in their enclosures or outdoor spaces designated for them. Option A (None of the above) can be disregarded as it suggests that none of the listed reasons were responsible for the visibility of the animals. Option C (The animals were forced to be outdoors for the tourists) might not be the best explanation, as zoos typically prioritize animal welfare and do not force animals to be outdoors if it is not in their best interest. Modern zoos take into account the natural habitats and preferences of animals and do their best to mimic these conditions. Furthermore, forcing animals to be guests' entertainment tends to stress them, leading to negative consequences for their overall health and well-being. Option D (The animals were in their mating season) might be a factor in some cases as certain animals exhibit increased activity and visibility during mating season. However, this is likely to only apply to a specific subset of animals, rather than to the majority present at the Zoo. Moreover, mating seasons differ among animal species, making it unlikely to be the primary reason for the animals' visibility during your visit. In conclusion, the favorable weather conditions on the day of your visit to the Zoo (Option B) were most likely the primary reason for the high visibility of the animals. The comfortable weather might have encouraged the animals to venture out of their shelters and engage more in their enclosures, giving visitors an opportunity to see and appreciate them up close."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: (CNN) In response to recent guidance by the American Medical Association against the use of powerful LED lights, cities such as Phoenix; Lake Worth, Florida; and 25 towns in Connecticut are now opting for street lamps with lower color temperatures, meaning less blue light emission. The association's policy statement, released in June, suggested that LED lights with color temperatures higher than 3000 Kelvin had adverse effects on health, including eye damage and disrupted sleep patterns. The warning was aimed at large cities, where the standard color temperature for LED street lights is 5000K to 6000K. Lights with high color temperatures release more blue light, which cause more glare and discomfort to the eyes, according to the association.The American Medical Association recommends LED lights with less blue lightSome cities are replacing street lamps to improve public health   Question:Longcore suggests using high-_ in areas known for criminal activity and less intense lights elsewhere.

We do this by subtracting 135 from both sides: 15*d + 135 - 135 = 0 - 135 15*d = -135 Step 3: Solve for d: Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 15 to get the value of d: (15*d) / 15 = -135 / 15 d = -9 Thus, the solution to the equation 7*d + 8*d + 733 - 598 = 0 is d = -9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The primary difference between ASP.NET and .NET lies in their application and usage within the realm of programming.  1. Application and Purpose:    ASP.NET is a web development framework used for creating web applications, and it is a part of the .NET platform. It provides a programming model and infrastructure to develop robust and scalable applications.      On the other hand, .NET (also known as .NET Framework) is a software development platform developed by Microsoft. It provides a controlled programming environment where software can be developed, installed and executed on Windows-based operating systems. 2. Extensibility:    ASP.NET is built around the .NET Framework, hence, it includes all features that the .NET Framework offers. It is not a standalone entity but a component within the overarching .NET framework.         Conversely, .NET is a larger, more comprehensive framework that can facilitate the development of different types of applications – not just web-based applications. It supports the development of desktop applications, mobile applications, and IoT devices as well. 3. Programming Languages:    With ASP.NET, you can use languages like C#, VB.NET, and J# among others, specifically for web application development.     The .NET Framework is language-independent, meaning you can develop applications in several .NET languages such as C#, VB.NET, F#, and more. It provides a broad range of functionalities and supports various programming models.  In summary, .NET is a general-purpose development platform, while ASP.NET is a part of .NET designed specifically for building dynamic web sites, web applications, and web services."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes.

As Sam and Alex approached the school track, they were excited to try out the new whistle they've bought. They knew Coach Thompson had a knack for collecting sports gear, but little did they know that he already owned a whistle. It had been a tough decision between the whistle and the stop watch at the store, but ultimately, they thought the whistle would be a more useful investment for the team's day-to-day practice sessions. Coach Thompson appreciated the thoughtfulness of his students, but with a gentle grin, revealed his own whistle dangling from a lanyard around his neck. His well-worn whistle had been with him throughout his entire coaching career, and he was not ready to part with it just yet. Sam and Alex exchanged embarrassed glances but decided they could still put their newly bought whistle to good use. Instead of letting their purchase go to waste, Sam and Alex approached some of the younger athletes on the track team who were running their laps. They taught the newcomers various whistle signals that corresponded to different running drills, strategies, and tactics. The whistle's crisp and clear sound was easy to hear above the sounds of the athletes' pounding feet and the winds that swept across the track. As the weeks went by, the team nicknamed Sam and Alex \\"The Whistle Duo.\\" Their commitment to helping the younger athletes quickly made them into unofficial assistant coaches, and the progress of the team members was evident. The track team's performance improved significantly, owing largely to the efforts of the Whistle Duo and the communication system they've established via whistle signals. The day finally arrived for the state championships. Coach Thompson entered his team into several relay races, confident that the well-trained athletes would excel. The young runners, who had once been inexperienced and struggling, now began to shine under the persistent guidance of their dedicated mentors. As the relay races were about to start, Coach Thompson assembled the team for a few final words. It was then that he added a surprising new report to the state championships--Sam and Alex were to become official assistant coaches for the varsity track and field team. The friends were thrilled; their roles would now contribute even more to the team’s success. As the races began, Coach Thompson stood on the sidelines, occasionally blowing his trusty whistle. At the same time, Sam and Alex offered precise instructions and encouragement to the athletes, using their own whistle to signal specific strategies and adjustments to the runners. The state championships were full of intense competition, but the team's synchronicity, strengthened by the whistle communication system, pushed them one step ahead of the rest. In the end, the team secured a historic victory. As the athletes lifted the state championship trophy, Coach Thompson beamed with pride, looking over at Sam and Alex, knowing that the team's success was thanks, in no small part, to their shared zeal for coaching and a whistle that had once seemed like a redundant purchase."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The answer is a little unclear but it seems they consider all the scores together and create a shortlist after considering everyone. Second, you asked if both questions mean the same thing.

Answer the following question: What was the name of the album that had it's press tour interrupted after Bono was seriously inured in a bicycle accident in Central Park on 16 November 2014?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign. Songs of Innocence recalls the group members' youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical...

Translate to English","output":"Everyone agrees that fundamentalism can take on various forms. Fundamentalism, as a concept, spans across different spheres like religion, politics, and culture. It is essential to understand the various ways that fundamentalism manifests itself, as well as its underlying motives, to grasp its impact on individuals and society as a whole. In the religious context, fundamentalism often refers to an unwavering adherence to a set of beliefs or principles that are considered central to a particular faith. People who embrace religious fundamentalism may view their interpretation of their faith as the only valid one, and they may reject any attempt to modernize or adapt their beliefs. This can sometimes cause tension within religious communities, as well as between adherents of different faiths. One of the most evident cases of religious fundamentalism in recent history is that of Islamic fundamentalist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Both groups have attempted to establish control over territories in the Middle East and elsewhere, implement strict Islamic law, and execute acts of terror in the pursuit of their goals. Similarly, Christian fundamentalism, though not as violent, can be observed in the United States and other countries, where conservative Christians seek to enforce their views on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Political fundamentalism, on the other hand, is characterized by an unwavering commitment to a specific ideology, often accompanied by a rejection of alternative viewpoints and an unwillingness to compromise. In the extreme, this can lead to authoritarian regimes that suppress dissent and enforce their ideology on the population at large. Examples of political fundamentalism can be found in global history, including the Communist regimes of the Soviet Union and China, and the fascist governments in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy during World War II. Cultural fundamentalism, or ethnocentrism, refers to the belief that one's own culture is superior to others and should be preserved from outside influences. Advocates of cultural fundamentalism may resist the integration of immigrants and advocate for policies that place their own culture above others. In some cases, cultural fundamentalism can lead to nationalist movements that seek to establish a nation state with a single dominant culture. Throughout history, different cultural fundamentalist groups have emerged, such as white supremacists in the United States advocating for preservation of so-called white culture, or the Hutu-Tutsi ethnic conflict in Rwanda. In conclusion, fundamentalism is a multifaceted phenomenon that can emerge in various domains of human life, such as religion, politics, and culture. It often involves a rigid adherence to a set of beliefs or values and a refusal to entertain competing perspectives. This can arise in response to perceived threats to one's identity, society, or way of life. Undeniably, fundamentalism has the potential to cause division, conflict, and even violence due to its propensity to resist change and suppress dissenting opinions. Therefore, it is crucial to promote understanding, tolerance, and dialogue to mitigate the impact of fundamentalism on individuals and societies alike."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barkley was born and raised in Leeds, Alabama, ten miles (16 km) outside Birmingham, and attended Leeds High School. As a junior, Barkley stood 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and weighed 220 pounds (100 kg). He failed to make the varsity team and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and earned a starting position on the varsity as a senior. Barkley played collegiate basketball at Auburn for three seasons. Although he struggled to control his weight, he excelled as a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year. He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with dunks and blocked shots that belied his lack of height and overweight frame. It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and, instead of passing, dribble the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a two-handed dunk. His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname \\"The Round Mound of Rebound\\".  During his college career, Barkley played the center position, despite being shorter than the average center. His height, officially listed as 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), is stated as 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) in his book, I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It. He became a member of Auburn's All-Century team and still holds the Auburn record for career field goal percentage with 62.6%. He received numerous awards, including Southeastern Conference (SEC) Player of the Year (1984), three All-SEC selections and one Second Team All-American selection. Later, Barkley was named the SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the Birmingham Post-Herald.  In Barkley's three-year college career, he averaged 14.8 points on 68.2% field goal shooting, 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.7 blocks per game. In 1984, he made his only appearance in the NCAA Tournament and finished with 23 points on 80% field goal shooting, 17 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocks. Auburn retired Barkley's No. 34 jersey on March 3, 2001.  In 2010, Barkley admitted that he asked for, and had been given, money from sports agents during his career at Auburn. Barkley called the sums he had requested from agents as being \\"chump change\\", and went on to say, \\"Why can't an agent lend me some money and I'll pay him back when I graduate?\\" According to Barkley, he paid back all of the money he had borrowed after signing his first NBA contract.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how can you generate heat?\\" is \\"electrical energy\\", given that  mammals can generate heat with their muscles? A:","output":"While \\"electrical energy\\" is one method of generating heat, it may not be considered as the most comprehensive or \\"right\\" answer to the question \\"how can you generate heat?\\" as there are various ways to produce heat, including through biological means, chemical reactions, and physical processes. Here are some common methods to generate heat: 1. Electrical energy: Passing an electric current through a resistive object (like heating coils or electric stoves) can produce heat. This is known as Joule heating or resistive heating. 2. Mammals using their muscles: Warm-blooded animals can generate heat through metabolic processes that include muscle contractions (shivering) and brown fat (non-shivering thermogenesis). 3. Chemical reactions: Reactions such as combustion (burning of fuels like gasoline, coal, or wood) or exothermic reactions (where heat is produced as a byproduct) generate heat. 4. Friction: When two objects rub against each other, the kinetic energy is converted into heat. This is the principle behind starting a fire using sticks or generating heat by rubbing hands together. 5. Nuclear reactions: Fission (where large atomic nuclei split) and fusion (where small atomic nuclei combine) release enormous amounts of heat in nuclear power plants or stars like the Sun. 6. Solar radiation: The sun radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic waves, which, when absorbed by objects on Earth, can cause them to heat up. 7. Geothermal heat: The Earth's core continuously generates heat due to radioisotope decay, which can be used for heating purposes through geothermal power plants. Considering the variety of ways heat can be generated, a more comprehensive answer to the question would be \\"Heat can be generated through various processes, including electrical energy, metabolic processes in mammals, chemical reactions, friction, nuclear reactions, solar radiation, and geothermal activity.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: During the Hungnam evacuation, about 193 shiploads of UN Command forces and matériel (approximately 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan. The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers.

(CNN) -- He may be a long way from the football field, but Pele at least is back to talking and getting better at a Sao Paulo, Brazil, hospital.  The city's Albert Einstein Hospital issued a statement Saturday saying the football legend -- born Edson Arantes do Nascimento -- was improving but still in intensive care battling an illness.  Pele is lucid, talking and responding to antibiotics, the hospital said. He remains on temporary dialysis, which was a reason he was moved to the ICU in the first place, because the machine he needed was there.  The hospital issued a second statement later Saturday, indicating that Pele continues to recover and that doctors plan to take him off dialysis early Sunday.  Earlier this week, the 74-year-old was admitted to the medical facility -- the same place he recently underwent surgery to remove kidney stones -- for a urinary tract infection.  The athletic icon had one kidney removed during this days as a player, his aide, Jose Fornos Rodrigues, told CNN.  Pele tweeted Thursday that he was looking forward to spending the holidays with family and starting \\"the new year with renewed health, with many international trips planned.\\"  \\"I am blessed to receive your love and support,\\" Pele said, \\"and thank God this is nothing serious.\\"  Known as \\"The Black Pearl\\" and simply \\"The King,\\" Pele is one of the best known names in all of sports.

Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.  - The Northern Mariana Islands, officially the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI Carolinian: \\"Commonwealth Téél Falúw kka Efáng llól Marianas\\"), is an insular area and commonwealth of the United States consisting of fifteen islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.

The longtime Dean of the United States Senate served as its president pro tempore and chairman of both its Rules and Administration and Appropriations committees . He was a member of the Democratic Party . Having earned a reputation as a reclamation expert early in his congressional career , Hayden consistently backed legislation dealing with public lands , mining , reclamation , and other projects affecting the Western United States . In addition , he played a key role in creating the funding formula for the federal highway system . President John F. Kennedy said of Hayden , \`\` Every Federal program which has contributed to the development of the West -- irrigation , power , reclamation -- bears his mark , and the great Federal highway program which binds this country , together , which permits this State to be competitive east and west , north and south , this in large measure is his creation . '' Known as the \`\` Silent Senator '' , Hayden rarely spoke on the Senate floor . Instead his influence came from committee meetings and Senate cloakroom discussions where his comments were given a respect comparable to canon law . A colleague said of him , \`\` No man in Senate history has wielded more influence with less oratory , '' while the Los Angeles Times wrote that Hayden had \`\` assisted so many projects for so many senators that when old Carl wants something for his beloved Arizona , his fellow senators fall all over themselves giving him a hand . They 'd probably vote landlocked Arizona a navy if he asked for it . ''  - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America.

Denmark is still neutral, but (Danish) Captain Andersen (Conrad Veidt) and his freighter Helvig are stopped in the English Channel by Lt. Commanders Ashton (Joss Ambler) and Ellis (Harold Warrender) for a cargo inspection in a British Contraband Control Port. He receives two shore passes for himself and his First Officer Axel Skold (Hay Petrie) to dine with Ashton and Ellis, but the passes (and Helvig's motorboat) are stolen by passengers Mrs. Sorensen (Valerie Hobson) and talent scout Mr. Pidgeon (Esmond Knight). From a cut-out newspaper train schedule, Andersen is able to figure out they are taking a train to London and catches up with them; but, when the train arrives in the blacked-out metropolis, he is only able to hold on to Sorensen. He invites her to dine at the restaurant of Skold's brother Erik (also Hay Petrie).

Given the below context:  After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The portion of the marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a perfectly competitive market. (the portion of the MC curve below its intersection with the AVC curve is not part of the supply curve because a firm would not operate at price below the shutdown point) This is not true for firms operating in other market structures. For example, while a monopoly \`\`has'' an MC curve it does not have a supply curve. In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller's willing and able to supply at each price -- for each price, there is a unique quantity that would be supplied. The one-to-one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly. With a monopoly, there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity. It all depends on the shape and position of the demand curve and its accompanying marginal revenue curve. Can we conclude that is the marginal cost curve the supply curve?","output":"Sure, little buddy! Let me explain it in a simple way. In a perfectly competitive market, where businesses are like players in a big game, each one tries to offer the best deal. These businesses are called firms.  Now, imagine you have a lemonade stand. The more lemonade you make, the higher the cost you need to pay to make it. This is called the \\"marginal cost\\", or the cost of making one more glass of lemonade. The \\"supply curve\\" shows how much of something, like lemonade, the businesses want to sell based on the price people pay for it. In this big game, players or firms are more likely to make and sell lemonade when they can cover their costs, which means they make enough money to stay in the game. So, at that point, the marginal cost curve is like the supply curve for those firms. But, not all businesses play in the perfectly competitive market. Some are like the king of their own game, and they're called \\"monopolies\\". For them, it's not as simple as their marginal cost curve being their supply curve. They can set different prices for the same amount of their \\"thing\\", so we can't say their marginal cost curve is like their supply curve."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

Write highlights for this article: Norwich produced an astonishing second-half fightback to stun Cardiff and claim a 4-2 victory at Cardiff City Stadium. The Canaries, unbeaten since their opening day defeat at Wolves, were awful during the first half and deservedly trailed to goals from Joe Ralls and Aron Gunnarsson. But quickfire strikes from Martin Olsson and Wes Hoolahan levelled matters early in the second half, before Michael Turner and substitute Cameron Jerome finished the job. Norwich's second-half fightback saw the Canaries claw back from a two-goal deficit to win 4-2. Four goals in Norwich's second-half fightback saw the Canaries win 4-2 against Cardiff City.

Goals: Ralls (4), Gunnarsson (22) Norwich: Ruddy, Martin, Turner, Hooiveld, Olsson, Tettey, Johnson, Lafferty (Jerome 46), Hoolahan (O'Neil 84), Redmond (Garrido 88), Grabban. Subs (not used): Odjidja-Ofoe, Whittaker, Murphy, Rudd,. Bookings: Lafferty, Turner. Goals: Olsson (54), Hoolahan (58), Turner (71), Jerome (87) Such an outcome had looked highly unlikely as Cardiff, challenged to prove their Championship title credentials by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, raced out of the traps. Inside a minute Kenwyne Jones had seen his goalwards glancing header hacked clear, but there was no reprieve for Norwich in the fourth minute. Ralls seized on Turner's loose pass and drove beyond Alex Tettey to send a left-footed drive into the bottom corner. It was the young midfielder's second league goal for the Bluebirds, almost three years after his first. The visitors were all at sea although Kyle Lafferty almost levelled with a curling strike which David Marshall did well to punch away to safety. Norwich fell further behind in the 22nd minute. Jones played in Anthony Pilkington down the right, and his cross was expertly tucked home by Gunnarsson. Having dominated the opening half an hour Cardiff sowed the seeds of their own downfall by surrendering the initiative during the final 15 minutes of the half and, aside from one excellent John Ruddy stop to deny Federico Macheda's volley, they were not to regain it. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson doubles Cardiff's lead in the first half as Norwich struggled to get a foothold. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson runs away in celebration after doubling Cardiff's lead over a frustrated Norwich side. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson is joined by Anthony Pilkington as the pair celebrate going 2-0 up. Cardiff let their 2-0 lead from the first half slip as a disastrous second 45 minutes saw Norwich net four times. The loss of Fabio to injury weakened the left-side of the Cardiff defence, with Declan John on in his place, and Norwich took full advantage. Firstly Hoolahan was given far too much room to get a ball into Lewis Grabban in the 54th minute. The in-form striker could not turn Sean Morrison but the ball fell kindly for Olsson to slot home from close range, on the Swede's return to the side after his ban for pushing referee Simon Hooper. Four minutes later Norwich were level. Nathan Redmond evaded Ralls and John to deliver a pinpoint cross for Jerome to power a header straight at Marshall, who could do nothing as Hoolahan gleefully dispatched the follow-up. Cardiff were rocked and they fell behind with 19 minutes to play. Tettey found space down the Norwich right and Russell Martin's mis-hit shot was turned in by Turner as Marshall appealed in vain for offside. The Bluebirds responded with Whittingham twice working Ruddy, and Turner being fortunate to only receive a booking after bringing down Nicky Maynard with the substitute through on goal. But former Cardiff striker Cameron Jerome put the result beyond doubt three minutes from time. Splintering the hosts' offside trap to round Marshall before tucking home. Neil Adams celebrates Norwich's 4-2 win at the end of the game after clawing back from 2-0 down at half time.","output":"In an exciting Championship match at the Cardiff City Stadium, Norwich City produced an astonishing second-half fightback to claim a 4-2 victory over Cardiff City. Despite an underwhelming performance by Norwich in the first half, the Canaries managed to turn things around with an impressive display after the break.  Cardiff kicked off the game in full force and took the lead in the fourth minute with a goal from young midfielder Joe Ralls. They continued to dominate the first half as Aron Gunnarsson doubled their lead in the 22nd minute with a fine finish, giving Cardiff a comfortable 2-0 lead going into halftime. However, Norwich emerged from the break with renewed energy and determination. Quickfire strikes from Martin Olsson in the 54th minute and Wes Hoolahan in the 58th helped the Canaries level the score at 2-2. As the game approached its final stages, Michael Turner put Norwich in the lead in the 71st minute, and substitute Cameron Jerome sealed the victory with a goal in the 87th minute. Norwich's comeback was notably aided by Cardiff's loss of Fabio to injury, which weakened their left-side defence. Additionally, Norwich's tactical adjustments and efficient use of substitutes contributed to their stunning comeback. This victory extends Norwich's unbeaten run after their opening day defeat at Wolves, while Cardiff will be left to rue their inability to hold on to a two-goal lead. The final score was: Cardiff City 2, Norwich City 4. Goals for Cardiff came from Joe Ralls (4) and Aron Gunnarsson (22), while Norwich's goals were scored by Martin Olsson (54), Wes Hoolahan (58), Michael Turner (71), and Cameron Jerome (87)."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology? ?  The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical...

Choices: (I) yes; (II) it is not possible to tell; (III) no;","output":"(I) Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"Usually, a limited edition of anything has some value later.\\" This claim is supported by the logic that limited edition items tend to hold or increase in value over time due to their rarity, exclusivity, and collectible nature. There are several reasons why limited edition items hold or gain value over time: 1. Rarity: Limited edition items are produced in limited quantities, which means there are only a certain number of these items available in the market. This rarity makes them more valuable as they are sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. 2. Exclusivity: Limited edition items are often marketed as exclusive products, giving the buyers a sense of prestige and uniqueness. This exclusivity factor can enhance their desirability and may result in a higher value in the future. 3. Collectability: Some limited edition items become more collectible over time. For example, limited edition books, coins, stamps, or artwork can accumulate more historical and cultural significance as time passes, thus increasing their value. 4. Quality: Limited edition items typically have a higher quality and craftsmanship compared to mass-produced items. This enhanced quality can enhance the long-term value of the product. 5. Demand: If the demand for an item increases over time, and if the supply of that item is limited, the value of the item can increase by the basic principles of supply and demand. However, it is important to note that not all limited edition items will necessarily increase in value or hold their value over time. Some factors, such as changes in consumer preferences, market conditions, or the condition of the item, can negatively affect the future value. Additionally, the value of limited edition items can be subjective and can depend on the specific interests and preferences of collectors or enthusiasts. In conclusion, although there may be exceptions and factors that could affect the future value of some limited edition items, we can generally say that \\"Usually, a limited edition of anything has some value later.\\" This claim is based on the rarity, exclusivity, collectability, quality, and demand associated with limited edition items."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given an original reference as well as a system generated reference.

Here is a news article: The four people that authorities thought were missing since a twin-engine aircraft crashed Thursday morning on top of a building at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport apparently are the same four who were confirmed dead earlier in the day, authorities said. The pilot, retired air traffic controller Mark Goldstein, was the only one on board the plane. ||||| The Beechcraft King Air B200 that crashed Thursday morning at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport was manufactured 15 years ago and had been reacquired by its manufacturer earlier this fall.      Federal Aviation Administration records show Beechraft Corp. at 10511 E. Central was the registered owner of the twin-engine turboprop airplane that received its airworthiness certificate on Dec. 18, 1999.      The airplane’s prior owner was Sheetz Inc., an Altoona, Pa.-based convenience store chain, said Sheetz spokeswoman Tarah Arnold. “We sold the plane on Sept. 25 … back to Beechcraft,” Arnold said.      An official from Textron Aviation, the owner of Beechcraft, said in an e-mail to The Eagle on Thursday that the company would not comment on any stories related to Thursday’s crash because it has been “invited” to participate in the National Transportation Safety Board investigation.      That investigation has just begun, and no conclusions about the cause of the deadly crash are expected for months. It typically takes more than a year for the NTSB to render a final report for an airplane crash, although it often releases preliminary data sooner.      Two aviation experts described the King Air line of airplanes as reliable.      “The 200 was the first King Air with a T-tail,” said David Bernstorf of BSC Consulting, who was an engineer at Beechcraft and its predecessor companies for 37 years. “When I came to work at Beech, that was the first project I was assigned to.”      Bernstorf said there have been a number of variations since the 200, the original certification of which was in December 1973. He said the B200 model, the type in Thursday’s crash, featured upgraded engines and an upgrade to its four-blade propellers.      “It’s a pretty rugged airplane, has good performance,” he said.      “It’s been around forever, and it’s a workhorse,” said John Eakin, owner of Texas-based Air Data Research. Eakin is a commercially licensed pilot and aircraft mechanic, and his company analyzes aircraft safety and crash information.      He also said the Pratt & Whitney turbine engines that power the King Air have the same characteristics as the airplane.      “It’s a good, solid engine that’s been around forever,” Eakin said.      He said the King Air traces its history back to the Beech Queen Air in the 1950s.      “Just offhand, I can’t think of any really spectacular problem that’s been found on them,” Eakin said.      “A lot of airplanes are known for problems. The King Air isn’t known for anything bad.”                   ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"An airplane called the Beechcraft King Air B200 crashed at an airport. This airplane is usually very strong and safe. Four people sadly died in the crash, and now special people called investigators are looking into what caused it.

Zaevion Dobson, who wore jersey number 24 on Fulton High School’s football team, was killed while shielding three girls from random gunfire the previous night. (ADAM LAU/NEWS SENTINEL)      By Kristi L. Nelson of the Knoxville News Sentinel      There's no memorial on the porch at 2704 Badgett Drive — nothing to suggest a 15-year-old boy died there Thursday night.      The yard is empty of crosses or flowers. In the street, neighbors in Lonsdale Homes public housing come and go from work or errands, grill food, play basketball in the street.      Knoxville police say Fulton High School sophomore Zaevion Dobson took a bullet there, shielding three teenage girls from a stranger's gunshots.      \\"He died laying on top of me,\\" one of the girls, Faith Gordon, said in a Twitter post. \\"That's my brother. Rest easy, Zae. I'll never forget you.\\"      Gordon said the shooting happened so quickly, the girls didn't realize Dobson had been shot until after it was over, when he didn't leave the porch to go inside. She didn't say who lived at the apartment, where no one answered the door Saturday.      Gordon and more than 100 other people attended a candlelight vigil in Dobson's memory Friday night at nearby Sam E. Hill Park, where the sign for the adjacent community center reads, \\"Remembering Zaevion Dobson, Falcon 24\\" — the jersey number he wore as a starting linebacker on Fulton's varsity football team this past season.      Police have called the shooting gang-related, but investigators don't believe Dobson was a target. Police have linked the gunshots that killed him to two other shootings that night: one about three hours earlier, when 46-year-old Lisa Perry was shot at a Dallas Street house, and one about four hours later, when Perry's son Brandon, 23, was shot as his car crashed into an apartment at the Green Hills complex near downtown. He died several hours later.      Police said Brandon Perry and Christopher Drone Bassett, 20, who was arrested Friday and charged with being a felon in possession of a gun and violating probation, drove to Lonsdale with another man and fired into the group of teens around 10:12 p.m. Neighbors said the teenagers were walking home after playing basketball at a local recreation center.      \\"Most children that age would have ran,\\" said Denitra Cash, who lives between Badgett Drive and the apartment of Dobson's mother, Zenobia Dobson. \\"He didn't. He saved lives.\\"      Cash said she grew up with Dobson's mother, well-known in the neighborhood and nicknamed \\"Tinkerbell.\\" Zenobia Dobson raised her three sons to be \\"the kind of boys who get up and go to church, get up and go to school, you don't have to pressure them to do the right thing,\\" Cash said.      Cash's 7-year-old son looked up to Dobson and his older brother, Zack, a junior defensive back/wide receiver on Fulton's football team who was featured on ESPN's \\"SportsCenter\\" this fall after catching a pass while doing a back flip in practice.      Thursday night's shooting \\"scares me to death,\\" Cash said.      Many neighbors around the Badgett Drive apartment are refugees fleeing violence in their home countries in Africa and the Middle East. Hearing gunshots \\"brings back trauma,\\" said one man, who asked not to be identified.      Some other neighbors questioned a connection to gang violence, which they said has been less prevalent over the past few years. Instead, they wondered whether it stemmed from jealousy of the brothers' sports talent.      But 61-year-old Terry McAfee, who said he's lived in Lonsdale Homes \\"all my life,\\" said gang violence in the complex hasn't really subsided: \\"It's just gone undercover.\\"      On Saturday, in a house full of family and friends offering support and prayers, Zenobia Dobson made plans for her son's funeral, set for the day after Christmas at 11 a.m. at Overcoming Believers Church on Harriet Tubman Street, to accommodate the expected crowd that her home church, Martin Chapel United Methodist, can't hold.      Dobson asked that those who attend the funeral wear maroon, one of Fulton's school colors.      Friends have set up an online GoFundMe account to cover funeral expenses. As of Saturday night, the effort had raised more than 27,000 toward its 30,000 goal. A GoFundMe effort to start a scholarship in Dobson's name had raised more than 1,000 toward its 10,000 goal.      Friends and strangers alike have hailed Dobson as a hero on social media, with hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons retweeting a picture of the teen in his Fulton football uniform.      Dobson's story gained airtime on CNN, ESPN and the three major TV networks; CBS Nightly News had a satellite truck set up on Fulton's football field Saturday afternoon, taping interviews with football coach Rob Black and others.      Andre Canty, president of 100 Black Men of Greater Knoxville, said members of the service organization began mentoring Dobson in elementary school, then watched him turn around and mentor younger boys himself in high school.      \\"He didn't wait until he was 18 or 19 years old\\" to give back, said Canty, who noted Dobson was involved with Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero's Save Our Sons Summit for young black men. \\"A lot of teenagers are not even thinking of someone else. He was a leader.\\"      Dobson also worked with younger boys at the Emerald Youth Foundation. The foundation's director, Steve Diggs, is the team's chaplain and led the team in prayer during a meeting Friday, said Ben Conaway, Fulton athletic trainer.      \\"We talk a lot about loving God and loving each other as brothers, as family, the importance of that,\\" Conaway said. \\"So that culture is active here already. Now is the time they can take that and really bond together, to grieve and support one another — especially Zack.\\"      Members of Fulton's basketball team wrote Dobson's jersey number on their shoes before Friday night's game, Conaway said. A widely shared tagline on social media urged people to \\"Remember his name.\\"      At Fulton, that's certain, Conaway said.      \\"He treated people really well and loved on his friends a lot and was a joy to be around,\\" Conaway said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short description of something that includes the main points and important details.

Please write a short summary for the following article: France’s Anthem, ‘La Marseillaise,’ to Unite Soccer Rivals Roy Hodgson, manager of the English national soccer team, said he hoped England's fans would join in singing the French national anthem, \\"La Marseillaise,\\" at the match between the two set for Tuesday. As Michael Cooper noted in The New York Times, the French national anthem, “La Marseillaise,” has emerged as a symbol of defiance and hope in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris last week. On Tuesday, France will play its first major sporting event since the attacks, a friendly soccer game against England at Wembley in London. In soccer, national anthems at sporting events are not always respected by opposing fans. But for this game, English supporters will be encouraged to sing along in solidarity, and the words will be displayed on the big screens to help them. It may be a stirring moment of peaceful unity between two nations with a rivalry dating to Agincourt. But a close look at the song’s lyrics, written at the height of the bloody French Revolution, adds a note of incongruity. “Allons enfants de la Patrie, le jour de gloire est arrivé,” the anthem begins, stirringly. “Arise, children of the fatherland. The day of glory has arrived.” The song then veers quickly into more bellicose language, going on about “L’étendard sanglant” (the bloodstained banner), “féroces soldats” (ferocious soldiers) and, disconcertingly, warning of enemies, “Égorger vos fils, vos compagnes!” (cutting the throats of children and consorts). The conclusion urges citizens, “Qu’un sang impur, abreuve nos sillons!” (“Let impure blood water our furrows.”) Subsequent verses continue the violent imagery, raising the disturbing specters of bloodthirsty tyrants, angry tigers and children sharing their forebears’ coffins. Of course, bombs are “bursting in air” in other national anthems, too. Perhaps when Englishmen and Frenchmen get together to sing off-key on Tuesday, it will be better not to listen too closely.","output":"A soccer game between France and England is happening on Tuesday.

Jane is blamed for the ensuing fight, and Mrs. Reed has two of the servants drag her off and lock her up in the red-room, the unused chamber where Mr. Reed had died. Still locked in that night, Jane sees a light and panics, thinking that her uncle's ghost has come. Her scream rouses the house, but Mrs. Reed just locks up Jane for longer. Then Jane has a fit and passes out. A doctor, Mr. Lloyd, comes to Gateshead Hall and suggests that Jane go to school.Mr. Brocklehurst is a cold, cruel, self-righteous, and highly hypocritical clergyman who runs a charity school called Lowood. He accepts Jane as a pupil in his school. Jane is infuriated, however, when Mrs. Reed tells him, falsely, that Jane is a liar. After Brocklehurst departs, Jane bluntly tells Mrs. Reed how she hates the Reed family. Mrs. Reed, so shocked that she is scarcely capable of responding, leaves the drawing room in haste.Jane finds life at Lowood to be grim. Miss Maria Temple, the youthful superintendent, is just and kind, but another teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is sour and abusive. Mr. Brocklehurst, visiting the school for an inspection, has Jane placed on a tall stool before the entire assemblage. He then tells them that \\"...this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernautthis girl isa liar!\\"Later that day, Miss Temple allows Jane to speak in her own defence. After Jane does so, Miss Temple writes to Mr. Lloyd.... Answer:","output":"In the movie adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's novel \\"Jane Eyre,\\" the character who is riding the horse is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He is the brooding, enigmatic master of Thornfield Hall, where Jane works as a governess for Rochester's ward, Adele Varens. It's important to note that the plot summary you provided does not mention the specific scene where Rochester is riding the horse. In the novel, Jane encounters Rochester for the first time while he is riding his horse, which gets spooked and causes Rochester to fall. This initial encounter sets the stage for the complex relationship between Jane and Rochester, which forms the emotional core of the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ma's naked body was discovered in the water near the San Francisco Bay Trail in Sunnyvale, California, last week. She was a resident of nearby Mountain View and had joined Google early in the previous year. The uncertainty surrounding the circumstances of Ma's death has left authorities puzzled. Captain Shawn Ahearn of the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety shared that they are unsure whether anyone witnessed her death or what led to it. Therefore, during the investigation, they are considering all possibilities. It is still unclear how Ma's body ended up in the water near the popular jogging and cycling trail, which attracts many users daily. Toxicology tests have been conducted to aid the investigation, but the results are expected to take some weeks. As of now, the police are uncertain whether Ma's body drifted to the location from elsewhere in the San Francisco Bay, which would mean the actual incident might have taken place at a different location. This adds to the challenges faced by law enforcement as they continue to piece together clues and gather information. Ma's boyfriend filed a missing persons report with the police in Mountain View on the same day her body was found. The tragic and unexpected passing of an exceptional young engineer shocked her colleagues at Google, where she had been highly esteemed. Her talents and contributions to the company were acknowledged and praised. A Google spokesperson expressed their devastation upon learning about Ma's death and extended their deepest condolences to her family and friends. As the investigation into Chuchu Ma's mysterious death continues, the community, her family, and her friends all await answers and hope for justice.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What did Hans Müller think would prevent tragedy befalling he and his family?, using the article: After World War II, a German named Hans Müller is one of a shipload of Jewish refugees who disembark at Haifa in 1949. Like many other concentration camp survivors, Hans has psychological problems, including survivor guilt. At one point, he mistakes a woman and some children for his murdered family. At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street. Hans flees and ends up sleeping in the countryside, where he is found by a teenage orphan Sabra, Yehoshua \\"Josh\\" Bresler. Hans pretends to be an eccentric American, out to see Israel firsthand. Josh offers to be his guide. During their journey, Hans reveals that he was a professional juggler; Josh persuades him to pass on his knowledge. Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale). They are attracted to each other, but he at first strongly resists her attempt to persuade him to remain at the kibbutz. He reveals to her that he had ignored warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany before it was too late, making the fatal mistake of counting on his fame and popularity to protect his family. Gradually, however, he begins to settle in. Karni finally tracks Hans down and tries to take him into custody. Hans panics again and barricades himself in Ya'el's room with her rifle, but Ya'el and Karni get him to admit he needs help and to give himself up., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"In the article, Hans Müller believed that his fame and popularity would prevent tragedy from befalling him and his family. As a professional juggler, he thought his reputation and the admiration from the public would offer a sense of safety and security, allowing them to ignore the early warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany. Unfortunately, this proved to be a fatal mistake. Hans underestimated the extent of the danger posed by the Nazi regime and ultimately could not protect his family from the tragic consequences. It is clear that Hans grapples with survivor guilt and psychological issues after his experiences in the concentration camp. Throughout his journey in Haifa, Hans repeatedly acts out in fear and panic, demonstrating his inability to process his traumatic past. It is only when he allows himself to connect with others, such as the kibbutz resident Ya'el and the teenage orphan, Josh, that he starts to gain a new perspective on life and find the hope, strength, and support that he needs. In conclusion, Hans Müller initially believed that his fame as a professional juggler would protect him and his family from the impending tragedy during the Nazi regime. However, this proved to be a misguided belief and a grave error in judgment. As Hans embarks on a journey towards healing and acceptance, he learns the importance of connecting with others and facing his past with the support of those who genuinely care for him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a young teenager at the time, Airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" to have amazing gadgets and whizz-bang explosions. In many ways, the show was essentially Knight Rider in the skies: similar comic-book technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of one man making a difference. But in other, important ways, it was thematically very different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of the time. For one thing, the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need, but by Stringfellow Hawke's possession of Airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his MIA brother, St John). And then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an 80s Cold War context, complete with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the enemy within. Sure, The A-Team constantly referred back to Vietnam and the team's status as fugitives, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself. With Airwolf, the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show - although this was (ill-advisedly) diluted as the series went on. With hindsight, the Cold War setting clearly dates the series, many of the stories are creaky and contrived, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. But that's really not the point. Airwolf was rip-roaring fun, it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences, and it didn't sugar-coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died. Sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded admirably - and on a TV budget to boot. For UK readers, DMAX (Sky channel 155) have just started (Jan 2008) daily re-runs of Airwolf. Set your Sky+ box for this blast from the past - we may even get the re-tooled, re-cast (and sadly vastly inferior) fourth season, which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the UK.

Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions.  Paragraph: Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country will be less misshapen on the map?","output":"Based on the paragraph provided and the background information on the Mercator projection, the country that will appear less misshapen on the map is Mexico. This is because Mexico is located closer to the equator in comparison to Norway, which is closer to the North Pole. The Mercator projection becomes more accurate within 15 degrees north or south of the equator, so any landmasses or countries within this zone will be less stretched and distorted in shape. Since Mexico falls within this zone, its representation on the map will be closer to its true dimensions, making it less misshapen compared to Norway, which will likely appear distorted due to its position near the North Pole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The question is asking about the issues or problems encountered with the mechanics of playback and recording, meaning the tangible, physical aspects involved in the procedure of recording and playing back sound. 2. The answer provided details about \\"acoustic limitations\\" which arise from \\"mechanical resonances\\". Acoustic refers to the properties or characteristics of sound. A mechanical resonance, in this context, refers when a system's natural frequency matches the frequency of some external force, potentially leading to damaging oscillations. This implies a tangible (mechanical) problem in creating or retrieving the recorded sound, which fits the requirement of the original question. 3. Moreover, the sentence specifies these issues apply to \\"both the recording and playback system\\". That fulfils the question’s requirement to address problems in both playback and recording mechanics. So, the answer provided does present a valid explanation to the issues related to playback and recording mechanics by elaborating on the impact of mechanical resonances on sound quality during the recording and playback process."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am...

Options: - race track - bed - ground - street - subway  The answer is \\"street\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"street\\" because streets are the most common places where you would find gutters and rubber hitting it regularly. Let's examine each option in detail to understand why the street is the correct answer. 1. Race Track: While it's true that race tracks involve rubber from tires hitting the surface frequently, gutters are not a common feature found on race tracks. Race tracks have specific drainage systems to keep the track dry, and they focus more on efficient water management than traditional gutters. Furthermore, race tracks are more likely to be kept clean from dirt as it can interfere with traction and performance. 2. Bed: Beds would not have gutters or rubber hitting it regularly. A bed is meant for sleeping, and it generally remains indoors, away from gutters and rubber. Therefore, it can be ruled out as an option for this question. 3. Ground: The ground is a broad term and could refer to any surface of the Earth. While gutters and rubber might exist on specific types of ground, such as a street, it's not specific enough to accurately answer this question. 4. Street: A street is a paved public thoroughfare typically found in urban areas. Streets are engineered with drainage systems that include gutters to manage rainwater and prevent flooding. Additionally, streets are designed for wheeled vehicles, including cars and bicycles, with rubber tires that make contact with the street surface regularly. Dirt can accumulate on streets and in gutters from a variety of sources, such as wind, erosion, and regular traffic. Therefore, \\"street\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question as it satisfies both conditions: having gutters and rubber hitting it regularly. 5. Subway: Subways refer to an underground railway system found in various large cities. While subways might have drainage systems in place, the term \\"gutter\\" is not typically associated with subways. Additionally, the rubber from tires is not applicable to subway trains as they operate on steel rails. Dirt might be found inside subway stations, but the probability of finding a gutter and encountering rubber is low. In conclusion, out of the given options, \\"street\\" is the most suitable answer to the question of where one might find dirt in a place with a gutter and rubber hitting it regularly. Streets are designed to manage rainwater through gutters and accommodate vehicles with rubber tires, making it a prime location for dirt to accumulate."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],q={key:0},D={key:1};function R(a,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",Y,[(n(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(n(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
