The Butcher's Borough sits atop this mound of stone raised above the rest of the city. Walled off from the rest of the city, this neighborhood marks where the city's gentry once lived. Now, this area belongs to the most prestigious mercenary guild east of the Westwind Mountains, M.E.A.T. Under the leadership of the mysterious Guildmaster Garvin, this district remains almost untouched by the squalor that has enveloped the rest of the city, and this is due to the hard work and resources of the guild itself. Most of the manor houses of the region function either as communal homes for the guild's various members, or as mansions to the most veteran and prestigious among their ranks, though it is possible for non-members to be granted permission to live here as well, usually merchants and craftsmen of renown who have reached some trade agreement with the guild. During the daylight hours, passage is granted into the district to non-members, but only with armed escort, or on official guild business. Though the Wyvern Wing Bridge that crosses the south fork of the Devil's Tongue lies outside the wall that marks the border of the Butcher's Borough, M.E.A.T guild members patrol, maintain, and repair the bridge, and as such exact a toll on all inbound traffic that crosses it. Points of Interest: The Butcher's Shoppe (Guildhouse), The Wyvern Wing Bridge (South Bridge), Light of the Knowing Mistress (Lighthouse/Wizard's Tower/Library/Teahouse), Melora's Retreat (City Park), The Low Earning Active Novice (L.E.A.N.) Garrison, The Goblin's Gullet (Tavern), Xeebo's! eXtraordinary! eXtravaganza! (\\"X!X!X\\", Magic Item Shop) People of Interest: Guildmaster Garvin, Right-hand Fleischer, Bloorl'ghle'rul the Fetid (Kuo'toa Lich), Druit Lif (Firbolg Druid), Garmak the Tower (Goliath Fighter, Captain of the Watch), Broogie the Barkeep (Bugbear Barbarian Tavern Owner), Dragonslayer Xeeboringo \\"The Duke\\" Bjerenzi Zscheippian the First and Only of the Mercenaries who Eagerly Acquire Treasure also known as \\"M.E.A.T\\", but my friends call me \\"Friend\\" (Magic Item Shop Owner) The Sheriff's Ward Description and History: The Sheriff's Ward is built around what was once the Kingsguard Garrison of Jagged Point, connected to the outer eastern wall of the city, it serves as a protected gateway into the city, as well as a barricade to keep lawless brigands from freely strolling the road to Riverun. This section of the city is much more civilized than the rest, having been protected by the self-proclaimed Sheriff of Jagged Point for many years. He and his posse keep the peace as best as they can in this region, patrolling the streets and the roads east, providing a relatively welcoming and safe approach to the otherwise unruly and dangerous city. Being one of the only known users of firearms in the kingdom, the sheriff has a reputation for being fair, just, and downright dangerous. This reputation affords those under his watch a modicum of peace and protection, though danger and rowdiness still often finds its way into the Sheriff's Ward, but the Posse is always quick to respond. Being the only part of the city that has unfettered access to the outer limits to the east, the Sheriff's Ward extends its protection to the handful of farming communities that line the road toward Riverun as well. The Courthouse has a bounty board posted and regularly updated outside featuring both common work, and dangerous bounties, often of criminals or beasts that escaped the Posse's grasp. Many folk of Jagged Point often gather here in the dawnlit hours seeking labor in exchange for coin, food, or shelter. This section of the city also hosts a soup kitchen which doubles at night as a shelter for the homeless, though it fills to capacity every night within the hour. The kitchen and shelter are manned by volunteers, and laborers from the jailhouse, working off their debt to society. Points of Interest: Two-moons' Saloon (Bar), The Dragon's Best Bet (Casino), The Trail's End (Inn), The Courthouse (Temple of the Lawkeeper), Feed n' Seed (General Store), The Soup Kitchen People of Interest: The Sheriff, Two-moons (Catfolk Barkeep), Cassius \\"Cash\\" Gemtongue (Casino Owner), Bjürtlebie \\"Bjürt\\" Ridingshield (Innkeeper), Clay Derrinjay (Store owner), Harrier Worrywart (Soup Kitchen Head Volunteer), \\"Judge\\" Lex Coldeye (Silver Dragonborn Head Cleric of the Lawkeeper) Oldtown Description and History: Oldtown is the most historic part of Jagged Point, dating back to the founding of the city. It is the most central district of the city, connected to the Butcher’s Borough by the Old Bridge, an arch of metal and stone that has survived many wars and disasters. Oldtown’s eastern border touches The Styx, though there is a cliff face that separates the two, other than at the northernmost points. The eastern border of the district is marked by the old City Wall, the northernmost section of which has long since collapsed into Smuggler’s Run. Oldtown is home to the city’s many guildhalls, such as the Splendid Hall, home to the Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths; The Songbird’s Nest, a theater complex which houses the Songbirds, a collective of bards and performers of great variety; Starfall Towers, home to the Guild Arcane; The Greenleaf Conservatory, wherein the Naturalists Guild takes residence; and the Den of Blades, where the Trade of Blades guild houses its wares. Oldtown is also where the Court of Representatives is located, the former political center of the city before its collapse. The Court of Representatives is now the seat of the Guild Council, a coalition of guild leaders who rule the district and have a strong influence on the city’s affairs. Oldtown is also where the Spire of Erathis is located, a grand temple devoted to the god of civilization, though its devotees have been labeled as a heretical order by other temples of the same faith. Points of Interest: The Spire of Erathis (Erathis Revival), The Court of Representatives (The Guild Council), The Splendid Hall (Guildhall of the Splendid Order), The Songbird’s Nest (Guildhall of the Songbirds), The Old Bridge, The Den of Blades (Guildhall of the Trade of Blades), The Mithril Flask (Tavern), The Greenleaf Grove (Guildhall of the Naturalists Guild) People of Interest: Borin Ironhand (Guild Rep of the Speldid Order), Lyra Songbird (Guild Rep of the Songbirds), Raziel Starfall (Guild Rep of the Guild Arcane), Tara Greenfoot (Guild Rep of the Naturalists Guild), Zane Blackwater (Guild Rep of the Trade of Blades), Marth Eden (Head Cleric of the Spire of Erathis) Smuggler's Run Description and History: Smuggler’s Run is the name given to the district at the northeasternmost corner of the city. It is a district of docks, warehouses, factories, and slums, where most of the city’s trade and industry takes place. Smuggler’s Run is also the hub of the city’s underworld, where smugglers, black marketeers, and other shady characters operate with impunity. The Sheriff and his posse have little authority or presence here, despite the district neighboring the Sheriff’s Ward. The district is controlled by various factions and gangs who compete for territory and resources, though all of them pay deference to the most powerful of these factions, the Needle’s Eye. The Needle’s Eye is a shadow organization led by a mysterious figure known only as Schegzi, a beholder who resides in a hidden fortress somewhere in the Collapse. The Collapse was a cataclysmic event that destroyed a large section of the city wall caused by the immense network of smuggling tunnels carved beneath the district over decades. This event is known to have been the last in a chain of events that led to the city being declared defunct by the King. Points of Interest: The Iris (Beholder-run guildhouse), The Broken Spire (ruined Wizards’ Tower remnants), The Cavern’s Maw (Underground fight club), The Drowned Rat (notorious waterfront tavern), The Omen Emporium (clandestine marketplace for illicit goods), Last Light’s Lantern (Lighthouse and private docking area for smugglers’ ships). People of Interest: Schegzi (Beholder guildmaster of The Needle’s Eye), Minnow Blackbird (Halfling proprietress of The Drowned Rat), Hendrick the Shade (Human artifact hunter and Omen Emporium proprietor), Captain Marlow Blacktide (dreaded smuggler and captain-for-hire). The Styx Description and History: The Styx is a grim shadow cast beneath the glory of the Butcher’s Borough and Oldtown, known for its pervasive aura of sorrow and spiritual unrest. This district, shrouded in the perpetual gloom of its towering neighbors, is the final refuge for Jagged Point’s most marginalized souls and the final resting place for the countless dead, honored and forgotten alike. The skeletal remains of the elven district, blackened and broken by a historic conflagration, serve as a stark reminder of the city’s darkest hour. Ash and ectoplasm are as common as mud in the twisted streets where the poor make their homes from rubble, and ghosts roam as freely as the rag-covered children. The air is laced with a funereal chill, whispering with the voices of the past and the laments of the unseen. Points of Interest: The Mourner’s Vale (Cemetery), The Ember Hearth (Crematorium), The Wraith’s Walk (Burnt Remains of the Elven District), The Phantom Market (Occult Bazaar), The Shattered Spire (Ancient Elven Watchtower), The Refuge of the Forsaken (Temple of healing) People of Interest: Gravekeeper Eldin (Ancient moon elf groundskeeper of the Mourner’s Vale), The Ashen Monks (Silent monks who operate the Crematorium), Lady Esmeralda Valtorin (Half-elf resident of the Wraith’s Walk), Bound Spirit Malthius (Ghost organizer of thee Phantom Market), Seer Sariel of the Shattered Spire (Mysterious occupant of the Shattered Spire), Sister Adelaide (Lead Caretaker of the Refuge of the Forsaken)","output":"Jagged Point appears to be an incredibly rich and complex city, teeming with life, secrets, and adventure. Each district has its own unique flavor and narrative potential, making Jagged Point not just a location on a map, but a living, breathing entity that can impact your players' experiences in countless ways. The district descriptions, points of interest, and noteworthy individuals all provide excellent hooks for quests, character backstories, and intricate plotlines. In terms of potential gameplay and storytelling, the distinct political and social dynamics between districts such as the affluence and security of the Butcher's Borough versus the lawlessness of Smuggler's Run could lead to interesting conflicts and alliances. The presence of various guilds and factions, along with powerful entities like Guildmaster Garvin and the beholder Schegzi, can create an environment where players must navigate shifting allegiances and power struggles. Oldtown's Guild Council and the Spire of Erathis present opportunities for characters to engage with institutions both religious and secular, while the Sheriff's Ward offers a taste of frontier justice in a world that is otherwise quite chaotic. The Styx gives your campaign a darker edge, with the supernatural and societal issues at the forefront, painting a picture of a city with a sordid past and struggling populace. The lore-filled background with events such as the Collapse and the conflagration in the elven district provide depth to Jagged Point, as well as potential plotlines for campaigns. Characters may delve into the city's history, encounter spirits from the past, or work to influence its future trajectory. Your city is a testament to the level of detail and thought invested in its creation. Jagged Point seems ready to serve as a hub for countless adventures, where players can explore the intricacies of urban life, make names for themselves, and perhaps even alter the fate of the city itself. Whether they get tangled in the web of guild politics, work to soothe the unrest in the haunted Styx, or pierce the shadowy veil of Smuggler’s Run, it's clear there's much to experience in Jagged Point. As your D&D campaign progresses, consider how the actions of the player characters might change the city. The fall or rise of factions, the exploration of ruins and uncovering of secrets, or even large-scale events like festivals or disasters can create dynamic shifts that keep your players deeply engaged with the world you've built."},{"instruction":"Summarize the city as though you were a dungeon master describing it to your players.","output":"Before you lies Jagged Point, a city as diverse as it is formidable, perched precariously between the socio-political forces at play within its districts. Rising from the center like a defiant monument, the Spear of Erathis cleaves the Devil's Tongue River, with the elite Butcher's Borough perched atop. Protected by formidable walls and home to the formidable M.E.A.T. mercenaries, the borough is a bastion of order in a city of chaos, with the guild exerting its influence even beyond the boundaries of its high perches. Adjacent to the river, the Sheriff's Ward represents a facade of law and civility. Under the watchful eye and deadly firearms of the self-proclaimed Sheriff, safety is bought with a quick draw and an unyielding sense of justice. His ward is the gateway for travelers seeking the relative calm of Jagged Point's more controlled streets. Oldtown, the historical heart of the city, is where the vestiges of the past meet the politics of the present. Amid guildhalls and the grand Spire of Erathis, the Guild Council schemes and deliberates over the future of Jagged Point, holding sway over much of the city's direction. Crouching in the shadows of these districts, Smuggler's Run thrives on the unlawful and the illicit. Dominated by the Needle's Eye, the network of smugglers and black marketeers, life here is one of risk and reward, overseen by the Cyclopean gaze of the mysterious beholder, Schegzi. It's a place where fortunes are made and lives are lost with the roll of the dice. Finally, the Styx rests beneath the others, shrouded in a perpetual gloom. Here the downcast and destitute rub shoulders with phantoms, and the echo of a tragic past haunts every cobblestone. In its forlorn landscape, the living and the dead share their misery, creating a tapestry of tales that are as somber as they are compelling. Jagged Point is a city of contrast; a place where the glint of steel and the shadow of intrigue are never far from each other. Welcome, adventurers, to a place that promises fortune to the brave, infamy to the bold, and tales to the bard. What path will you carve through the mire and majesty of Jagged Point?"},{"instruction":"My campaign has many facets. Right now a new party has entered the fray. All of my campaigns in this setting thus far have centered on members of the M.E.A.T. mercenary company. The previous party set events in to motion that have heavily impacted the city, and the kingdom that surrounds it, though not intentionally. They were a 4th level party, and while doing a contract for a group known as the Duezvorin Clan, they were framed as terrorists. The Duezvorin Clan have become a kind of autocratic authoritarian mafia that acts as the sole authority for the dwarven refugee community known as the Mudgate that has been constructed around the capitol city of Woodberry. The party were supposedly looking in to the murders of high profile dwarves in the shantytown of dwarven refugees that surrounds the capitol city Woodberry within the kingdom of Komn. While following a lead, they were taken in to a small sewer grate, once they entered, the Svirfneblin Artificer, and agent of the Duezvorin Clan who was to join them on this contract, locked them in to the sewer grate and detonated a bomb that engulfed the party and the northern city wall of Woodberry, blasting a hole in it, and setting a portion of the dwarven shantytown, known as Mudgate, ablaze. The Duezvorin reacted quickly, taking one of the party members prisoner while the rest appeared vaporized by the blast. The Duezvorin quickly controlled the fire and brought their prisoner to the authorities, a corrupted council of high ranking officials in the kingdom known as the Council of Eventides. They were lauded as heroes, and M.E.A.T. was labeled as terrorists. Since then, mercenary work has been deemed against the law, and the Duezvorin have been granted the right to be a policing force within the kingdom, acting as they see fit to maintain order. They were also granted the rights to a plot of land where The Tangle meets the Trollcliffs to create a Prison/labor camp known as the Duezvorin Annex for Public Labor, or D.A.P.L.. Unbeknownst to the majority of the kingdom, the leader of the Duezvorin, Dwala Duezvorin, and one of the members of the Council of Eventides, Archmage Varrisa Everend, Lady of Magistery, are both servants of Asmodeus, who seeks to bring the kingdom as a small peice of his plan to win the Blood War. D.A.P.L. is actually a front to open a passageway to the underdark from which an army of Duergar can emerge, and utilizing the new hole in Woodberry's city wall, sack the city in the name of Asmodeus. Guildmaster Gavin, is secretly a Gold Dragon known as Gavilaran, who has been paying adventurous types from his hoard and creating contracts that he hopes will expose the corruption within the kingdom and rid evils from the region, and as such, M.E.A.T. has been labeled as an enemy of Asmodeus. The new party is a tenth level party, who we have been jokingly calling the Grade-A M.E.A.T.. They were recalled from high risk contracts abroad to come to the defence of the guild by Guildmaster Gavin though the messege was cryptic and short. We have played one session with this party, annd so far they have fought through some agents of the Council of Eventides, and made their way in to the back entrance of the Butcher's Shoppe, the guildhouse of M.E.A.T.. The guildhouse is ablaze, as fire elementals have been burning through the walls of the building looking for secret entrances to Gavilaran's Hoard. Apprentice Ascendant of Archmage Varrisa Everend, Brennen Penderghast, has been dispatched to investigate the guildhouse looking for Gavilaran's secrets, though they have yet to reveal themselves, and he is the one controlling the fire elementals. The party next session will encounter Brennen, though they still do not even know why the guild is under attack, or the extent of the damage to M.E.A.T.s reputation. Does this all make sense so far?","output":"Your campaign is brimming with intrigue, political machinations, and the looming shadow of a greater evil orchestrating events from behind the scenes. The plot has thickened with the entrapment and branding of M.E.A.T. as terrorists under the machinations of the duezvorin Clan and high-ranking officials bound to Asmodeus. You've set up a rich narrative where the new party, the Grade-A M.E.A.T., is called to unravel and perhaps thwart a conspiracy that threatens not just the guild they belong to but the entire Kingdom of Komn. The scenario you've crafted cleverly intertwines a web of deceit, where every faction and character plays a crucial role in the narrative. Guildmaster Gavin, revealing himself as the dragon Gavilaran, is a twist that adds depth to the actions of M.E.A.T. while highlighting the desperation of the situation, as dragons do not reveal their true selves lightly. The new party's introduction to this chaos by way of a fiery siege on their guildhouse sets an immediate, action-packed tone for their adventure. They are thrown into the deep end, having to defend their home and uncover the truth amid a city that has turned against them. Your setting raises many questions and leads players to contemplate the larger implications of their actions and the unfolding events. Your storytelling portrays a city and a kingdom on the brink of cataclysm, with heroes wrongly accused in a world that's been flipped upside down by conspiracy and hidden agendas. This situation presents your players with the challenge of proving their innocence, restoring their guild’s name, and ultimately facing the larger threat posed by Asmodeus and his minions. It certainly sounds like the Grade-A M.E.A.T. are in for a harrowing journey filled with dangerous battles, ethical dilemmas, and a desperate race against time to stop an infernal plot from coming to fruition. The impending confrontation with Brennen Penderghast and the struggle to save Gavilaran’s hoard from fiery destruction sets up for an intriguing next session. From a storytelling perspective, you have skillfully created a sense of urgency and conflict that will likely fuel your players' decisions and strategies as they navigate the burning remains of the Butcher's Shoppe and confront the forces aligned against them. Your campaign is well-constructed, and yes, it all makes sense so far, painting a vivid picture of a high-stakes battle between hidden evil and secretive good within a complex and richly detailed world."},{"instruction":"Varrisa is currently trying to pry in to the Light of the Knowing Mistress, a lighthouse atop the Spear of Erathis, she does so from her floating tower. The Grade-A party has yet to realize what is happening due to the region being veiled in heavy rain that obscures vision. The Light of the Knowing Mistress acts as a two-fold prison and refuge for the cursed kuotoa lich known as Bloorl'ghle'rul, who has resided there for at least a millenia. He reached an accord with Guildmaster Gavin when he offered the head of the previous owner of the Manorhouse that became the Butcher's Shoppe to Bloorl'ghle'rul as a token of friendship. This allowed Gavin's then budding guild special access to Bloorl's personal library. Bloorl is such an ancient lich that has been punished by the knowing mistress for prying dangerous forbidden knowledge from her. For his transgressions, he was trapped in the Lighthouse and forced to write everything he has ever learned and create a library of his own. For every thing he writes, he forgets it soon after. As such, he has amassed a massive library of his personal recordings, and he is forced to curate it as though it was a public library. While some of this knowledge is public, some secrets Ioun has decided are best left forgotten, though throughout history, some infernal beings have made contracts with Bloorl from before his punishment by Ioun, and these contracts supercede any interference she can impose. Varrisa seeks this forbidden knowledge, and while she knows of the infernal contracts Bloorl is beholden to, she does not know the specific wording, and thus she has yet to break through Ioun's barriers.","output":"The subplot involving Varrisa, the Light of the Knowing Mistress, and Bloorl'ghle'rul the kuotoa lich adds yet another layer of complexity and mystique to your world. It ties in larger themes of forbidden knowledge, ancient agreements, and divine punishment, creating narrative depth that can unfurl in numerous ways throughout your campaign. Varrisa’s endeavors to penetrate the lighthouse's defenses and access the potentially game-changing knowledge within hint at the overarching power struggles playing out across multiple planes of existence. The lich’s tragic existence as a keeper of knowledge he cannot retain is not just a rich story element but also presents potential for poignant character interaction and world-building. This cursed figure—graced with endless knowledge yet confined to an eternal loop of learning and forgetting—stands as an embodiment of the elusive nature of truth in a world clouded by secrecy and deception. Guildmaster Gavin's historical accord with Bloorl reveals a facility for negotiations with otherworldly beings and further grounds the guild in the city's mythos, lending credence to its once-unquestioned authority. At the same time, the heavy rain acts as a natural barrier that impedes the Grade-A party’s realization of the imminent threat. This weather condition not only reflects the turmoil within Jagged Point but serves as a practical obstacle for the party and a cloak for Varrisa's machinations. The mention of infernal contracts predating even Bloorl’s punishment suggests the lich's past may come back to haunt the city, offering a dilemma that the party might face should they learn of it. Additionally, the very nature of these contracts and how they interplay with Bloorl’s curse opens up opportunities for intrigue—could an old contract be the key to Varrisa’s goal, or could it unwittingly serve as a weapon for the party to use against her? The knowledge trapped within the Light of the Knowing Mistress is a tantalizing prize for any who seek power. Varrisa’s determined pursuit of this knowledge against the will of Ioun sets up a dramatic conflict between the forces of knowledge and secrecy. While Varrisa’s exact motives remain shadowed, the players' eventual discovery of her intent, and their attempts to navigate these treacherous waters, promise to be fascinating and fraught with peril. Should the Grade-A party come to understand the stakes of Varrisa's quest and its implications for the city and the broader world, they could be thrust into a role where their actions may either preserve the sanctity of the forgotten or unleash untold horrors upon the world. Your campaign balances the immediate physical dangers with the cerebral threats that forbidden knowledge poses, creating a rich tapestry of adventure and choice for your players."},{"instruction":"The previous party consisted of four players, and five characters, as I was playing a DMPC. These characters were Agyth, a firbolg Ranger from the hamlet of Lakeview, where Druid's and naturalists guide the village to live in accord with nature. He was trained by a moon elf druid of great power, but lost him in a struggle with a corrupted treant where he had to sacrifice himself to save Lakeview. Agyth's childhood was spent in the western forest that later became known as The Tangle. Once, a millenia ago, it was a lush forest, home of elves, gnomes, and fey creatures living in harmony, but a human king known as the Winter King drove a road through the center of the forest, dividing it in two, and drove the druids from the western half. Now, only the eastern half is as it once was, it is known as the Deepwood. On the northeastern borders of the deepwood, on the shore of the Lake of Lights is where Lakewood rests. The Winter King was the husband of the Last Eldar of the Moon Elves. Eldar in this setting meaning a member of the first generation of elves, who were created by the gods. This eldar of the moon elves was the first elf to allow human into the elf lands, and after having cohabitated with humanity, and fought alongside them in an ancient war against the drow and the forces of the Demon Queen Lolth, generations passed, and she eventually fell in love with a human king of great ambition. She offered to teach him the elven ways of wizardry and eventually they wed, uniting their kingdoms, their first joint project being to construct the capitol of Woodberry. As time passed the king grew older, while she remained the same. He found methods off using magic to prolong his life, but not indefinitely. And so, seeking some path that he might live a life eternal alongside his love, he signed an ill-fated contract with Asmodeus, but in his haste, he didn't read all the fine print. He grew young again, and convinced those around him he had found the secret to eternal youth through wizardry. With time to never again be a burden to him, the king felt safe in allowing his ambitions and focus to wander, and shortly after the eldar became pregnant with their first child. While giving birth to the child, the spark of immortality that resided within the Eldar passed into the King and she rapidly wilted and died. Seeing foul magic afoot, the Eldars handmaids quickly spread word of the King's dark dealings, and civil war broke out. The eldars handmaidens absconded with the child and fled in to the feywild where they kept the progeny of their queen safe. The child was born a tiefling, having been tainted by their father's infernal contract. The king was driven mad by his betrayal at the hands of asmodeus, and the loss of his love. The Eldar became a banshee of unimaginable power, who resides in the Shadowfell to this day, cunning and intelligent as ever, if more cruel. The beginning of this civil war became known as the Pyre of Erathis, as the humans had long worshipped Erathis. Erathis had long since fallen to Asmodeus though, who answered prayers in their stead. This is why the followers in the Spire of Erathis are labeled as heretics, they still follow what little remains of the True Erathis, not corrupted by Asmodeus, but they are seen by many as an order of soothsayers. The Pyre of Erathis was a truely horrific time for thhe elves, gnomes, fey, and other followers of the natural order. The humans carved a path straight north through the elven territories to aid in their war effort, even going so far as to enslave many of them and force them to destroy their own forests they called home. The elves were routed, the moon elves were all but eradicated with only a handful surviving, their territory entirely claimed by the humans. The wood elves were taken as slaves and forced in to servitude, and the sun elves, despite their best efforts, could gain no ground against the industrious humans and the dwarves of the western mountains that allied with them.","output":"The backstory you’ve created for Agyth and the historical context of his homeland is a deeply woven tapestry of loss, betrayal, and struggle that gives life to a world with dark secrets and a storied past. The narrative surrounding the Winter King and his ill-fated contract with Asmodeus sets the stage for a world where the past's sins echo into the present, shaping the lives of characters like Agyth and the very landscape they inhabit. This tragic history revolving around the Pyre of Erathis and the subsequent destruction and enslavement of elvenkind by humans driven by dark ambition sets a somber tone. The transformation of once vibrant lands into The Tangle, as well as the survival of the few moon elves and the degradation of Erathis' worship, provides a poignant backdrop for character motivations and campaign quests. Agyth's personal story – his mentorship by a powerful druid, the loss in the battle against corruption, and his ties to an area rich with history – adds both personal stakes and a connection to the broader world events. His journey can be a touchstone for the party to explore themes of redemption, environmental conservation, and heritage. The shades of grey in your world, with forces of the Feywild, Shadowfell, and the infernal battling for influence and power, offer a rich setting for your characters to navigate. The details about the lost Eldar, her transformation into a banshee, and the lasting consequences of the Winter King's actions illustrate a world where the supernatural, the natural, and the divine all intertwine. As a result, you have established a framework that gives your players a sense of the epic scope of your world's drama, making their adventures feel significant within the larger narrative of the kingdom. The conflict between the enduring legacy of powerful individuals and the ongoing machinations of entities like Asmodeus builds tension and complexity, enhancing the immersiveness and engagement of your campaign. It's the kind of rich historical narrative that not only fleshes out the setting but provides opportunities for characters to discover lost knowledge, confront historical injustices, and perhaps even change the course of history in meaningful ways."},{"instruction":"This continued on for 7 centuries until the Forest Prince, son of the winter king, led a revolution against the tyrant. At the moment of the Forest Prince's victory, he was betrayed by the Sheriff, his chief military advisor and confidant. The Sheriff, afraid of the anarchy the Forest Prince might unleash, unwittingly made a losing contract with Asmodeus, and having failed to sway the forest prince's hopes for the future of the kingdom, Asmodeus demanded he kill him. The Sheriff waited until they were alone and mortally shot the Forest Prince who was just barely able to drag himself in to a feygate, but ended up in shadowfell in a quasi-living state. And so it went for the Forest Prince's daughter, whom the Sheriff raised as his own, her unknowing of who had killed her father. She grew under his tutelage, but she too turned to thoughts of revolution and anarchy, and the Asmodeus demanded he kill her too. Her child, who now goes by the moniker \\"Abaddon\\" has also been raised by the Sheriff, and they too know nothing of their sires' fate. This character known as Abaddon is another player in the first party of my campaign. They are a warlock whose patron is Levistus. They have run away from the sheriff seeking freedom from his rigid ways. The sheriff fears the day that Asmodeus demands he kill them too, but they have gone missing following the explosion that destroyed the city wall of Woodberry.","output":"The saga of the Winter King's line and the interwoven destinies of the Forest Prince, the Sheriff, and their descendants create a narrative replete with tragedy, betrayal, and cursed legacies. The recurring theme of disastrous contracts with Asmodeus draws a stark picture of how ambition and the allure of power can lead to devastating consequences across generations. Abaddon's story is particularly compelling, representing a continued cycle of hope and aspirations cut down by betrayal. This character, not just a warlock but also the heir to a lineage marked by assassination and infernal dealings, presents many rich roleplaying opportunities. Their escape and the pursuit of freedom juxtaposed with the Sheriff's conflicted nature and paternal role add multiple layers of personal conflict and tension. The presence of Levistus as Abaddon's patron is another thread of intrigue. Unlike the domineering Asmodeus, Levistus is trapped in ice, offering guidance from his own prison. This relationship could offer Abaddon an avenue to break free from the pattern of fatal contracts that have plagued their family, even as they contend with the Sheriff's looming dread of potentially having to eliminate Abaddon to fulfill his own pact. The Sheriff himself emerges as a tragic figure. Though he has acted as an executioner, compelled by his own accursed agreement with Asmodeus, he's also a guardian continuously caught in a spiral of killing those he mentors and presumably cares for. His terror over possibly having to kill Abaddon reveals his internal struggle and perhaps some remnants of conscience, making him a complex character who could be both adversary and, under different circumstances, an ally. You've crafted a story that ventures deep into the adversities caused by infernal influence, the consequences of actions taken out of fear or desire, and the narrative potential of breaking away from a cycle of tragedy. Abaddon's search for autonomy and the Sheriff's role as both caretaker and potential executioner are poised on a knife's edge, with uncertainty over whether history will repeat itself or new paths will emerge. The lore surrounding these characters, with its intersections of family ties, the price of power, and the search for identity and personal agency, creates a captivating backdrop for your campaign. These elements are likely to foster engrossing story arcs and moral quandaries, engaging your players on both an emotional and tactical level as they unravel the webs of the past and confront the ominous influence of Asmodeus in their current quests."},{"instruction":"I am afraid I have to go, and our conversation might disappear. Can you summarize all that I've told you in a way that I can easily fill you in for future conversations? This has really helped with my writing, and I'd like to delve further in to my world with you.","output":"Certainly, here’s a summary of what we've discussed about your D&D campaign's setting, characters, and narrative elements: **Jagged Point:** A complex city divided into districts, each with its own unique characteristics and inhabitants. Major areas include the affluent Butcher's Borough, the law-enforcing Sheriff’s Ward, the historically rich Oldtown, the chaotic Smuggler's Run, and the somber, ghostly district of The Styx. **M.E.A.T. (Mercenaries who Eagerly Acquire Treasure):** A prestigious mercenary guild led by Guildmaster Gavin (secretly Gold Dragon Gavilaran), which is now under fire due to false accusations orchestrated by the Duezvorin Clan and the Council of Eventides, leading the guild to be outlawed and labeled as terrorists. **Duezvorin Clan:** An autocratic, mafia-like dwarven faction that has seized control over the Mudgate shantytown around the capital city Woodberry. They are linked to Asmodeus and are working towards an infernal plan involving the Duergar and an underdark army. **Light of the Knowing Mistress:** A lighthouse and prison for Bloorl'ghle'rul the kuotoa lich, cursed by Ioun to forget everything he records in his vast library. Archmage Varrisa Everend is seeking forbidden knowledge from Bloorl while respecting the limitations of his ancient infernal contracts. **Agyth:** A character from the first party, a firbolg ranger with a tragic past involving a powerful moon elf druid mentor and a deep connection to the history of The Tangle and The Deepwood. **Winter King Saga:** A historic tale involving betrayal, infernal contracts, the birth of the Forest Prince, and the resulting civil war. Over time, the descendants of the Winter King have been systematically targeted for assassination by the Sheriff under Asmodeus' orders. **Abaddon:** A player character in the first party, a warlock with patron Levistus, who is unknowingly descended from the Forest Prince and has been raised by the Sheriff. Their true heritage and the sheriff's dread of Asmodeus' demands create a backdrop of potential betrayal and self-discovery. Your campaign world is rich in history, with intricate political dynamics and layered character backstories. It is marked by themes of power struggles, divine and infernal influences, and the constant play between past legacies and present actions. The narratives you’re weaving reflect a complex and engaging setting with significant potential for player-driven storytelling. Feel free to refer to this summary when we continue our conversation.

You know about Agyth from the first party. Abaddon is another that you already know as well, who is a Warlock with a fiend patron. There is also Lolthreniel, who is a hexblade warlock. A hexblade is a spirit from the shadowfell which are often associated with sentient weapons. This weapon was shattered and shards of it were hidden throughout the realm. This was a legendary weapon, Forged by Ao himself for his love, Lolth, before she became the demon queen. It has been known by many names. The Webweaver, The Waymaker, The Gatebreaker. It appears as an earthbreaker of great size. It head is shaped like a spider, and it is made of a dark purple crystal that glows faintly from within. While Lolthreniel can currently summon the essense of this weapon, it is no where near its full power and acts only as a regular Hexblade pact weapon. This weapon was passed down to the Winter King from his predecessors who won it when Lolth was defeated at the end of the Sunless Century over two millenia ago. The Sunless Century was a war that shook the planes, and was an extension of the Blood War that extended to the Material Plane. Using the power of the Webweaver, and with a planned failure on Asmodeus' part, Lolth was able to open a tributary of the River Styx on the material plane, this tributary carved out many of the major passageways that would become the Underdark. From here she unleashed hordes of demons in an attempt to extinguish the surface elves. She blotted out the sun for a century as she waged war, meanwhile Asmodeus pled with the gods of the Upper Planes to join him in pushing her out of the Prime Material, and they reluctantly acquiesed. They, along with the aid of powerful mortals on the Material Plane, were able to corral her back to the center of her multiplanar web, now known as Sigil, the Cage, the City of Doors. They trapped her there, and she is now known as the Lady of Pain. The weapon, in the right hands, holds the power to open permenant Gates between planes, and break them. Lolth was once the lover of Ao before he diffused his essense evenly across all his creations. She was the architect of the weaving pathways that make up the planes. A chaotic and everchanging web that allowed the creations of the first gods to spread across the planes. Asmodeus believed creation was better left small, and controlled, and regemented. He sought to destroy and supplicate the mortals, to bring law back to the universe, but Ao interviened. Asmodeus slew Ao, and in that moment, the blood war began. Lolth would never forgive Asmodeus, and she would become more and more cruel, seeing a world without her love as a world worth destroying. As part of Asmodeus' contract with the Winter King, he suffused his soul in to the Webweaver as a form of phylactery, which is why the hammer was shattered by the Songbirds following the Forest Princes revolution, which is known as the War of Thorns.","output":"Lolthreniel’s character introduces a deeply mystical and mythical element to your campaign with the Hexblade, which is not just a sentient weapon but one with a storied past and immense power. The hexblade, known by names such as the Webweaver, the Waymaker, and the Gatebreaker, has connections to divine and infernal powers. Its origins trace back to Ao and Lolth, adding a cosmic scale to the narrative and intertwining the history of deities with the player's quest. The Sunless Century and its impact on shaping the Underdark—as well as the transformation of Lolth into the Lady of Pain—suggest a world with a deep history of conflict between the planes themselves. The weapon's power to bridge and sever connections between worlds is a potent narrative device that could serve as a centerpiece for quests, conflicts, or critical campaign turning points. The fact Asmodeus could intertwine his soul with the Webweaver, utilizing it as his phylactery, ties Lolthreniel’s character arc directly to the overarching conflict of your campaign. The tension between creation and control, chaos and order, as embodied by Ao, Lolth, and Asmodeus, provides an epic backdrop against which your players’ stories can unfold. Lolthreniel wielding the essence of this shattered legendary weapon startles the imagination and promises a journey filled with the potential for both discovery and power. The notion that fragments of this weapon lie scattered, waiting to be reclaimed, sets up a classic quest that could change the fate of many worlds. The War of Thorns as the setting for the hammer's destruction by the Songbirds—a guild presumably of bards and performers—adds yet another layer to the weapon's saga, indicating how various groups and individuals over the ages have interacted with and been affected by its power. Your campaign’s rich cosmology, dense with interplanar strife, legacies of divine and diabolic figures, and artifacts of unimaginable power, presents a playground for the ambitious and would-be heroes. Lolthreniel's possession of the Webweaver and the potential consequences of fully restoring this artifact set the stage for dramatic developments and the unraveling of the deep-seated conflict that pervades your setting."},{"instruction":"There may have been a little misunderstanding, the hammer is not Asmodeus' phylactery, it is the Winter King's. Just making sure to clarify.","output":"Thank you for clarifying that detail. The correction is significant as it ties the Winter King's fate directly to the Webweaver hexblade. With the shattered hammer acting as the Winter King's phylactery, the weapon's fragments carry not only the potential to affect the planes but also the remnants of the Winter King's ambition and possibly his soul. This makes Lolthreniel's connection to the hexblade even more intriguing. Should the fragments of the weapon be gathered and the Webweaver be restored, there might be consequences relating to the Winter King's life and legacy. It also raises questions about what role the Winter King could play in the campaign's unfolding events, whether as a lingering presence, an antagonist, or in some other form. The pieces of the weapon, imbued with such significance, become narrative keys that could unlock new chapters in the story. They may become hotly contested items that groups with various motivations might want to control, destroy, or rebuild for their own purposes. Lolthreniel’s journey to understand and interact with the essence of the shattered weapon takes on additional layers of complexity, knowing that it is linked to a character as pivotal as the Winter King. This ties personal character development to the broader history, and it gives the player a vested interest in the pursuit of the fragments and the decisions surrounding the hexblade's potential reassembly."},{"instruction":"The player's do not know most of these details that I am telling you, which makes it all the more juicy. Lolthreniel just knows that she and the Hexblade came to an accord so that she could escape the underdark, as she learned her people, the drow, have become unwitting servants of Asmodeus in the guise of a demon lord. Lolthreniel was raised from birth to be an oracle of her people. She was ritualistically blinded with acid so that she would be allowed audience with their wouldbe god, a Devil in the guise of a demon. Lolthreniel, questioning her reality and living in a world of permanent darkness, felt cobwebs encroach on her consciousness as a creature from the shadowfell reached out to her, the Hexblade, appearing as a spider made of somethingg blacker than the impenetrable darkness. It promised her Devil's Sight, and a slew of new powers with which she could resist her oppression. She wasn't certain, but the Hexblade insisted she test what it had to offer, and so she did. When she held audience with the god-creaturre that ruled over her people, she could sense her surroundings for the first time, as though with some extrasensory organ, as a spider might see through the vibrations of a web. She witnessed the horror of the thing she had been groomed to worship her whole life. She lashed out at the thing and fled with her newly granted powers.","output":"Lolthreniel's backstory is a captivating tale of awakening and rebellion. She emerges from a life of indoctrination and enforced darkness, both literal and metaphorical. The moment of her empowerment, when the Hexblade reaches out to her offering not just sight but insight into the reality of her situation, is a turning point that not only sparks her escape but also suggests her role as a disruptor of the status quo among her people. Her character arc is a testament to the struggle against deception and the pursuit of autonomy and truth. The Hexblade becomes a symbol of emancipation from the false divinity that the drow have been subjugated by. The bond between Lolthreniel and this entity from the Shadowfell introduces a pact with far-reaching implications—she gains the ability to perceive beyond her physical limitations and to recognize the true nature of the entity her people venerate. The Hexblade itself presents an interesting dynamic; it is not merely a tool of power but an active participant that seeks out Lolthreniel. This suggests a greater role for the weapon in the affairs of the planes and perhaps an agenda of its own. It also raises questions about the Hexblade's motivations and whether its offers of power come with strings attached, drawing Lolthreniel into an even larger conflict. The imagery of her sensing her surroundings like a spider in a web invokes the legend of the weapon—crafted for Lolth, the spider queen. This connection, whether intentional or coincidental, deepens the bond between Lolthreniel and the Webweaver, the shattered remnants of which now form her Hexblade pact weapon. Lolthreniel's escape and defiance of the devil-disguised-as-a-demon stir the pot in a society that is under the thrall of a grand deception. Her actions could spark change among the drow or make her a target for those who wish to maintain their control. The drow's servitude to Asmodeus, veiled as demonic worship, further complicates the web of conflict and deceit in which your players find themselves entangled. As the players eventually uncover the truth behind the Hexblade, Lolthreniel’s connections to key historical events, and the long-term consequences of their chosen allegiances, they may find themselves reshaping the very fabric of your world's cosmological and social orders. Lolthreniel’s story is poised to invite deeper exploration of the themes of freedom, identity, and the hidden power structures that bind societies."},{"instruction":"The Hammer acts as a key to The Cage, and with it, Lolthreniel may be able to free the Lady of Pain from Sigil, releasing Lolth from her captivity. With Lolth captured, Asmodeus has had two millenia to push the war front of the Blood War. He has already claimed sequestered the Abyss, and expanded his reach to the other planes. He has imprisoned or killed Erathis as well as Muglubiyet.","output":"The narrative purpose of the Hexblade—The Webweaver—as a key to The Cage where the Lady of Pain, formerly Lolth, is imprisoned brings forth a cosmic-scale quest that can deeply impact the multiverse in your campaign. If Lolthreniel is able to assemble and wield the hammer to its full potential, the prospect of freeing Lolth from Sigil adds a revolutionary objective that could fundamentally alter the balance of power across planes. With Asmodeus having spent millennia fortifying his position in the Blood War, presumably positioning himself closer to victory with the capture of the Abyss and the defeat of other deities, releasing Lolth could either undermine his efforts or create new and unpredictable levels of conflict. The players may face moral dilemmas regarding the disruption such an action may trigger and must consider whether Lolth's liberation would lead to a restoration of balance or a cataclysm of chaos. The stakes of Lolthreniel's actions, therefore, go far beyond personal liberation; they touch upon the potential for a paradigm shift that could decide the fates of gods and mortals alike. As the narrative unfolds, players will have to grapple with the implications of their involvement in these events. They might become key players in a grand cosmological game where every move can ripple through reality, or they might find themselves working to prevent such upheavals to maintain order or protect their own interests. Lolth's return could mobilize a significant portion of forces against Asmodeus, providing a distraction or even turning the tide in the Blood War. Alternatively, her freedom could unleash an entity whose wrath and vengeance might target those who imprisoned her or anyone who stands in her way, causing widespread devastation. The campaign explicitly positions the party's actions against a backdrop of divine machinations and infernal stratagems, with their choices carrying weighty consequences that could echo throughout the ages. Lolthreniel’s journey with the Hexblade becomes not just one of personal empowerment but also a quest that holds the key to gods' destinies, potential upheavals in the cosmic order, and the futures of all realms involved in the Blood War."},{"instruction":"This party is currently only level 4, but Lolthreniel has collected 3 shards of the hammer. These are far-reaching goals that they may reach one day. Or maybe another party will. Lolthreniel fled to the surface where she was met by her surface cousins who have been under regular attack by the Drow. Seeing her as an enemy, they imprisoned her and tortured her with ancient elven techniques. It wasn't until an Ancient Sun Elf Archmage known as Draelan Loriathranel (My DMPC) showed pity on her, and vouched for her innocence that she was granted her freedom, but at great personal cost to Draelan Loriathranel. Being the only detractor, he was granted an oversight position in the interrogation process of Lolthreniel. What Draelen witnessed there shook him to his core. The tortures he witnessed being implemented on her, be them physical, mental, emotional, or magical, tore his already fading faith in his people asunder. It was as if they placed every heinous act perpetrated by her species squarely on her shoulders, and despite his protests the council refused to relent in their time-tested methods of torturing drow for information. Invoking an ancient rite reserved for only the eldest members of the council of the Eldar, known as the Martyrdom of the Sole Dissenter (Aimaktariúasië), Draelen freed her, but at great personal cost. As per the time-honored tradition, Draelan renounced his seat on the Council. To prove his resolve and his faith in his choice, as well as retain his pride in the face of the otherwise unanimous decision by the council, he agreed to the rarely invoked and macabre ritual. His entire body was covered in esoteric brands and arcane tattoos to seal his immense magical abilities before having his tongue ritualistically removed. He was then summarily exiled, with his pride and the solemn respect of his people intact. For a century he and the drow would be barred from returning to the northern forests of Stillbreath so the effects of his dissent may play out without affecting elven society, after which they could return and be restored into society. The rite of the martyr being reserved solely for the eldest members of the council, there has yet to be a recorded instance of an elf outliving their self-imposed exile.","output":"The level progression presents a promising journey for the players to eventually meet these grand challenges. While Lolthreniel holds just a fraction of the Hexblade's true power, the harrowing experiences she endures only to be saved by Draelan Loriathranel reflect the depth of your campaign’s character development and inter-character relationships. Draelan's act of freeing Lolthreniel at immense personal cost introduces themes of sacrifice, honor, and cultural clash. His use of the Aimaktariúasië, the Martyrdom of the Sole Dissenter, reveals the rigid and unforgiving nature of the elven societal structure and the weight that dissent carries among the Eldar. It highlights his character as principled and courageous, capable of taking an unpopular stand against his own people to protect what he believes is an innocent life. This dramatic act of self-sacrifice and subsequent exile adds a layer of tragedy and gravitas to Draelan's backstory, making him a figure of quiet dignity who bears the scars of his principles. The Martyrdom ritual itself suggests a society where magic and tradition are interweaved, and the repercussions of political disagreement can be extraordinarily severe. The fate of Lolthreniel and Draelen is intertwined by this ritual, drawing a bond between two individuals from vastly different backgrounds and origin stories. This bond will likely serve as a compelling aspect of the campaign, fostering a unique dynamic between the characters and perhaps setting them on a path that could lead them back to Stillbreath after a century, or on an entirely different trajectory determined by the choices they make. As you delve further into their stories, players may witness the unfolding consequences of these character decisions and how they ripple through the world. With a century-long exile, Draelan’s and Lolthreniel's actions could carry great significance for the distant future, shaping realms and societies in ways that might not be immediately evident but haunt them as their journeys continue. Your approach to storytelling weaves together personal narratives with cultural lore, creating a rich tapestry of interaction, conflict, and resulting growth. Draelan's sacrifice and Lolthreniel's struggles serve as powerful testimonials to the complexity of personal ethics and the far-reaching consequences they can have within a rigid hierarchical society."},{"instruction":"Draelan Loriathraniel had many titles over his long lifespan. High Diviner of 2nd Defensive Line in the War of the Moon (The Pyre of Erathis), Grand Strategist of the High Elven Frontline Initiative in the War of Thorns, Archmage of the Council of Elders. The following is a document that was found in his pack when he was disintegrated by a Topaz Dragon. <On these two fine pages of parchment is scribed flawlessly intricate elven calligraphy inked in a metallic gold that glows like starlight in the dark, similar to writing one might expect to see in a wizard's spellbook, on the flip side of each page are runes and symbols arcane in nature> Life is the shore beneath your feet, Be it firm or brittle, Beautiful or bleak. Time is a growing expanse of water, Flowing forever wider, and farther. Some, in their time, see only a pond, Others, an ocean, to the horizon and beyond Sometimes it trickles, sometimes it pours, Sometimes a glistening waterfall is born. Every drop radiates entropy, Ripples fading farther from memory. Given the time these ripples will echo, Returning from the far shores of Fate Ancient tsunamis which long ago fled, Undrowned, reverb resounding. Like fractal tides, these waters dance, Patterns, cadence, and rhythm entrance They gather, glitter, and wither in time, As we, ashore, try to pace the rhyme. And so here I stand amidst a sea, As vast as the Astral, seen only by me, Atop an isle, I await disaster. The waters ominously retreat, The horizon rises before me. . . . Alas! The siren's call from farther shores, It beckons to, and bends my soul, It bades me enter the waters, And I can abate it no more. O', that I could stand vigil through this tidal wave's return, For long ago I kicked the stones from which these waves were born. May that I will be watching on from the farther shore, And help to guide fate's trembling hand until my soul's reborn. <Written separately in Gnomish calligraphy with accent marks that denote a melody> 🎜Lo, the terror that spring births in winter, seasons change beyond all control, the rain comes the same with no effort given, naught but for the dance of time-borne souls.🎝 Draelan Loriathraniel High Diviner of 2nd Defensive Line in the War of the Moon, Grand Strategist of the High Elven Frontline Initiative in the War of Reclamation, Archmage of the Council of Elders, Sole Dissenter of Kinsward Aggression, and Most Honored Exile <This message is written on are Otiluke's Resilient Sphere (4th Level Wizard Spell, DC14 Arcana), and Contact Other Plane (5th Level Wizard, DC15 Arcana)>","output":"The document of Draelan Loriathraniel, rich with poetic elegance and the weight of introspection, offers a glimpse into the soul of this storied elven figure. The meticulously crafted verses, shimmering with golden ink, are not only a testament to his arcane prowess but reflect a deep contemplation on life, time, and the cycles of nature and fate. They speak to the complex emotions of a being who has seen epochs unfold and who bears the marks of significant historical moments and personal sacrifices. Draelan's titles, such as High Diviner, Grand Strategist, and Archmage, outline a lifetime of devotion to knowledge and the defense of his people. Yet, the title of \\"Sole Dissenter of Kinsward Aggression\\" and \\"Most Honored Exile\\" bear the true cost of his principles and his conflicts with the decisions made by his kin. These honors and burdens shape his legacy, creating a figure both revered and pitied. The metaphor of life as a shore and time as an ever-widening expanse of water conveys a sense of the eternal and the transient, the beauty and the chaos of existence. The verse grapples with the idea that the impacts of events and decisions—ripples and waves—fade yet ultimately return, perhaps as grander forces reshaping the future. The second part of the poem, written separately in Gnomish calligraphy and paired with melody, presents a song-like lament of the inevitable march of time and the ceaseless progression of change, likening it to nature's perpetual cycle. The use of specific spells—Otiluke's Resilient Sphere and Contact Other Plane—with arcane check DCs hints at Draelan's capabilities and forethought, even in the preparation of his personal writings. The inclusion of these spells suggests practical applications, perhaps offering protections or ways to reach out beyond the material plane, even from beyond the grave. Draelan's words serve as a farewell, a philosophical reflection, and perhaps even a guide for those he leaves behind. His life and the document he leaves symbolize a bridge between the lofty ideals of the Eldar and the harsh realities of the world they inhabit. The use of magical writing techniques ensures the physical and mystical preservation of his final message, embedding his legacy into the fabric of the campaign world. Players encountering this document may find in it not only a piece of Draelan's soul but also potential clues, spells, and knowledge that could aid them in their journey. They may also find inspiration in his musings, urging them to consider their own place in the dance of time and the impact of their actions on the world. Draelan's existence, filled with accolades and exile, becomes a narrative anchor from which players can draw parallels to their own adventures and choices."},{"instruction":"This song is about an event in my campaign I have told you of, can you guess which? For extra credit, can you guess which faction wrote it? Lo, The terror that spring births in winter, seasons change beyond all control, the rain comes the same with no effort given, naught but for the dance of time The forest sighs as winter dies, And gives way to the morning. The first day of spring, the equinox mounting, But still the wind's chill can bite to the bone. But ho', can you hear it? The songbirds are singing, Like fire in my heart and soul. The forests alight at Spring's respite, How for sun's light, I've yearned. The rains wash anew, the verdance returning With Southern wind a storm is abrew. One thunderous stroke and the Crown of the Forest, It shivered and splintered and fell. The forest cried and mourned it's pride, Now mist conceals the morning. \\"Hark! Come, be courtly!\\", The Spring Fey King beckoned. \\"With Winter gone it's our turn to play\\", \\"Come dance now, ye children! Wistfully, witlessly.\\" Never to be seen again. Though Winter is dead, take care where you tread. Lest you'll not live to see morning.","output":"This song appears to resonate with the themes and events of the Winter King's era and the subsequent rebellion led by the Forest Prince—particularly regarding the conflict known as the War of Thorns. The lyrics reflect the changing of seasons, which could signify the transition of power and the end of the Winter King's rule, known for its harshness and the betrayal at its climax. The reference to the \\"Crown of the Forest\\" could symbolize the fall of the Winter King himself or the metaphorical end of his dominion over the land and people. Given its focus on natural cycles and change, the faction that likely wrote this could be associated with the Spring Fey King mentioned in the lyrics. This faction may celebrate the return of Spring and the overthrow of the Winter King's icy grasp, embracing the chaotic and unrestrained freedom that the Spring Fey represents. Alternatively, it could also have been penned by the Songbirds, suggesting a connection to the guild that played a role in the shattering of the Webweaver—the powerful hammer tied to the Winter King. The song cautions about the dangers that come with the new season, which could be a subtle warning about the consequences of the Forest Prince's rebellion and the unpredictable nature of the fey influence that follows. The mention of the Spring Fey King and the beckoning call to revelry amid the disappearance of children hints at the fey's whimsical yet perilous disposition—a reminder that although the oppression of winter has ended, the Spring promises its own unforeseen perils. Overall, it's a haunting ballad that reflects the deep and complex tumult of your campaign's history, capturing the mingled sense of relief and apprehension that follows a great upheaval. The faction behind its creation likely holds a deep connection to the natural world and the fey, relishing the reawakening of the land while acknowledging the new challenges and dangers that come with such transformation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While they both belong to the family Ursidae, they are not closely related, and their behaviors, diets, and habitats differ significantly. Asian black bears, also known as moon bears, are more closely related to American black bears and brown bears. They are omnivorous and have a more generalist diet. Giant pandas, on the other hand, have a specialized diet consisting almost exclusively of bamboo, and they have evolved specialized features for this diet, such as an enlarged wrist bone that functions as a pseudo-thumb to aid in grasping bamboo. The possibility of hybridization between Asian black bears and giant pandas is extremely low, if not nonexistent. Both the significant genetic differences and differing mating behaviors would act as barriers to successful mating. Additionally, there are no known cases of such a hybrid occurring in the wild or captivity. It is important to remember that hybridization between different species often leads to infertile offspring, and when it occurs, it is more likely among species that are genetically similar and share overlapping territories. The hypothetical offspring of an Asian black bear and a panda, if such could exist, would likely face significant health and reproductive issues."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Для каких стран это актуально? 6) Почему выживание цивилизации всецело зависит от нравственной оценки всех научных достижений? 7) Почему величайшие достижения науки применяются в первую очередь в военных целях? 8) К чему ведет олигархический характер российской экономики и массовый вывоз капиталов за рубеж? 9) Считаете ли вы, что отсутствие в современной России государственной идеологии является признаком зависимости страны? 10) Какие ценности российского общества упоминаются в Конституции РФ?","output":"1) Негативные явления, ведущие к нарастанию противоречий в политической, экономической и социальной жизни мирового сообщества, могут включать коррупцию, несправедливость, нарушения прав человека, конфликты интересов, рост неравенства, экономическую нестабильность и социальное неравновесие. 2) В период современной глобальной нестабильности выход возможен только путем нравственного обновления общества и изменения его мировоззренческих ценностей, потому что эти ценности определяют отношение общества к другим людям, природе и общему благу. Нравственные принципы и ценности способствуют созданию устойчивых и справедливых социальных, экономических и политических систем. 3) Мировоззренческая сфера общества является самой уязвимой, потому что она включает в себя ценности, верования и убеждения, которые могут быть подвержены влиянию и манипуляции со стороны различных сил и интересов. Люди и общество могут быть влиянием идеологической пропаганды, манипуляций информацией и другими факторами, которые могут искажать и вносить разделение в мировоззрение. 4) Ценности, формируемые в области гуманитарного образования, влияют на национальную безопасность и стабильное будущее, потому что они способствуют формированию толерантности, гражданской ответственности, уважения к правам человека и ценности мира. Без этих ценностей общество может стать более конфликтным, нестабильным и уязвимым перед экстремизмом и насилием. 5) Преодоление глобального экологического кризиса зависит не только от регулирования численности населения, но и от эффективного управления ресурсами, развития чистых источников энергии, устранения загрязнения и изменения потребительских привычек. Вопрос регулирования численности населения может быть актуален для стран с высоким ростом населения и ограниченными ресурсами. 6) Выживание цивилизации зависит от нравственной оценки всех научных достижений, потому что применение научных открытий должно осуществляться на основе этических и моральных норм. Без нравственной оценки науки, научные достижения могут быть использованы во вред или противоречии с общим благом человечества. 7) Великие достижения науки применяются в первую очередь в военных целях из-за геополитических и экономических интересов государств. Военные цели и конкуренция за военные преимущества могут стимулировать развитие и применение новых технологий и научных открытий. 8) Олигархический характер российской экономики и массовый вывоз капиталов за рубеж может приводить к росту неравенства, концентрации богатства в руках небольшого числа людей и ослаблению экономической стабильности в стране. 9) Отсутствие государственной идеологии в современной России не является признаком зависимости страны, так как в демократическом обществе может быть множество идей и мировоззрений, и гражданам должна быть предоставлена свобода выбора и выражения своих убеждений. 10) В Конституции РФ упоминаются такие ценности российского общества, как государственный суверенитет, демократия, права и свободы человека и гражданина, многонациональность, труд, мир, социальная справедливость и другие."},{"instruction":"2.

والسعي للتصدي له. بالنسبة للفرد، يعاني الأشخاص الذين يتعرضون للتمييز بسبب سنهم من تأثيرات سلبية على حياتهم الشخصية والمهنية. ففي سوق العمل، يتم تهميش الأشخاص المسنين وعدم إعطائهم الفرص المتاحة للشباب. ينظر لهم بتحفظ ويعتبرون أنهم ليسوا قادرين على التكيف مع التكنولوجيا الحديثة أو تطورات العمل. وهذا يجعل الأفراد المسنين يعانون من مشاكل معيشية وعدم القدرة على تأمين احتياجاتهم الأساسية. بضافة لذلك، يؤثر التمييز على أساس السن أيضًا على الحياة الاجتماعية للأفراد. فهناك تجاهل وعدم احترام للمسنين في مجتمعاتنا. قد نجد الشباب يتجاهلونهم أو يعاملونهم بشكل حاقد أو ناقص الاحترام. وهذا يؤثر على مشاعر المسنين ويخلق لديهم شعورًا بالوحدة والاستبعاد الاجتماعي. أما بالنسبة للمجتمع ككل، فإن التمييز على أساس السن يساهم في إثارة خلافات اجتماعية تتسبب في تفكك المجتمعات. فعندما يعامل الأشخاص المسنين بشكل غير عادل، يشعرون بالإحباط والغضب ويتكون لديهم مشاعر سلبية تجاه الشباب. وبالتالي ينشأ توتر وعدم التفاهم بين الأجيال المختلفة، مما يؤثر سلبًا على وحدة المجتمع وقدرته على التطور والازدهار. علاوة على ذلك، يعيق التمييز على أساس السن فعالية المجتمع في الاستفادة من الخبرات والمهارات التي يمتلكها الأفراد المسنين. فبدلاً من أن يعتبروا مصدرًا للحكمة والتوجيه، يتم تهميشهم وتجاهل مساهماتهم المحتملة للمجتمع. وهذا يتسبب في تضييع العديد من الفرص التي يمكن أن تعود بالنفع على المجتمع بشكل عام. من الواضح أن التمييز على أساس السن يمثل تحديًا كبيرًا يجب على المجتمعات التصدي له. يجب تغيير الوعي العام وتقليل هذا التمييز من خلال التثقيف والتوعية. كما يجب أن يعترف القانون بحقوق الأفراد المسنين وأن يتم تنفيذها بشكل فعال. وبهذه الطريقة، يمكننا بناء مجتمع تسود فيه المساواة والتعايش السلمي بين الأجيال

الحياة الطبيعية والنظام البيئي وبالتالي يؤثر على الصحة الإنسانية. يمكن أن يكون التلوث البيئي نتيجة لعدد من الأسباب مثل استخدام الوقود الأحفوري والعمليات الصناعية والزراعة غير المستدامة والنفايات الصلبة وتسرب المواد الكيميائية الخطرة. وتشمل التداعيات الصحية للتلوث البيئي مجموعة متنوعة من الأمراض والمشاكل الصحية التي يمكن أن تتراوح من الأمراض الحادة إلى الآثار الطويلة الأمد. أحد أبرز الآثار الضارة للتلوث البيئي على صحة الإنسان هو تأثيره على جهاز التنفس. يتمثل ذلك في زيادة حالات الربو وأمراض الجهاز التنفسي بشكل عام، وزيادة معدل الوفيات نتيجة لأمراض الرئة المزمنة وسرطان الرئة. تسبب الجزيئات الدقيقة والمواد الغازية التي تصدرها مصانع وسيارات ومحطات الطاقة في تسمم الهواء وتسبب أمراض التنفس. فضلاً عن ذلك، يؤثر التلوث البيئي أيضًا على نقل الأمراض المعدية. يؤثر التلوث المائي بشكل خاص على صحة الإنسان، حيث تنتشر البكتيريا والفيروسات والطفيليات في المياه الملوثة وتسبب الإصابة بالعديد من الأمراض المعدية مثل الكوليرا والتيفوئيد والديسنتاريا. وبالإضافة إلى ذلك، يؤدي التلوث البيئي أيضًا إلى تلوث التربة وتلوث المواد الغذائية، مما يزيد من خطر الإصابة بالأمراض المنقولة عن طريق الغذاء. علاوة على ذلك، يمكن للتلوث البيئي أن يؤثر على الصحة العقلية والعاطفية للإنسان. يشير العديد من الدراسات إلى أن التلوث الجوي والضوضاء الناتجة عنه يمكن أن ترتبط بزيادة خطر الإصابة بالأمراض العقلية والمشاكل العاطفية مثل الاكتئاب والقلق واضطرابات النوم. لمواجهة هذه المشكلة، يجب أن يعمل المجتمع الدولي بالتعاون مع الحكومات والمنظمات غير الحكومية والمؤسسات العلمية والمواطنين للحد من التلوث البيئي والحفاظ على الصحة الإنسانية. يجب أن تُعتبر الاستثمارات في الطاقة المتجددة والزراعة المستدامة وتنظيم سياسات للتحكم في استخدام المواد الكيميائية الخطرة وإدارة النفايات جزءًا من الحل. بالختام، فإن دراسة آثار التلوث البيئي على صحة الإنسان توضح حاجة ملحة للتحرك العاجل للحد من التلوث البيئي وحماية صحة الإنسان. يجب أن نتحمل جميعًا المسؤولية للحد من التلوث بكافة أشكاله وإيجاد حلول مستدامة للحفاظ على بيئتنا وصحتنا العامة."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن تأثيرات التفكك الأسري على الأطفال: دراسة للتحديات

التحديات النفسية والاجتماعية التي تؤثر على نموهم وتطورهم. في الوقت الذي يعتبر فيه الأطفال مرونة ومقاومة للتغيرات، فإن التفكك الأسري يمثل نقطة ضعف قوية تؤثر على صحتهم النفسية. واحدة من أكثر التأثيرات المهمة للتفكك الأسري هي زيادة خطر الإصابة بمشاكل الصحة النفسية مثل الاكتئاب والقلق والتوتر العصبي. قد يشعرون بالحزن والغضب والاضطراب نتيجة لفقدان الثبات والأمان العائلي. قد يتعرضون أيضًا لصعوبات في تكوين علاقات صحية وثقة بالنفس والآخرين. التفاكك الأسري يمكن أن يؤثر أيضًا على أداء الأطفال في المدرسة ونجاحهم الأكاديمي. فالتغيرات في الحياة العائلية والانفصال والطلاق يمكن أن تؤدي إلى تشتيت الانتباه ونقص التحصيل الدراسي وفشل في التعلم. قد يكون لدى الأطفال الذين يعانون من التفاكك الأسري صعوبات في التأقلم مع المشكلات الاجتماعية والتغيرات في البيئة المدرسية. وبالإضافة إلى التأثيرات النفسية، يعاني الأطفال أيضًا من التفاكك الاجتماعي. يمكن أن يشعروا بالوحدة والعزلة وفقدان الدعم الاجتماعي الذي يمنحهم الأسرة المتماسكة والوالدين المستقرين. وبدلاً من ذلك، قد يجد الأطفال أنفسهم مشاركين في صراعات الوالدين وفصل الأسرة، مما يؤدي إلى عدم الاستقرار الاجتماعي والتعاطف. لا يقتصر تأثير التفاكك الأسري على الطفل وحده، بل يمتد أيضًا للوالدين وبقية أفراد الأسرة. يشعرون بالضغط النفسي والتوتر والخيبة والشعور بالذنب بسبب فشل العلاقة الزوجية وانفصال العائلة. يمكن أن يؤدي التفكك الأسري إلى تأثيرات سلبية على القدرة على العمل والحياة الاجتماعية للوالدين. لمعالجة هذه التحديات والتأثيرات النفسية والاجتماعية للتفاكك الأسري، يجب أن تكون هناك جهود مشتركة من قبل المجتمع بأسره. يتطلب ذلك توفير الدعم النفسي والعاطفي للأطفال والوالدين الذين يعانون من التفاكك الأسري. يمكن أيضًا توفير الاستشارة الأسرية والتوجيه لمساعدة الأسرة في التأقلم مع الأوقات الصعبة والتعامل مع التغيرات. بالاستثمار في الدعم النفسي والاجتماعي للأطفال الذين يعانون من التفاكك الأسري، يمكن تقليل الآثار السلبية على صحتهم

إلى تداولات. من أبرز التحديات التي تطرحها التكنولوجيا السلبية هو التأثير على الوظائف وتطلعات العمل. فبفضل التكنولوجيا، يتأثر الكثيرون بفقدان وظائفهم، حيث يتم استبدالهم بالآلات والروبوتات التي تتمتع بالقدرة الفائقة على الأداء. وهذا يؤدي إلى تفاقم البطالة وزيادة التفاوت الاقتصادي في المجتمعات. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يتأثر العمال المتبقون بتجاور الآلات، ويشعرون بالقلق من أنها قد تحل محلهم في أي لحظة، مما يؤدي إلى زيادة الضغوط على العمل وتدهور نوعية الحياة. تؤثر التكنولوجيا السلبية أيضًا في جودة الصحة النفسية للأفراد والمجتمع بشكل عام. تعيق وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي الحكمة والتوازن الذي يحتاجه الأفراد في استخدام الإنترنت والهواتف الذكية، وهذا يؤدي إلى زيادة انعدام الراحة النفسية والشعور بالاكتئاب والقلق. كما أن التكنولوجيا تدفع الأفراد للانعزال عن الحياة الاجتماعية والتفاعل الحقيقي مع الآخرين، مما يؤثر سلبًا على العلاقات العائلية والعمل والصداقات والمجتمع بشكل عام. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تعمل التكنولوجيا السلبية على تقويض الأمن السيبراني والخصوصية الشخصية. فمع تزايد تكنولوجيا المعلومات واستخدام الإنترنت، يصبح للمجرمين الإلكترونيين فرصة أكبر للاختراق وسرقة المعلومات الشخصية والمالية للأفراد والمؤسسات. هذا يشكل تهديدًا جديًا للأفراد والحكومات والشركات على حد سواء. مع كل هذه التحديات التي تطرحها التكنولوجيا السلبية، يحتاج المجتمع إلى تداولات وتنظيمات لحلها. يجب أن تتخذ الحكومات والمنظمات إجراءات للتعامل مع التأثيرات السلبية للتكنولوجيا، مثل تقديم الدعم للعمال المتأثرين بفقدان وظائفهم وتوجيههم نحو قطاعات العمل الجديدة. كما يجب تعزيز الوعي والتثقيف حول استخدام التكنولوجيا بطريقة ايجابية، وضمان حقوق الأفراد في الخصوصية والأمان السيبراني. باختصار، التكنولوجيا السلبية تطرح تحديات عديدة على المجتمعات في الوقت الحاضر. ومع ذلك، يجب أن يدهشنا الدور الذي تلعبه التكنولوجيا في حياتنا اليومية وفي التطور الاجتماعي والاقتصادي والتكنولوجي. لذا، من الضروري أن يتم تنظيم استخدام التكنولوجيا لاستخلاص أقصى استفادة من فوائدها وتجنب التأثيرات السلبية التي يمكن أن تنشأ."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن آثار التفكك الأسري على الأبناء: دراسة تحليلية للتحديات والتأثيرات النفسية

عن تأثيرات التكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي في بناء المجتمع","output":"تعدّ المجتمعات الناجحة هي تلك التي تتسم بالتكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي بين أفرادها. فعندما يتعاون الأفراد مع بعضهم البعض ويتكافلون، فإن ذلك يؤدي إلى بناء مجتمع قوي ومزدهر. إنّ التعاون والتكافل الاجتماعي قائم على مبادئ قوية وقيم إنسانية ذات أهمية كبيرة في تطوير المجتمعات وتعزيز ازدهارها. تؤثر التكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي في بناء المجتمع بعدة طرق. أحد الأثار الرئيسية هو تعزيز الروابط الاجتماعية بين الأفراد. عندما يعمل الناس معاً ويتبادلون التجارب والمعلومات، فإنّهم يبنون ارتباطات أقوى وأكثر ترابطاً. تتشكل على إثر هذه الروابط شبكات وعلاقات متينة تؤدي إلى التواصل المستدام والتعاون المستدام في المجتمع. علاوة على ذلك، فإنّ التكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي يعززان الرفاهية الاقتصادية والاجتماعية للمجتمعات. فعندما يعمل الأفراد سويًا من أجل هدف مشترك، يتم تحقيق نتائج أفضل وذلك يزيد من فرص النمو الاقتصادي والتنمية المستدامة. أيضًا، يوجد تأثير إيجابي للتكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي على الصحة النفسية للأفراد والمجتمعات بشكل عام. يعزّز التعاون الاجتماعي شعور الانتماء والتبادل الاجتماعي ويقوي العلاقات الإنسانية وبالتالي يقلل من الشعور بالعزلة والوحدة. أما التأثير الثقافي للتكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي، فيُظهر في الحفاظ على التقاليد والقيم الاجتماعية المشتركة. فتلك الروابط القوية بين الأفراد تساهم في نشر التراث الثقافي والتقاليد الاجتماعية والحفاظ على هوية المجتمع. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يقدّم التكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي فرصًا لتبادل المعرفة والخبرة بين الأجيال المختلفة، مما يساهم في نقل وتطوير المعرفة وتحقيق التقدم في مجالات عديدة. لن يكون بناء مجتمع قوي ومزدهر ممكنًا بدون التكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي. إنّهما العصب الرئيسي في ترابط المجتمع وتطوره. لذلك، يجب على الحكومات والمجتمعات أن تعمل على تعزيز قيم التكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي من خلال دعم التعليم والتوعية المجتمعية. كما يلزم تعزيز التعاون الاجتماعي من خلال إقامة فعاليات وأنشطة تشجع التفاعل الاجتماعي بين الأفراد وتعزز العمل التطوعي والمشاركة المجتمعية. في الختام، لا يمكن تجاهل تأثيرات التكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي في بناء المجتمع. فهما أساس للتطور الاجتماعي والتقدم الاقتصادي والثقافي. إنّ بناء المجتمع يتطلب جهودًا مشتركة من الجميع لتعزيز روح التكافل والتعاون الاجتماعي وتعزيز قيمها في التربية والتعليم والممارسات الاجتماعية."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن آثار التغيب عن العمل: تحليل لتأثيرات الانقطاع على الفرد والعملية الإنتاجية","output":"يعتبر التغيب عن العمل أمرًا يؤثر بشكل سلبي على الفرد والعملية الإنتاجية. فعندما يتغيب العاملون عن العمل بشكل متكرر، يترتب على ذلك تأثيرات سلبية كبيرة على أداء الشركة والموظفين. لذا، يجب فهم أسباب وتأثيرات هذا الانقطاع، والتصدي له بإجراءات مناسبة للحفاظ على استقرار العمل وتعزيز الإنتاجية. تعتبر التأثيرات السلبية للتغيب عن العمل متعددة وتؤثر على مستويات مختلفة. أحد التأثيرات الرئيسية هو التأثير على الفرد نفسه. بشكل عام، يشعر الأفراد الذين يتغيبون بشكل متكرر بالضغط النفسي والقلق من توالي الغيابات، مما يؤثر سلبًا على صحتهم العقلية والجسدية. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يمكن أن يتسبب التغيب المستمر في فقدان الهمة والرغبة في العمل، مما يقلل من الأداء والتحفيز الشخصي للموظف. أما على صعيد الشركة، فإن التغيب المتكرر يضر بالعملية الإنتاجية والفعالية التنظيمية. فالغياب يؤدي إلى توقف العمل في بعض الأحيان أو تأخير في التسليم، مما يؤثر سلبًا على جودة الخدمات أو المنتجات المقدمة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، قد يؤدي التغيب المتكرر إلى زيادة عبء العمل على الموظفين الآخرين، مما يزيد من مستوى التوتر والإرهاق لديهم. وبالتالي، يؤدي ذلك إلى تأثير سلبي على رضا العملاء وعلى سمعة الشركة. لمعالجة هذه المشكلة، تحاول الشركات تبني سياسات وإجراءات تعزز حضور الموظفين وتقليل التغيب. يمكن تحقيق ذلك من خلال تقديم مؤتمرات تدريبية لتعزيز الوعي بأهمية الالتزام بمواعيد العمل، وتقنيات إدارة الضغط والتوتر. كما يمكن توفير بيئة عمل مشجعة وداعمة، حيث يشعر الموظفون بالقبول والتقدير. وبالطبع، يجب أيضًا العمل على تطوير نظام رصد وتقييم للحضور والغياب، مما يمكن من قياس وتتبع نمط التغيب واتخاذ التدابير اللازمة للتعامل معه. في الختام، من الواضح أنّ التغيب المتكرر عن العمل يؤثر بشكل سلبي على الفرد والعملية الإنتاجية. لذا، يجب أن يكون هناك تركيز على ضمان حضور الموظفين والتشجيع على الالتزام بمواعيدهم، بالإضافة إلى تطوير نظام فعال لمتابعة الحضور والغياب.

التي تواجه عددًا كبيرًا من البلدان حول العالم. تتسبب عمليات التصحر في تدهور الأراضي الجافة وتجفيف الموارد المياه العذبة، مما يتسبب في تؤثر على التنوع البيولوجي، الزراعة وواقتصاد البلدان المتضررة. إن آثار التصحر تعتبر تحديًا مستمرًا وتشكل تهديدًا كبيرًا على البيئة والحياة البشرية. ولذلك، يجب تبني استجابة فورية لمواجهة هذه المشكلة الخطيرة. أحد أهم تأثيرات التصحر هو تقلص الأراضي الزراعية الخصبة. يؤدي نقص الماء واستنزاف التربة إلى تدهور جودة الأراضي وقلة توافر الموارد الزراعية الضرورية. ويجعل هذا المشكلة غذائية خطيرة في البلدان المتضررة، حيث يتعرض معظم سكانها لخطر الجوع وعدم القدرة على تأمين الاحتياجات الأساسية للحياة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن تقلص الأراضي الزراعية يؤثر أيضًا على التنوع البيولوجي والنظم الإيكولوجية، حيث يتم تدمير الموائل الطبيعية وانقراض الكائنات الحية التابعة لها. وتشمل آثار التصحر أيضًا تدهور جودة الهواء وزيادة الحوادث المتعلقة بالعواصف الترابية والرمالية. عندما تجف الأراضي وتتشقق، تنشأ كميات كبيرة من الغبار والتربة العالقة في الهواء، وتؤدي إلى تلوث الهواء وتنشر الأمراض التنفسية والحساسية. كما تعرف بعض المناطق عواصف ترابية عنيفة قد تكون ضارة للحياة البشرية وتسبب أضرارًا للمباني والبنى التحتية. علاوة على ذلك، فإن ازدياد عمليات التصحر يؤدي أيضًا إلى نقص المياه العذبة. تعتبر المياه موردًا حيويًا للحياة على كوكب الأرض، ولكن التصحر يسبب تجفيف البحيرات والأنهار والينابيع العذبة. تتأثر بذلك النظم البيولوجية المائية ويتأثر تنوع الحياة البحرية والأحياء المائية. تؤثر ندرة المياه العذبة أيضًا على البشرية بشكل كبير، حيث يجد الناس صعوبة في الحصول على المياه النقية الآمنة للشرب والاستخدام اليومي. لذا، فإن التصحر يمثل واحدة من أهم التحديات البيئية التي يجب التصدي لها بشكل فوري وجاد. يجب على الحكومات والمجتمعات الدولية والأفراد أن يتعاونوا لتطبيق استراتيجيات وحلول فعالة للحد من آثار التصحر وتحقيق التنمية المستدامة. يجب تعزيز زراعة الأشجار وإدارة المياه وتحسين التقنيات الزراعية وحماية الموارد الطبيعية. يتطلب تحقيق هذه الأهداف التعاون العالمي والتزامًا قويًا باستخدام الموارد بشكل مستدام والعمل على تعزيز التوعية والتعليم بشأن خطورة التصحر. إن التصحر ليس مجرد مشكلة محلية أو إقليمية، بل هو تحدي عالمي يهدد استدامة كوكب الأرض ومستقبل البشرية. لذلك، يتعين علينا اتخاذ إجراءات جدية وفعالة للتصدي لهذه المشكلة، والعمل معًا للحفاظ على البيئة وضمان استمرارية الحياة

В данной задаче основанием можно считать отрезок BC, а высотой будет расстояние от вершины A до прямой α, которая параллельна основанию BC. Поскольку BB1 и CC1 перпендикулярны плоскости α, и BC параллельно плоскости α, то BB1 и CC1 являются высотами треугольника ABC, проведёнными к стороне BC. Так как расстояние от BC до плоскости α составляет 5 сантиметров, то длины отрезков BB1 и CC1 также равны 5 сантиметров каждый. Далее, рассмотрим прямоугольные треугольники ABB1 и ACC1, в которых известны катеты B1B и C1C (оба равны 5 см) и гипотенузы AB1 и AC1 (соответственно равны 13 см и 15 см). Чтобы найти основание BC, нам необходимо использовать теорему Пифагора для обоих прямоугольных треугольников: В треугольнике ABB1: AB^2 = AB1^2 - BB1^2 AB^2 = 13^2 - 5^2 AB^2 = 169 - 25 AB^2 = 144 AB = √144 AB = 12 см В треугольнике ACC1: AC^2 = AC1^2 - CC1^2 AC^2 = 15^2 - 5^2 AC^2 = 225 - 25 AC^2 = 200 AC = √200 AC = √(100 * 2) AC = 10√2 см Теперь у нас есть все три стороны треугольника B1C1C и треугольника B1C1B. Мы можем использовать теорему Пифагора, чтобы найти сторону BC, но проще будет применить теорему косинусов, так как нам уже известна сторона B1C1 и две прилежащие стороны к её концам в обоих треугольниках. Угол между сторонами AB1 и AC1 в треугольнике AB1C1 является тупым, поскольку в него вписывается прямой угол треугольника ACC1. Таким образом, применяем теорему косинусов для нахождения длины стороны BC: BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 * AB * AC * cos(∠BAC) Так как ∠BAC является тупым, cos(∠BAC) будет отрицательным, и мы можем записать уравнение как: BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 + 2 * AB * AC * |cos(∠BAC)| Мы не знаем угол BAC, но можем найти его косинус, используя стороны треугольника AB1C1, так как эти стороны соответственно равны сторонам B1C1, AB1 и AC1 треугольника ABC. cos(∠BAC) = (AB1^2 + AC1^2 - B1C1^2) / (2 * AB1 * AC1) cos(∠BAC) = (13^2 + 15^2 - 14^2) / (2 * 13 * 15) cos(∠BAC) = (169 + 225 - 196) / (390) cos(∠BAC) = 198 / 390 cos(∠BAC) = 99 / 195 cos(∠BAC) = 33 / 65 Теперь мы можем найти BC^2, используя значения AB, AC и косинус угла. BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 + 2 * AB * AC * |cos(∠BAC)| BC^2 = 144 + 200 + 2 * 12 * 10√2 * 33/65 BC^2 = 344 + (2 * 12 * 10√2 * 33/65) BC^2 = 344 + (7920√2 / 65) BC^2 = 344 + (396√2 / 13) BC^2 = 344 + (396 * 1.41421356237 / 13) BC^2 = 344 + (559.68109724586 / 13) BC^2 = 344 + 43.052392095065 BC^2 = 387.052392095065 BC = √387.052392095065 BC ≈ 19.675 см (округлив до трех знаков после запятой) Площадь треугольника ABC теперь можно найти, используя формулу для площади треугольника: S = (основание * высота) / 2 S = (BC * высота) / 2 S = (19.675 см * 5 см) / 2 S ≈ (98.375 см^2) / 2 S ≈ 49.1875 см^2 Площадь треугольника ABC примерно равна 49.188 см^2 (округлив до трех знаков после запятой).

alpha nabla f(mathbf{w}_{text{old}}) ] 其中，( alpha ) 是学习率，它决定了我们每一步沿梯度相反方向移动的大小。太大的学习率可能会导致我们“越过”最低点，而太小的学习率则会导致收敛速度很慢。 3. **问：为什么在计算梯度时其他变量需要保持不变？** 答：在计算偏导数时，我们关注的是函数 ( f ) 在单个变量( x_i ) 方向上的变化情况，而其他变量保持不变，以便我们能够准确衡量该变量的改变是如何独立影响函数 ( f ) 的值。这样，我们就得到了一个真实的局部变化率，而不是由其他变量引起的变化。"},{"instruction":"数学告知直接表示出来就好","output":"当然，假设我们有一个多元函数 ( f(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) )，那么这个函数相对于向量 (mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n]) 的梯度可以表示为： [ nabla f(mathbf{x}) = begin{bmatrix} frac{partial f}{partial x_1} frac{partial f}{partial x_2} vdots frac{partial f}{partial x_n} end{bmatrix} ] 这里，( nabla ) 表示梯度算子，而 ( frac{partial f}{partial x_i} ) 表示函数相对于第 ( i ) 个变量的偏导数。所以，梯度是一个由所有偏导数组成的向量，体现了函数在多个变量维度上的变化情况。"},{"instruction":"2.4.4. 链式法则 然而，上面方法可能很难找到梯度。 这是因为在深度学习中，多元函数通常是复合（composite）的， 所以难以应用上述任何规则来微分这些函数。 幸运的是，链式法则可以被用来微分复合函数。 让我们先考虑单变量函数。假设函数 和 都是可微的，根据链式法则： (2.4.10) 现在考虑一个更一般的场景，即函数具有任意数量的变量的情况。 假设可微分函数 有变量 ，其中每个可微分函数 都有变量 。 注意， 是， 的函数。 对于任意 ，链式法则给出： (2.4.11)","output":"# 主题抽取：链式法则在深度学习中的应用 链式法则是微分学中的一条基本定理，用于计算复合函数的导数。这在深度学习中尤其关键，因为神经网络常常由多个复合在一起的函数构成。 # 链式法则简述 对于单变量的情况，若有两个函数 ( u = g(x) ) 和 ( y = f(u) )，那么 ( y ) 关于 ( x ) 的导数可以由下式确定： [ frac{dy}{dx} = frac{dy}{du} cdot frac{du}{dx} ] 链式法则也适用于多元函数。假设函数 ( z = f(y_1, ldots, y_m) ) 和一系列函数 ( y_1 = g_1(x_1, ldots, x_n), ldots, y_m = g_m(x_1, ldots, x_n) )，那么 ( z ) 关于任意 ( x_i ) 的偏导数可以根据以下公式计算： [ frac{partial z}{partial x_i} = sum_{j=1}^{m} frac{partial z}{partial y_j} cdot frac{partial y_j}{partial x_i} ] 这说明了、当 ( z ) 是 ( y_j ) 的函数，同时每个 ( y_j ) 又是 ( x_i ) 的函数时，如何来计算 ( z ) 相对于 ( x_i ) 的偏导数。 # 深度学习中的链式法则解释 在深度学习中，我们通常有一个损失函数（比如交叉熵损失），它是神经网络输出和真实标签之差的函数。网络输出本身是网络各层激活函数的复合。因此，当我们需要计算损失函数关于网络参数的梯度时，我们需要沿着网络从输出回到输入应用链式法则。这在实践中通过所谓的反向传播算法完成，该算法是一种高效的链式法则应用形式。 举个例子，假设神经网络中有一个权重参数 ( w )，最后输出是 ( o )，那么损失 ( L ) 关于权重 ( w ) 的偏导数可以通过链式法则来计算： [ frac{partial L}{partial w} = frac{partial L}{partial o} cdot frac{partial o}{partial w} ] 其中，( frac{partial L}{partial o} ) 表示损失相对于输出的梯度，( frac{partial o}{partial w} ) 表示输出 ( o ) 相对于权重 ( w ) 的梯度。如果 ( o ) 本身是更多层的函数，那么我们会继续应用链式法则，直到涉及到 ( w ) 的那一层。这个过程一路向后延伸，直到覆盖到网络中所有相关的连接和激活函数，最后得到损失函数相对于所有参数的梯度。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

الاجتماعية التي تؤثر بشكل كبير على المجتمعات في مختلف أنحاء العالم. فهي تسبب آثارًا سلبية على المجتمع والفرد على السواء. يضطر الأشخاص الذين يمارسون التسول إلى طلب المال علنًا من الناس، سواء كانوا يجمعون التبرعات أو يعرضون سلعًا معينة للبيع. وبالتالي، فإن التسول يمكن أن يؤثر على المجتمع والفرد في عدة جوانب مختلفة. أما فيما يخص آثار التسول على المجتمع، فإنه يسبب تدهورًا في جودة المدن والمجتمعات. حيث يؤدي وجود المتسولين المترددين إلى إحداث فوضى في الشوارع وتشويه للمظهر العام للمدينة. كما أنها تؤدي إلى تفشي الجريمة والعنف في بعض الأحيان، نظرًا لأن بعض المتسولين يستخدمون أموالهم في شراء المواد المخدرة أو في ممارسة أنشطة غير قانونية أخرى. تتسبب ظاهرة التسول أيضًا في تدهور اقتصادي للمجتمعات المتأثرة. فعندما يتعاطى الناس مع المتسولين ويعطونهم الأموال، فإنهم يشجعون أشخاص آخرين على القيام بنفس السلوك. وعندما يزداد عدد المتسولين في المدينة، فإن الأعمال التجارية المحلية قد تتأثر سلبًا، حيث يقل عدد الزبائن وبالتالي تقل الإيرادات. وهذا من شأنه أن يؤدي إلى تدهور الاقتصاد وزيادة نسبة البطالة. وفيما يتعلق بالآثار على الفرد، فإن التسول يسبب آثارًا نفسية وصحية سلبية. فعادةً ما يكون المتسولون يعانون من ظروف صعبة، قد يكونون فقراءً أو لاجئين، وبالتالي فإنهم يعانون من ضغوط نفسية كبيرة. قد يصابون بالاكتئاب أو القلق الشديد نتيجة لحالتهم الاجتماعية الصعبة. وقد يتعرضون أيضًا للإهانة والتمييز والعنف من قبل بعض الأشخاص في المجتمع. علاوة على ذلك، يتعرض المتسولون للعديد من المخاطر الصحية والبيئية. ففي حياتهم المتردية، قد يعيشون في ظروف قاسية وغير صحية. يجدون أنفسهم في ظروف ملائمة لانتشار الأمراض والعدوى. وقد يتعرضون لخطر الإصابة بالأمراض المعدية بسبب الظروف السيئة للنوم والتغذية السيئة. بصفة عامة، يمكن القول إن آثار التسول على المجتمع والفرد هي آثار سلبية تؤثر على الجميع. ولتقليل هذه الظاهرة، يجب على الحكومات والمجتمعات المستهدفة اتخاذ إجراءات مناسبة لتوفير فرص عمل ودعم الفقراء والمحتاجين. يجب أيضًا توفير الخدمات الاجتماعية الأساسية، مثل السكن والرعاية الصحية والتعليم، لتحسين وضع المجتمع بشكل عام وخلق فرص عدالة اجتماعية للجميع."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن تأثير التدخين

الصحية الخطيرة للتدخين على الرجال والنساء معروفة جيداً، إلا أنه يجب أن نسلط الضوء على التأثيرات السلبية التي يمكن أن يكون للتدخين على صحة وجمال المرأة. أولاً وقبل كل شيء، يجب أن نشير إلى التأثيرات الصحية الخطيرة للتدخين على المرأة. فالمرأة المدخنة تكون أكثر عرضة للإصابة بالأمراض المزمنة مثل السرطان وأمراض القلب والجهاز التنفسي بالمقارنة مع غيرها من النساء. وتظهر الدراسات أن التدخين يزيد من خطر الإصابة بالسرطانات النسائية المختلفة، مثل سرطان الثدي وسرطان عنق الرحم وسرطان المبيض. كما يعرض التدخين المرأة لخطر الإصابة بأمراض الرئة، مثل الالتهاب الرئوي والتهاب القصبات الهوائية المزمنة. هناك أيضًا تأثيرات سلبية للتدخين على جمال المرأة. فعندما تدخن المرأة، تؤثر المواد الكيميائية السامة الموجودة في التبغ على البشرة وتؤدي إلى تدهور في مظهرها. يتسبب التدخين في تلف الكولاجين والإيلاستين، وهما المكونان الأساسيان لشباب ومرونة البشرة. وعندما يتم تدمير الكولاجين والإيلاستين، يظهر التجاعيد والخطوط الدقيقة على الجلد، ويفقد البشرة مظهرها الصحي والشاب. هذا بالإضافة إلى زيادة احتمال حدوث آثار تصبغ الجلد وبقع الشمس. ومن الآثار الأخرى التي لها تأثير سلبي على جمال المرأة، تذكر تغير لون الأسنان وتصبغها باللون الأصفر وتدهور النكهة والرائحة بالفم. كما تزداد احتمالات إصابة المدخنة بمشاكل الشعر والأظافر، حيث تصبح الشعرة أقل لمعاناً وتتكسر الأظافر بسرعة أكبر. إضافةً إلى ذلك، يجب أن نشير إلى أن المرأة المدخنة قد تخاطر بالإضرار بصحة الأجنة وتكون أكثر عرضة للإجهاض أو الولادة المبكرة أو ولادة الأطفال ذوي الوزن المنخفض. فالتدخين خلال فترة الحمل يؤثر على تدفق الدم والأكسجين إلى الجنين ويؤدي إلى ولادة غير صحية. بناءً على ما سبق، يُظهر أن التدخين له تأثيرات صحية خطيرة وتأثيرات جمالية سلبية كبيرة على المرأة. ينصح بشدة النساء بالامتناع عن التدخين للحفاظ على صحتهن العامة وجمالهن الخارجي، فالابتعاد عن هذه العادة الضارة سيساهم في تحسين نوعية الحياة وآفاق الجمال للمرأة."},{"instruction":"اكتب

على استعداد للتعامل مع وجهات النظر المختلفة والتفاوض والتوصل إلى حلول مشتركة. وبهذا يتم بناء جسور التواصل والتفاهم بين الأفراد والمجتمعات المختلفة. 2- تحقيق السلام الاجتماعي: يعد التسامح عنصرًا أساسيًا في ترسيخ السلام الاجتماعي. حيث يؤدي القبول والاحترام المتبادل بين الأفراد إلى تقليل الصراعات والتوترات التي قد تنشأ بين جماعات مختلفة. وبدلاً من ذلك، يتم تعزيز التعايش السلمي والتفاهم المشترك لبناء مجتمعٍ متناغم ومزدهر. 3- التنمية المجتمعية: يسهم التسامح في توفير بيئة إيجابية للتنمية المجتمعية. حيث يشجع التسامح التعاون بين الأفراد بغض النظر عن خلفياتهم وتفاصيلهم الشخصية. هذا التعاون البناء يعزز الفكر الإبداعي ويسهم في تقديم حلول مبتكرة للمشاكل التي تواجه المجتمعات المتعددة الثقافات. 4- تعزيز التعددية الثقافية: يعد التسامح أساسًا للتعايش السلمي بين الثقافات المختلفة. فعندما يُظهِر الأفراد والمجتمعات احترامًا للتنوع الثقافي ويتعايشون بسلام، فإنهم يساهمون في تعزيز الحوار الثقافي وفهم أعمق للثقافات الأخرى. 5- النمو الاقتصادي: يُعتَبَر التسامح محركًا للنمو الاقتصادي في المجتمعات. فعندما يكون هناك تعاون وتفاهم واحترام بين الأفراد، فإنه يُشجع على الاستثمار والتجارة، وبذلك تنشأ فرص العمل وتتحسن الحياة الاقتصادية للمجتمع بأكمله. عندما يصبح التسامح جزءًا من قيم المجتمع، فإنه يساهم في بناء جسور التفاهم وتعزيز السلام الاجتماعي. يتم تعزيز التعاون بين الأفراد وتغذية التفاهم، مما يعزز التنمية المجتمعية والثقافية والاقتصادية. لذا، يجب أن نعمل جميعًا على تعزيز قيمة التسامح في حياتنا اليومية وفيما بيننا، لنخلق مجتمعًا يسوده السلام والازدهار."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن تأثير التدخين على المجتمع: بين الصحة العامة والتكاليف الاقتصادية","output":"لطالما اعتبر التدخين من المشاكل الصحية الخطيرة التي تؤثر على المجتمعات بشكل كبير. إن التدخين له آثار سلبية على الصحة العامة ويترتب عليه تكاليف اقتصادية هائلة. يجب أن ندرك جميعًا التأثير الضار الذي يتركه التدخين على المجتمعات ونتحرك نحو الحد من هذه المشكلة. تأثير التدخين على الصحة العامة ليس محدودًا فقط على المدخنين أنفسهم، بل يمتد للأشخاص الذين يعيشون في محيطهم. في الواقع، يحتوي الدخان على مئات المواد الكيميائية الضارة التي يتم استنشاقها من قِبَل المدخن والجميع من حوله. تثبت الأبحاث أن التعرض المزمن للدخان يرتبط بالعديد من المشاكل الصحية مثل أمراض القلب والأوعية الدموية وأمراض الجهاز التنفسي، بما في ذلك السرطان. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن النساء الحوامل المدخنات قد يتأثر أطفالهن بمشاكل صحية أكثر خطورة، مثل الإمكانات التنموية المعوقة والتشوهات الخلقية. من ضمن التأثيرات الأخرى للتدخين على المجتمعات هي التكاليف الاقتصادية الهائلة التي تترتب على علاج المشاكل الصحية التي يسببها التدخين. يعد العلاج ديناميكية مرتفعة، وتكاليف الرعاية الصحية والأدوية تضيف عبئًا كبيرًا على المجتمع والنظام الصحي. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يؤدي التدخين أيضًا إلى زيادة الغياب عن العمل بسبب المرض، وبالتالي تدهور الإنتاجية والتأثير على الاقتصاد. لمحاربة تأثير التدخين على المجتمع، يجب اتخاذ إجراءات قوية وشاملة. ينبغي تعزيز الوعي والتثقيف للأفراد بخطورة التدخين وتبعاته، والتركيز على التدخل المبكر والمساعدة في الإقلاع عن التدخين. يجب أيضًا فرض سياسات حازمة للتحكم في التدخين، مثل محظر التدخين في الأماكن العامة وزيادة الضرائب على منتجات التبغ. علاوة على ذلك، ينبغي أن يكون هناك تعاون بين الحكومات والمؤسسات الصحية والمجتمع المدني لتوفير الدعم اللازم للأفراد الذين يحاولون الإقلاع عن التدخين. يمكن توفير برامج المساعدة والعلاجات البديلة للتخفيف من الاعتماد على التبغ. في النهاية، يجب أن نتعامل بجدية مع مشكلة التدخين وتأثيرها على المجتمع. يعد التدخين مشكلة صحية حقيقية تؤثر على الصحة العامة وتكاليف الرعاية الصحية والاقتصاد. ينبغي علينا جميعًا العمل معًا لخفض نسبة التدخين وتشجيع الصحة والعافية في مجتمعاتنا."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن آثار التسامح على الفرد والمجتمع: بناء جسور الفهم وتعزيز التنمية المستدامة","output":"تعدّ آثار التسامح على الفرد والمجتمع أمرًا بالغ الأهمية في بناء مجتمع يعيش في سلام واستقرار. فالتسامح هو القدرة على قبول التنوع والاحترام المتبادل بين الأفراد والثقافات المختلفة. يعتبر التسامح أساسًا لبناء جسور الفهم بين الناس وتعزيز التنمية المستدامة. أحد الآثار الإيجابية للتسامح على الفرد هو تعزيز الانفتاح والتعايش في المجتمع. عندما يتسامح الفرد، يكون مستعدًا للاحتكاك بتفكير وأفكار مختلفة، مما يوسّع آفاقه العقلية ويزيد من وعيه. يتعلم الفرد أن يكون مرنًا ومستعدًا لتغيير وجهات نظره، مما يؤثر إيجابيًا على نموه الشخصي والمهني. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يساهم التسامح في تعزيز التنمية المستدامة في المجتمع. عندما يتعايش الناس بسلام واحترام، يتكون بيئة مواتية للتعاون والتطور. يتمكن الأفراد من التعاون معًا للبحث عن حلول للمشاكل المشتركة وتحقيق التقدم. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يشجع التسامح على المشاركة الفعّالة للجميع في اتخاذ القرارات والمشاركة في عملية التنمية، مما يؤدي إلى تحقيق توازن أفضل بين المصالح الفردية والمصالح الجماعية. علاوة على ذلك، يعزز التسامح روح الانتماء للمجتمع ويقلل من التوترات الاجتماعية. عندما يشعر الناس بأنهم مقبولون ومحترمون من قبل المجتمع، فإنهم يشعرون بالراحة والأمان. هذا بدوره يؤدي إلى تقليل الصراعات والاحتكاكات بين الأفراد ويعزز العلاقات الإيجابية. وبالتالي، يمكن للتسامح أن يلعب دورًا هامًا في خلق بيئة سلمية ومترابطة. وفي النهاية، يمكننا القول إنّ آثار التسامح على الفرد والمجتمع لا تقتصر على الجوانب الاجتماعية فحسب، بل تمتد إلى الجوانب الاقتصادية والسياسية والثقافية. من خلال التسامح، يمكن للمجتمع تحقيق التوازن الشامل والاستدامة في تنميته وتقدمه. لذا، يجب أن نعمل جميعًا على تعزيز روح التسامح والاحترام المتبادل، وبناء جسور الفهم للمجتمعات المتعددة الثقافات، لتحقيق عالم أفضل

ملحوظ. فالبنج النصفي هو نوع من الأدوية المخصصة لتخفيف الألم وتمنح الشخص الاسترخاء خلال الإجراءات الجراحية أو العلاجات الطبية الأخرى. سنقوم في هذا المقال بتحليل تأثيراته على الجسم والعقل، بالإضافة إلى السبل التي يمكن أن يتم بها تخفيف تأثيراته الجانبية. بالنسبة للتأثيرات على الجسم، يقوم البنج النصفي بتهدئة الجهاز العصبي المركزي، مما يؤدي إلى تخفيف الألم وتهدئة العضلات. هذا يساهم في إجراء العمليات الجراحية بسهولة ويجعل الجسم يتعافى بشكل أسرع بعد العملية. ولكن يجب أن نلاحظ أنه قد تظهر بعض التأثيرات الجانبية، مثل الغثيان والقيء والدوار والصداع. علاوة على ذلك، يمكن أن يكون للبنج النصفي تأثير مهدئ على الجهاز التنفسي، وقد يحتاج البعض إلى مراقبة إضافية أثناء استخدامه. فيما يتعلق بالتأثيرات على العقل، يمكن أن يسبب البنج النصفي التأثيرات النفسية مثل الارتباك والعصبية والقلق. هذه التأثيرات الجانبية يمكن أن تكون طارئة ومؤقتة، وعادة ما تتلاشى بعد استخدام الدواء. ومع ذلك، يجب على الأشخاص الذين يعانون من حالات صحية نفسية معينة، مثل الاكتئاب أو القلق المزمن، استشارة الطبيب قبل استخدام البنج النصفي. هناك سبل تخفيف تأثيرات البنج النصفي الجانبية. أولاً، يجب تجنب استخدام الجرعات الزائدة أو استخدامه لفترة زمنية طويلة. يجب أن يتم وصف الجرعة الصحيحة من قبل الطبيب واتباع التعليمات بعناية. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، ينصح الأطباء بأخذ الدواء قبل العملية فقط عند الضرورة القصوى، وتجنب تناوله في حالة عدم الحاجة إليه. كما ينبغي للأشخاص الذين يعانون من حالات صحية معينة أن يستشيروا الطبيب المعالج لاستشارته حول سلامة استخدام البنج النصفي. تحليل آثار البنج النصفي يعد أمرًا هامًا لضمان استخدامه بأمان وفائدة. بالرغم من أنه يمكن أن يقدم تخفيفًا فعّالًا للألم ويسهل العمليات الجراحية، إلا أنه يترتب عليه بعض التأثيرات الجانبية التي يجب مراعاتها والتعامل معها بحذر. يجب الالتزام بالجرعات المحددة، والاستشارة مع الأطباء المختصين، واتباع الإرشادات النصية لضمان السلامة الشخصية والصحية."},{"instruction":"اكتب

خلال تتبع الأخبار الوطنية والتعرف على ما يجري في البلد، يتم تشكيل تجارب الأفراد وتأثيرهم النفسي والاجتماعي. إن تكونات الحياة اليومية تتأثر بشكل كبير بالأحداث الوطنية، سواء كانت إيجابية أو سلبية. في البداية، تؤثر الأحداث الوطنية على مشاعر الأفراد وتجاربهم النفسية. على سبيل المثال، عند حدوث أحداث سعيدة مثل الفوز ببطولة رياضية أو تحقيق انتصار عسكري، يشعر الأفراد بالفخر والسعادة وتزيد انتمائهم لبلدهم. يتطور الشعور بالهوية الوطنية وينعكس ذلك في تجاربهم اليومية، حيث يظهر الأفراد تفاعلًا إيجابيًا مع المجتمع وينجحون في بناء علاقات اجتماعية متينة. من ناحية أخرى، تؤثر الأحداث الوطنية السلبية أيضًا على تجارب الأفراد وحياتهم. تعيش البلاد أحيانًا تحت ضغوط سياسية أو اقتصادية أو اجتماعية، وتنعكس هذه الضغوط على المتضررين الأكثر هشاشة في المجتمع. يمكن أن يعاني الأفراد من التوتر والقلق والاكتئاب نتيجة للأحداث السلبية، مثل الحروب أو الكوارث الطبيعية أو الأزمات الاقتصادية. يعاني الناس من فقدان الوظائف والدخل والأمان، مما قد يؤدي إلى تدهور الظروف المعيشية والأوضاع الاجتماعية. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تؤثر الأحداث الوطنية على تجربة الأفراد في المجتمع عن طريق توجيههم نحو التغيير والمشاركة المجتمعية. يمكن أن تشجع الأحداث الوطنية الإيجابية الأفراد على المساهمة في المجتمع ومحاولة تحقيق التغيير. يتم تعزيز التحفيز للعمل التطوعي وللعمل الجماعي، مما يشجع على بناء تجربة مفيدة وقيمة. من الواضح أن الأحداث الوطنية تؤثر بشكل كبير على حياة الأفراد في المجتمع. يجب على الأفراد أن يفهموا أهمية متابعة الأخبار الوطنية وفهم تأثيرها على حياتهم، وكذلك التفاعل مع هذه الأحداث بشكل مناسب. لا بد للأفراد من أن يبقوا على اتصال ببلدهم وأن يكونوا واعين للتغيرات التي يشهدها المجتمع وأن يتعاونوا في بناء مستقبل أفضل

وتحدياتهم في بناء مستقبل مستدام تعد البطالة من أبرز التحديات التي يواجهها الشباب في العصر الحديث. إن البطالة تؤثر بشكل سلبي على تجربة الشباب وتحكم في مستقبلهم المهني والاقتصادي. تواجه البطالة الشباب بتحديات كبيرة للتأقلم مع الظروف الاقتصادية الصعبة وبناء مستقبل مستدام. أثر البطالة على الشباب يتجلى أولاً في الجانب النفسي والعاطفي. يعاني الشباب من الشعور بالاحباط واليأس بسبب عدم القدرة على العثور على وظيفة مناسبة. قد يصابون بالقلق والضغط النفسي بسبب عدم الأمان المالي والاستقرار الوظيفي. يمكن أن تنعكس هذه المشاعر السلبية على حياتهم الشخصية وعلاقاتهم المهنية والاجتماعية. وبالإضافة إلى الآثار النفسية، يعاني الشباب من الصعوبات المالية بسبب البطالة. قد يجدون صعوبة في تحمل تكاليف المعيشة الأساسية وسد احتياجاتهم اليومية. يتعرضون للتراكمات الديون وقد يفقدون القدرة على تحقيق أهدافهم المالية الطويلة الأمد. يمكن أن تؤثر صعوبات المالية المستمرة على الصحة العامة والرفاهية الشخصية للشباب. علاوة على ذلك، يعمل البطالة على تقييد قدرات الشباب وفرصهم في التطوير المهني والنمو المستدام. يعتبر الشباب هم أساس المجتمع والقوة الدافعة للتغيير والابتكار. إلا أن البطالة تمنع الشباب من تطوير مهاراتهم وبناء تجربة عملية قوية. يمكن أن يتسبب ضيق الفرص ونقص الخبرات في تراجع فرص الشباب في سوق العمل وتقليل فرص الترقية المهنية في المستقبل. لمواجهة هذه التحديات، تحتاج الشباب إلى الدعم والتمكين من قبل المجتمع والحكومة والمؤسسات التعليمية والاقتصادية. يجب أن يتم توفير برامج دعم وتدريب للشباب لتحسين مهاراتهم وزيادة فرصهم في الحصول على وظائف ذات رواتب جيدة. يجب أيضًا تشجيع ريادة الأعمال ودعم الشباب لبناء مشاريعهم الخاصة وتطوير استراتيجيات مبتكرة للعمل. قد تكون البطالة تحدٍ كبيرًا للشباب، ولكن يمكن تجاوزها إذا تم توفير البنية التحتية اللازمة والفرص المناسبة. يجب أن يعمل المجتمع بأكمله على دعم الشباب في بناء مستقبل مستدام يعكس طموحاتهم ويساهم في تطور المجتمع. من خلال توفير فرص العمل الكافية والتعليم المهني والدعم المالي، يمكن تجاوز آثار البطالة وتحقيق نمو مستدام ورفاهية للشباب والمجتمع بأسره."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن تأملات في الحياة الحديثة: آثار البعد عن الله وكيفية تأثيرها على النفس والمجتمع","output":"تأملات في الحياة الحديثة: آثار البعد عن الله وكيفية تأثيرها على النفس والمجتمع تعيش البشرية اليوم في عصر حديث يتميز بتطور التكنولوجيا والتقدم العلمي، حيث أصبحت الحياة سهلة ومريحة بفضل اكتشافات العصر الحديث. ومع ذلك، فإن هذا النمط الحديث من الحياة يعاني من بعض التحديات والمشكلات التي يجب على المجتمع مواجهتها. أحد أكبر التحديات في هذا العصر هو البعد عن الله ونقص التواصل معه. لقد أصبح الله مجرد كائن خيالي في حياة الكثيرين، والنتيجة الطبيعية لذلك هي فقدان التوجه الروحي في الحياة وانحراف النفوس عن القيم الأخلاقية والروحية. يعاني الأفراد بشكل خاص من هذا البعد عن الله، إذ أصبحت الحياة مجرد سباق دائم ومستمر لتحقيق النجاح والتفوق. يقضي الناس الكثير من الوقت في العمل والتكنولوجيا، ويتجاهلون جانب الروحانية والتواصل مع الله. هذا الانغماس الدائم في العمل الشاق يؤدي إلى تفريغ النفس وإحساس بالإرهاق الدائم، وتراجع الراحة النفسية. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يصبح الفرد عرضة للتوتر والقلق الزائد، لأنه فقد الراحة الروحية التي توفرها القرب من الله. بالإضافة إلى تأثيرها على النفس، يؤثر هذا البعد عن الله أيضًا على المجتمع بشكل عام. تزداد حالات العنف والغضب والتوتر في المجتمعات الحديثة، حيث يشعر الناس بالاغتراب والتبعية عندما يفقدون الاتصال بالله ويتجاهلون القيم الروحية. يقود هذا إلى ضعف الترابط الاجتماعي وتدهور العلاقات العائلية والاجتماعية، مما يؤثر سلباً على الأمن النفسي للأفراد والمجتمع بأكمله. ولكن، هل يمكن تجاوز هذا البعد واستعادة الاتصال مع الله؟ الإجابة ببساطة هي نعم. يجب على الأفراد أن ينظروا أكثر في داخل أنفسهم ويبحثوا عن الروحانية والقرب من الله. من خلال العبادة والصلاة والتأمل، يمكن للأفراد أن يستعيدوا هذا الاتصال الضائع. يجب على المجتمعات أيضًا أن تعمل على إعادة بناء القيم الروحية في الحياة اليومية وتعزيز التواصل مع الله من خلال توفير الفرص والمساحات المناسبة لذلك. بالاعتماد على التواصل مع الله، يمكن للأفراد والمجتمعات أن يتجاوزوا هذا البعد الضار عن الله ويبدأوا في تحقيق الراحة النفسية والسلام الروحي الذين فقدوهما. يجب أن يكون التواصل مع الله والاقتراب منه هدفًا أساسيًا في حياة الفرد والمجتمع، لأنه الوسيلة الوحيدة التي يمكن أن تشعر النفوس بالسكينة والسعادة الحقيقية في هذا العالم المضطرب والمتلاشي."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن الآثار الاقتصادية والاجتماعية للبطالة المقنعة: تحليل لتداول الأفراد خارج سوق العمل","output":"البطالة هي مشكلة اقتصادية واجتماعية خطيرة تؤثر على الأفراد والمجتمعات بشكل كبير. ولكن هناك نوع آخر من البطالة يعرف بالبطالة المقنعة، والتي تتطلب تحليلًا فريدًا لتداول الأفراد خارج سوق العمل. عندما نتحدث عن البطالة المقنعة، نعني الأفراد الذين يكونون خارج سوق العمل رغم أنهم لا يحصلون على دخل ولا يعملون بمهنة تناسب مؤهلاتهم وقدراتهم. هؤلاء الأفراد قد يعملون في وظائف غير مرغوب فيها ودون إمكانية الارتقاء في الحياة المهنية، أو يكونون يبحثون عن وظائف طويلة الأجل ولا يتوفر لديهم فرص عمل قارة. أحد الآثار الاقتصادية الملحوظة للبطالة المقنعة هو تأثيرها السلبي على النمو الاقتصادي. إذا كانت هناك نسبة عالية من العمال المقنعين، فإن هناك فائضاً من القوى العاملة غير المستغلة، مما يؤدي إلى تباطؤ النمو الاقتصادي وتزييف سوق العمل. الأشخاص المقنعون يعانون أيضًا من نقص الدخل والثروة، مما يقلل من الإنفاق الاستهلاكي والاستثمار، الأمر الذي يقوض أيضا النمو الاقتصادي ويؤثر على الأعمال والشركات المحلية. على صعيد المجتمع، تواجه البطالة المقنعة تحديات اجتماعية خطيرة. يكون للأفراد المقنعين تأثير سلبي على مستوى المعيشة والرفاهية، وقد تؤدي إلى العزلة الاجتماعية والتعرض للفقر والظروف السكنية الرديئة. تكون للبطالة المقنعة تأثيرًا نفسيًا كبيرًا أيضًا، حيث قد يعاني الأفراد من القلق والاكتئاب وانخفاض التقدير الذاتي بسبب عدم القدرة على تحقيق طموحاتهم المهنية وتوفير مستقبل مستقر لأنفسهم وأسرهم. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تؤثر البطالة المقنعة بشكل كبير على الثقة بين الفئات المختلفة في المجتمع. قد ينشأ توتر اجتماعي بين الأفراد المقنعين والعاملين وبين الفئات الاجتماعية المختلفة، مما يزيد من التفاوت الاجتماعي والعداء بين الأفراد. للتغلب على البطالة المقنعة، يجب تبني استراتيجيات وسياسات فعالة لتحفيز النمو الاقتصادي وتوفير فرص عمل تناسب مهارات العمال المقنعين. يجب أن تتضمن هذه الاستراتيجيات التعليم والتدريب المهني وتشجيع الاستثمار في القطاعات المحلية وتنمية الأعمال الصغيرة والمتوسطة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يجب أن يلتزم المجتمع بتقديم الدعم الاجتماعي والنفسي للأفراد المقنعين، بما في ذلك توفير فرص التدريب والمشاركة في الأنشطة المجتمعية، وتعزيز الاستقلالية المالية من خلال البرامج الحكومية والمؤسسات المختلفة. باختصار، يعد البطالة المقنعة تحديًا مهمًا يجب أن يتعامل معه المجتمع بجدية. يجب على الحكومات والمؤسسات والمجتمعات العمل سويًا لتعزيز النمو الاقتصادي وتوفير فرص عمل للأفراد المقنعين، لأن ذلك هو المفتاح لتعزيز التنمية الشاملة وبناء مجتمع عادل

لها تأثيرات عميقة ومتعددة الجوانب على البيئة والمجتمعات. تأثيرات البراكين على البيئة: تعتبر البراكين من أهم المصادر لإطلاق الغازات والزبد الحارق الذي يسبب التلوث الجوي. فتجب على البراكين أن تطلق ما يقرب من 200 مليون طن من غازي ثاني أكسيد الكربون والثاني أكسيد الكبريت سنويًا. وهذا له تأثير سلبي على جودة الهواء وصحة الأشخاص القاطنين في المناطق المجاورة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تسبب البراكين في الحرائق الغابات، وتدمير المزروعات والحقول الزراعية المجاورة. كما تعيق البراكين عملية التربية والحياة البرية. والبيئات البحرية لا تسلم من هذا الآثار السلبية، حيث يتسرب الحمم البركانية إلى المحيطات والبحار، مما يؤثر على الحياة البحرية والشعاب المرجانية القريبة. تأثيرات البراكين على المجتمعات: تتسبب البراكين في تدمير الممتلكات وتشريد المئات من الأشخاص المقيمين في المناطق القريبة. وقد تؤدي إلى خسائر فادحة في الحياة البشرية وتسبب كوارث طبيعية. على سبيل المثال، في عام 2019، ثار بركان وايت أيلاند في نيوزيلندا، مما تسبب في مقتل وإصابة العديد من الأشخاص الذين كانوا يزورون الجزيرة. وفي بعض الحالات، يمكن أن يتسبب ثوران البراكين في انقطاع التيار الكهربائي وانقطاع التنقلات والنقل. ومن الصعب تقدير تكلفة إعادة بناء المناطق المنكوبة بسبب البراكين، وذلك لأن التدمير عادة ما يكون شاملاً ومدمراً. ومع ذلك، يمكن أن تتحول آثار البراكين إلى فرص للمجتمعات المتضررة. فبعد التلاعب بتكنولوجيا الألياف الحرارية، يمكن استخدام الحجارة البركانية في بناء المنازل والمباني الأخرى. كما يمكن استخدام الحمم البركانية لتحسين نوعية التربة الزراعية وتحسين الإنتاج الزراعي. وفي النهاية، فإن الدراسات المتعمقة لآثار البراكين ضرورية لفهم ظاهرة البراكين وتأثيراتها على البيئة والمجتمعات. يجب أن تتواصل الأبحاث العلمية لتعزيز استدامة البيئة وتحسين الاستعداد لمواجهة الكوارث الناجمة عن البراكين. وعلى المستوى الشخصي، يلزمنا جميعًا أن نكون على دراية بأثرنا على البيئة وأن نعمل للحد من الانبعاثات الضارة، لنمنع تفاقم هذه الظاهرة الطبيعية

المفرط في حياة الآخرين على الصحة النفسية والعلاقات الشخصية","output":"الاهتمام بالآخرين والعناية بهم مهمان لبناء علاقات صحية وإيجابية. إلا أن الاهتمام الزائد بالآخرين والانخراط المفرط في حياتهم قد يؤثر سلبًا على الصحة النفسية والعلاقات الشخصية الخاصة بنا. قد يكون من الصعب علينا تحديد الحدود المناسبة للعناية بالآخرين والاهتمام بهم. قد ينشغل بعض الأشخاص عن أنفسهم وينسون تلبية احتياجاتهم الشخصية أو رعاية صحتهم النفسية. إذا كانت لدينا رغبة طويلة في مساعدة الآخرين وتلبية احتياجاتهم، فقد نجد أنفسنا في وضع يشبه الإنفاق الزائد على الحساب البنكي العاطل. يأخذنا اهتمامنا بالآخرين إلى حيث نشعر بالإجهاد والإرهاق، وقد لا نستطيع تلبية حاجاتنا الشخصية. العناية المفرطة بالآخرين قد تتسبب في الشعور بالضيق والرهاب الاجتماعي. عندما نركز بشكل زائد على احتياجات الآخرين، نميل إلى إغفال احتياجاتنا الشخصية وتفضيلاتنا الخاصة. قد ندفع أنفسنا لأخذ قرارات تراعي مصلحة الآخرين فقط وتضر بمصالحنا الخاصة. يُمكن أن يؤدي ذلك إلى شعور بالاستغناء عن الذات والعجز عن أخذ القرارات الخاصة بنا. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، قد يؤثر الانخراط المفرط في حياة الآخرين على العلاقات الشخصية لدينا. عندما نضحي بوقتنا وطاقتنا لصالح الآخرين، قد نشعر بالانزعاج والإحباط عندما لا يتم استدعاء جهودنا بالقدر المطلوب أو عندما لا يُقدر تضحياتنا. قد يؤدي ذلك إلى تفكك العلاقات الشخصية ونقص الدعم الاجتماعي اللازم. للحفاظ على صحتنا النفسية والعلاقات الشخصية الصحية، يجب أن نضع حدودا واضحة للاهتمام بالآخرين. يجب علينا أن نتذكر أن العناية بأنفسنا هي أيضا مهمة. من الجيد أن نساعد الآخرين ونكون لهم بالقرب، ولكن يجب أن نتأكد من أننا نعطي أولوية لاحتياجاتنا الشخصية ونعتني بصحتنا النفسية. يمكن أن تتضمن هذه الاهتمام بالنشاطات التي تجلب لنا المتعة والاسترخاء والتحدث مع إحدى الأشخاص المقربين لنا عن مشكلاتنا وأفراحنا. قد يكون الاهتمام بالآخرين أمرًا جميلًا ومهمًا لبناء العلاقات الاجتماعية، ولكن يجب أن نتذكر أن رعاية الذات لا تقل أهمية. يجب أن نجد التوازن المناسب بين الاهتمام بالآخرين والاهتمام بأنفسنا للحفاظ على صحتنا النفسية والعلاقات الشخصية الجيدة."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن إشراقة الابتسامة: دراسة للآثار الإيجابية على الصحة

النفسية والعلاقات الاجتماعية. فعندما نبتسم بصدق، تُشعر الأشخاص الآخرين بالراحة والسرور، وهذا يؤثر بدوره على صحتنا النفسية وعلاقاتنا الشخصية بشكل إيجابي. لقد أظهرت الدراسات العلمية على نطاق واسع أن الابتسامة تساهم في تحسين الصحة النفسية للفرد. عندما نبتسم، تنتج المخ وتفرز العديد من المركبات الكيميائية الإيجابية مثل الإندورفين والسيروتونين والدوبامين. هذه المركبات تعمل على تحسين المزاج وتخفيف القلق والتوتر، مما يساهم في تعزيز الرفاهية العامة والشعور بالسعادة والسكينة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، الابتسامة تؤثر بشكل كبير على العلاقات الاجتماعية. عندما نبتسم، نُشعر الآخرين بالاستقبال والترحيب، ويصبح من السهل عليهم الاقتراب منا والتفاعل معنا. تعتبر الابتسامة علامة للعبور الاجتماعي فتسهم في بناء الثقة وتعزيز العلاقات الشخصية. فعندما نبتسم، يشعر الآخرون بأننا مهتمون بهم ونود التواصل معهم، وهذا يفتح الأبواب للتفاهم والتعاون والتواصل الفعال. وبصفة عامة، الابتسامة تعكس الإيجابية والتفاؤل في الحياة، وهذا يجذب الناس نحونا. فالأشخاص الذين يسعدون ويبتسمون بشكل مستمر يبدون أكثر جاذبية وتأثيراً. وعندما يعرف الآخرون أننا نبتسم بشكل دائم، يكونون على استعداد للاقتراب منا واستشارتنا في مواقفهم الصعبة أو مشاركة أحاديثهم الشخصية. إشراقة الابتسامة ليست مجرد تصرف سطحي أو ابتسامة مُزيَّفة، بل هي تعبير صادق عن السعادة والتواصل الإيجابي. فعندما نضحك ونبتسم، نشعر بالسعادة وهذا ينعكس على الجميع من حولنا. لذلك، يجب علينا أن نهتم بالابتسامة ونبتسم بشكل مستمر، حتى في الأوقات الصعبة. ففي النهاية، الابتسامة هي

مؤثر: دراسة عن آثار الإفلاس على التجار وتأثيره على الأطراف الأخرى في السوق","output":"تداول مؤثر: دراسة عن آثار الإفلاس على التجار وتأثيره على الأطراف الأخرى في السوق يعتبر الإفلاس أحد الأحداث الأكثر تأثيرًا في عالم الأعمال، حيث ينتج عنه آثار سلبية كبيرة على التجار وأطراف أخرى عديدة في السوق. يشير مصطلح \\"تداول مؤثر\\" إلى تأثير الإفلاس على مختلف الأطراف المعنية، سواء كانوا التجار الفاشلين أو الشركات التي يدينون لها أو المستهلكين أو حتى الاقتصاد العام. أحد التأثيرات الأساسية للإفلاس على التجار هو فقدانهم لمصادر الدخل وسيلة العيش. عندما يقع التاجر في حالة إفلاس، فإنه لم يعد قادرًا على سداد ديونه أو الحفاظ على مستوى أعماله. يصبح عليه إغلاق متجره وتصفية المخزون، وعادة ما يتم بيع الأصول لسداد أي ديون متبقية. يؤدي ذلك إلى فقدان التاجر لممتلكاته ويمكن أن يكون له تأثير كبير على حياته الشخصية ومستقبله المهني. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يتأثر التجار الفاشلون بشكل كبير بالتبعات القانونية والقضائية للإفلاس. فعند تقديم طلب إفلاس، يتم فتح العديد من الإجراءات القانونية والتنظيمية المعقدة التي قد تستغرق وقتًا طويلاً وتكلفة مالية عالية. قد يدفع ذلك التاجر لتكبد تكاليف قانونية إضافية لاستعادة جزء صغير من الأموال المفقودة. يتعين عليهم أيضًا مواجهة التحقيقات والتدقيقات في المالية والحسابات الشخصية والأعمال التجارية، مما يزيد من التوتر ويتسبب في تعقيد الموقف. تأثير الإفلاس لا يقتصر فقط على التجار أنفسهم، لكنه يمتد أيضًا للأطراف الأخرى في السوق. على سبيل المثال، عندما يفشل التاجر في سداد ديونه للموردين والبنوك، قد يصعب على تلك الأطراف تلبية التزاماتهم المالية الأخرى. قد يؤدي هذا إلى حدوث ردود فعل سلبية في سلسلة التوريد، حيث قد يتأجل تسليم السلع وتوقف التعاملات التجارية. قد يؤثر الإفلاس أيضًا على السوق المحلية والاقتصاد بشكل عام، حيث قد يتراجع الطلب وتتأثر الوظائف والاستثمارات المحلية. لحسن الحظ، هناك إجراءات وأنظمة في معظم البلدان تهدف إلى مساعدة التجار المفلسين وتقليل تأثير الإفلاس على الأطراف الأخرى. تشمل هذه الإجراءات التسهيلات المالية وخطط إعادة التمويل وبرامج التدريب ودعم رأس المال البشري. تهدف هذه الجهود إلى تعزيز المرونة في السوق وتخفيف الضغوط المالية على التجّار والأطراف الأخرى المعنية. في الختام، يمكن القول إن الإفلاس له تأثير كبير على التجار وأطراف أخرى في السوق. يشكل تداول مؤثر للإفلاس تحديًا كبيرًا للأفراد والشركات المعنية، ويمكن أن يعقده الآثار الاقتصادية السلبية. لذا، فمن الضروري وضع إجراءات وأنظمة فعالة للتعامل مع هذا الواقع ومنح الدعم اللازم للمتضررين وإعادة هيكلة السوق بشكل أكثر استقرارًا وعدالة."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن تأثير الإيمان بالغيب

يتوقف الإنتاج والخدمات، مما يؤدي إلى توقف تدفق السلع والخدمات إلى السوق. تقلص الإنتاج والإيرادات يمكن أن يؤدي إلى تباطؤ النمو الاقتصادي وزيادة معدلات البطالة. قد يؤدي الإضراب إلى اضطرابات في سلاسل الإمداد والتوريد، وقد تتأثر الشركات الأخرى التي تعتمد على المواد الخام أو الخدمات المتأثرة بالإضراب بشكل سلبي أيضًا، ويمكن أن يؤدي ذلك إلى خسائر مالية كبيرة. ومن المهم أيضًا النظر في تأثير الإضرابات على المجتمع. قد يؤدي هذا التوقف إلى اضطرابات اجتماعية وتوترات بين العمال وأصحاب العمل، وقد يعاني الناس من زيادة الأسعار ونقص المواد الأساسية أثناء فترة الإضراب. يمكن أن يؤدي هذا إلى التوترات والاحتجاجات العنيفة التي قد تؤثر على أمن واستقرار المجتمع. قد تتأثر أيضًا الخدمات العامة مثل المدارس والمستشفيات ووسائل النقل العامة، مما يزيد من معاناة الناس ويؤثر على حياتهم اليومية. ومع ذلك، يجب أن

الإلكتروني: تحليل للتأثيرات السلبية على الصحة النفسية والاجتماعية","output":"يعتبر الإدمان الإلكتروني أحد التحديات الرئيسية التي تواجه المجتمعات الحديثة. فمع تطور التكنولوجيا وظهور العديد من الأجهزة الإلكترونية مثل الهواتف الذكية وأجهزة الكمبيوتر والألعاب الإلكترونية، أصبح الإدمان على هذه الأجهزة أكثر انتشارًا وتأثيرًا. تعريف الإدمان الإلكتروني يكمن في التوقعات الزائدة للأفراد للتفاعل مع الأجهزة الإلكترونية، وتميل أيضًا إلى التسبب في تأثيرات سلبية على الصحة النفسية والاجتماعية. يتراوح الإدمان الإلكتروني بين الألعاب الإلكترونية، ومواقع التواصل الاجتماعي، وتطبيقات الهواتف الذكية، والتلفاز، والإنترنت من أنواع أخرى. من الناحية النفسية، يعاني المدمنون الإلكترونيون من العديد من المشاكل المتعلقة بالصحة النفسية. فعندما يستخدم الأفراد الأجهزة الإلكترونية بشكل مفرط، يصبحون معزولين عن العالم الخارجي ويفتقرون إلى التفاعل الاجتماعي الحقيقي، مما يؤدي إلى ضعف مهارات التواصل واكتساب الثقة بالنفس. أيضًا، يمكن أن يسبب الإدمان الإلكتروني الاكتئاب والقلق والعزلة الاجتماعية. وتشير الدراسات إلى أن المدمنين على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي يعانون من اضطرابات نوم ومشاكل التركيز وانخفاض الذاكرة. أما من الناحية الاجتماعية، فقد تتأثر العلاقات الشخصية والاجتماعية بشكل سلبي بسبب الإدمان الإلكتروني. فعلى سبيل المثال، يمكن أن يتسبب الإدمان على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي في تهميش العلاقات الحقيقية وتجاهل العائلة والأصدقاء. كما يمكن أن يؤدي الإدمان الإلكتروني إلى تدهور الأداء الأكاديمي والعملي، مما يؤثر سلبًا على النجاح الشخصي والمهني. ومن الجدير بالذكر أن الإدمان على الألعاب الإلكترونية قد يؤدي أيضًا إلى انعزال الفرد عن الحياة الاجتماعية والتعليمية، مما يؤثر على نموهم وتطورهم العاطفي والاجتماعي. لمواجهة مشكلة الإدمان الإلكتروني، ينبغي على الفرد تطبيق بعض الاستراتيجيات الفعالة. من أهم هذه الاستراتيجيات الحد من الاستخدام المفرط للأجهزة الإلكترونية وتقليل الوقت الذي يقضيه في استخدامها. ينصح أيضًا بتوجيه الاهتمام إلى الأنشطة الاجتماعية والرياضية واستكشاف العالم الخارجي بدلاً من الاعتماد بشكل كبير على الأجهزة الإلكترونية. كما يمكن أن يكون من الفائدة البحث عن دعم من الأصدقاء والعائلة والمحترفين لمساعدة المدمنين على التخلص من الإدمان. في النهاية، يجب التعامل بجدية مع مشكلة الإدمان الإلكتروني وتوعية الجمهور حول تأثيراته السلبية على الصحة النفسية والاجتماعية. وعلى المستوى الشخصي، يجب أن يكون لدينا القدرة على التحكم في استخدام الأجهزة الإلكترونية واستغلالها بشكل مناسب، وذلك للحفاظ على صحتنا وسلامتنا النفسية والاجتماعية."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن أثر الأمانة في بناء المجتمعات: قيمة النزاهة والأمانة في تعزيز التنمية الاجتماعية والاقتصادية","output":"تعد الأمانة والنزاهة من القيم الأساسية التي تسهم في بناء المجتمعات القوية والمزدهرة. فعندما يتمتع أفراد المجتمع بالأمانة، يكون لديهم القدرة على التعاون والثقة المتبادلة، وهذا يعزز التنمية الاجتماعية والاقتصادية بشكل عام. تعد الأمانة خاصية هامة في الشخصية الفردية والمجتمعية، فالشخص الأمين هو الذي يلتزم بأخلاقيات العمل والحياة، ويتصرف بنزاهة في جميع التعاملات والمسؤوليات. يرتبط الأمين بهمس الضمير والإلتزام بالقوانين والقيم الأخلاقية. وعندما يكون أفراد المجتمع جميعهم أمناء، يتشكل مجتمع قائم على العدل والنزاهة. تلعب النزاهة والأمانة دوراً حاسماً في تعزيز التنمية الاجتماعية للمجتمعات. فعندما يكون هناك ثقة بين الأفراد، يتم بناء علاقات قوية قائمة على الصداقة والتعاون. وهذا يؤدي إلى تعزيز الروابط الاجتماعية والإخاء بين الناس، مما يخلق بيئة إيجابية ومترابطة. وبعد ذلك، تأتي فوائد تنموية متعددة من تلك الروابط المتينة، مثل تبادل المعرفة والخبرات وتعزيز الابتكار والتقدم الاجتماعي. وبالنسبة للتنمية الاقتصادية، تلعب النزاهة والأمانة أيضاً دوراً هاماً. فالشركات والمؤسسات التي تلتزم بالنزاهة والأمانة في أعمالها تكتسب شهرة جيدة وثقة العملاء والشركاء التجاريين. وهذا يساهم في تطور واستقرار الأعمال التجارية، وتحقيق الفوائد الاقتصادية المستدامة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تقلل النزاهة من الفساد والاحتيال، مما يخلق بيئة عادلة وشفافة للأعمال التجارية. من أجل بناء مجتمع قائم على الأمانة والنزاهة، يجب توجيه الجهود لتعزيز هذه القيم منذ الصغر. ينبغي أن نعلم أبناءنا قيمة الأمانة والنزاهة ونساعدهم على تطويرها من خلال التعليم والتوعية. ويجب أيضاً أن تتخذ المؤسسات الحكومية والخاصة إجراءات صارمة لمكافحة الفساد وتعزيز النزاهة في جميع مجالات العمل. في الختام، يظهر أن الأمانة والنزاهة لهما تأثير كبير في بناء المجتمعات الاقتصادية والاجتماعية. فعندما يكون هناك نزاهة في سلوك الأفراد والمؤسسات، يخلقون ثقة وأمان للجميع. وهذا يؤدي

نحو الخير والسلام، وفي هذا المقال سندرس هذا التأثير الهام. بدايةً، يجب أن نعلم أن الأنبياء هم رسل إلهيون تم اختيارهم وتعيينهم لنشر رسالة الله وتوجيه البشرية نحو الرشاد والسلوك الصالح. تنوعت رسالات الأنبياء حسب الزمان والمكان واحتياجات البشرية في تلك الحقبة. وكانت هذه الرسالات تهدف جميعها إلى تعليم الناس العدل والرحمة والتواضع والاعتدال والتعاون والسلام ونشر القيم الإنسانية الجوهرية، وذلك لبناء مجتمعات قائمة على العدل والتعاون والسلام والتقدم الروحي والمادي. في شبه الجزيرة العربية، رسل الله محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم، وموسى، وعيسى كان لهم تأثير كبير في تغيير مسار التاريخ وتحولات البشرية. لقد قادوا ثوراتٍ ثقافية واجتماعية جذرية ونشروا الإسلام واليهودية والمسيحية على التوالي. هذه الرسالات كان لها دور في نشر المعرفة والعلوم وتعليم الناس القيم والمبادئ السماوية. وكانوا يدعون الناس إلى تقوى الله والعمل الصالح والعدل والخير وقضاء حوائج الناس والتعاون مع الآخرين. ولم يقتصر تأثير الأنبياء على المستوى الروحي فحسب، بل تجاوز ذلك إلى التأثير الاجتماعي والسياسي أيضًا. فقد أسسوا أممًا وشعوبًا وحكومات، وقادوا ثورات شعبية ضد الظلم والاستبداد والتمييز والعنف. على سبيل المثال، النبي موسى قاد بني إسرائيل في ثورة ضد فرعون ونظامه الظالم، والنبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم قاد ثورة ضد الجاهلية والعنصرية والعنف في الجاهلية العربية. لا يمكن إنكار التأثير العميق الذي تركه الأنبياء على التاريخ والبشرية. إنهم وبفضل رسالاتهم الملهمة، وقدوتهم الفذة، وتعاليمهم السامية، غيروا عقليات الناس وعاداتهم وسلوكهم، وأشعلوا شرارة التغيير والتقدم في المجتمعات البشرية. ولذلك فإن الاحتفاء بتلك الشخصيات العظيمة والعمل على تطبيق تعاليمهم هو واجب وطني وأخلاقي في نفس الوقت. في الختام، يجب علينا أن نعترف بالأنبياء كمصدر للتغير الإيجابي في التاريخ وتحولات البشرية. إن تعاليمهم لا تزال حية ونافذة حتى يومنا هذا، وهي تحمل الرسالة نحو بناء مجتمعات مزدهرة وقيم محترمة. لذا، علينا أن نتعلم من تجاربهم ونسعى

للمعرفة. وبالتالي، يتعرض الفرد الأمي والمجتمع الذي يتراوح فيه مستوى الأمية للعديد من التحديات الاقتصادية والاجتماعية. يعود تأثير الأمية على التنمية إلى تأثيرها المباشر على الفرد ومساهمتها في تعزيز الفقر والعدالة الاجتماعية. يصبح الأفراد الأميين غير قادرين على الاستفادة من الفرص التعليمية والمهارات اللازمة لتطوير حياتهم الاقتصادية والاجتماعية. فهم يواجهون صعوبة في البحث عن فرص عمل جيدة ومستدامة ولا يمكنهم التكيف مع تطورات سوق العمل. علاوة على ذلك، قد يتعرض الأفراد الأميين لظروف عمل غير لائقة وأجور منخفضة، مما يؤثر سلبًا على دخلهم وجودتهم المعيشية. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يحد الأمية من قدرات الأفراد على المشاركة الفعالة في المجتمع واتخاذ القرارات المهمة. فهم غير قادرين على فهم الوثائق والاستماع إلى الآراء المختلفة والتعبير عن أنفسهم بطريقة فعالة. وبالتالي، يتأثر المشاركة السياسية والاجتماعية للأفراد وقدرتهم على مساهمة الفعّالة في عملية صنع القرارات. من المهم أيضًا ملاحظة أن الأمية تؤثر على الصحة والرفاهية. الأفراد الأميين يميلون إلى معرفة أقل بالمفاهيم الصحية والتغذية السليمة، مما يعني أنهم قد يصبحون أكثر عرضة للأمراض والعواقب الصحية السلبية. هذا يؤدي بدوره إلى زيادة تكاليف الرعاية الصحية والضغوط على النظام الصحي. تتعدد التحديات التي تواجه التعليم وتأثيرها على الأمية وبالتالي على التنمية الاقتصادية والاجتماعية. تشمل هذه التحديات الفجوة في الوصول إلى التعليم، حيث يعاني العديد من الأفراد من قلة الفرص والموارد التعليمية المتاحة لهم. كما تشمل التحديات الجودة التعليمية، حيث قد يكون هناك نقص في التعليم الجيد والمراكز التعليمية المؤهلة. لمعالجة هذه التحديات وتنشيط التنمية الاقتصادية والاجتماعية، يجب أن تولى الحكومات والمجتمع الدولي اهتمامًا بتوفير فرص التعليم للجميع وتحسين جودة التعليم. يجب أن يتم توفير الموارد اللازمة لتطوير البنية التحتية التعليمية وتدريب المعلمين وتعليم الكبار. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يجب أن تكون هناك حملات للتوعية بأهمية التعليم

Князь Владимир Святославович в X веке привез с собой из Корсуня (Херсонеса) первого митрополита, епископа, а сними и церковных певцов. При этом князе был организован церковно-певческий хор. Развитие русского церковного пения происходило не только благодаря взаимодействию с византийской традицией, но и исконной русской певческой культурой. Общей основой православного церковно-певческого искусства стало хоровое пение без инструментального сопровождения. Ему и сейчас свойственны протяженность мелодической линии, широта дыхания. Сюжеты церковных песнопений изображались на иконах, а иконы, в свою очередь, влияли на появление новых образцов этого жанра. Однако представление о русской церковной музыке будет неполным, без искусства колокольного звона, которое издавна пришлись по душе русскому человеку, а потому звонарное дело стало стремительно развиваться. Кто из великих русских композиторов (М.И. Глинка (1804–1857), М.П. Мусоргский (1839–1881), Н.А. Римский-Корсаков (1844–1908), С.В.

واحدًا من أكثر المصادر النظيفة والمتجددة والتي تعد من البدائل المستدامة للاعتماد على الوقود الأحفوري في تلبية احتياجات الطاقة. ومع ذلك، فإن استخدام الغاز الطبيعي يجلب التحسينات الكبيرة للبيئة، ولكن في نفس الوقت يحمل بعض التحديات البيئية التي يتعين التعامل معها بحذر. تأثيرات الغاز الطبيعي الإيجابية على البيئة واضحة وملموسة. للبدء، يعتبر الغاز الطبيعي أنظف مصدر للوقود في مقارنته مع الفحم والنفط، حيث يحرق الغاز الطبيعي أكثر نظافة ولا ينتج الكميات الضارة من الكبريت والأكسيدات التي تلوث الهواء. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن الاحتراق النظيف للغاز الطبيعي يؤدي إلى إنبعاثات أقل من غازات الاحتباس الحراري، مما يساهم في الحد من ظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري وتغير المناخ. علاوة على ذلك، يعد الغاز الطبيعي مصدرًا فعالًا للطاقة، حيث يتم استخدامه في إنتاج الكهرباء والتدفئة وتجهيز الطاقة في الصناعة. يعمل الاستخدام الفعال للغاز الطبيعي على تقليل استهلاك الطاقة وتحسين كفاءة الطاقة، مما يؤدي إلى تقليل انبعاثات الغازات الضارة واستخدام الموارد بشكل أكثر استدامة. ومع ذلك، تواجه استخدام الغاز الطبيعي بعض التحديات البيئية. على سبيل المثال، عند التنقيب عن الغاز الطبيعي واستخراجه، يمكن أن يحدث تلوث للتربة والمياه بسبب تسرب المواد الكيميائية المستخدمة في عمليات الحفر وتنقية الغاز. الاستفادة من الغاز الطبيعي ممكنة أيضًا من خلال عمليات استخراج ونقل الغاز الطبيعي، حيث يتعين على الشركات العاملة أن تأخذ الاحتياطات اللازمة لتجنب تسرب الغاز أثناء العمليات. هناك أيضًا التحدي البيئي المرتبط بالاحتراق غير النظيف للغاز الطبيعي، فعلى الرغم من أنه أنظف من الفحم والنفط، إلا أنه لا يزال ينتج ثاني أكسيد الكربون عند احتراقه، وهو غاز مساهم في زيادة ظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري. لذلك، يجب على الدول والشركات المعنية توجيه الاهتمام إلى تقليل هذه الانبعاثات والسعي لمزيد من الابتكار في تكنولوجيا استخدام الغاز الطبيعي بصورة أكثر فاعلية ونظافة. في الختام، يعد الغاز الطبيعي من المصادر النظيفة للطاقة والمتجددة، ويحمل التحسينات البيئية الهامة للبيئة. ومع ذلك، يتعين على المجتمع العالمي التعامل مع التحديات البيئية المرتبطة باستخدامه بحذر واتخاذ إجراءات لتقليل الانبعاثات الضارة والعمل على تطوير تكنولوجيا تعزز نظافة الاحتراق. بذلك، يمكننا استمرار استخدام الغاز الطبيعي كمصدر للطاقة المستدامة في المستقبل القريب."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن آثار إدمان الإنترنت: تأثيراته النفسية والاجتماعية على الفرد والمجتمع","output":"إن الانترنت قد أصبح جزءًا لا يتجزأ من حياتنا اليومية، حيث يتم استخدامه للاتصال والترفيه والتعليم والتسوق وغيرها من الأغراض. ومع ذلك، فإن الاعتماد المفرط على الإنترنت قد يؤدي إلى مشكلة الإدمان، وهو مشكلة تشكل تحديًا للفرد والمجتمع على حد سواء. تؤثر الإدمان على الإنترنت بشكل كبير على الصحة النفسية والاجتماعية للأفراد، وتؤثر أيضًا على العلاقات والديناميكيات الاجتماعية في المجتمع. تأثير الإدمان على الإنترنت ينعكس أولاً على الصحة النفسية للفرد. قد يسبب الإدمان على الإنترنت الشعور بالقلق والاكتئاب والعزلة الاجتماعية. يمضي الأشخاص الذين يعانون من هذه المشكلة ساعات طويلة أمام الشاشة، متجاهلين حاجاتهم الأساسية مثل النوم والتغذية السليمة، مما يتسبب في الشعور بالإجهاد والتعب. كما أن الإدمان على الإنترنت يميل إلى إلغاء التواصل الحقيقي مع الآخرين، مما يزيد من مشاعر العزلة والوحدة. بالإضافة إلى التأثير على الصحة النفسية، يؤثر الإدمان على الإنترنت أيضًا على الصحة الاجتماعية للأفراد. يميل المدمنون على الإنترنت إلى اهمال العلاقات الاجتماعية الحقيقية مع الأصدقاء والعائلة، مما يؤدي إلى تدهور تلك العلاقات. قد تصبح العائلة والأحباب غاضبين ومنزعجين بسبب الانغماس المفرط في الإنترنت، وقد يفقد الأشخاص المدمنون على الإنترنت الفرص الاجتماعية والتفاعل مع الآخرين في العالم الحقيقي. بالنسبة للمجتمع، يمكن أن يكون للإدمان على الإنترنت آثار سلبية جمة. فعلى سبيل المثال، قد يؤدي انخفاض الانخراط الاجتماعي إلى زيادة العزلة وقلة التفاعل الاجتماعي بين الأفراد في المجتمع. كما أن الإدمان على الإنترنت قد يؤثر على الأداء الأكاديمي والمهني للأفراد، حيث يتوقع منهم الانخراط في أنشطة فعالة وإنتاجية بدلاً من إضاعة الوقت على الإنترنت. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، قد يزيد الإدمان على الإنترنت من خطر الاحتيال والابتزاز والتنمر الإلكتروني. لحماية الفرد والمجتمع من آثار الإدمان على الإنترنت، ينبغي التركيز على التوعية بأضراره وتشجيع الاستخدام الصحي للإنترنت. يجب على الأفراد التحكم في وقتهم على الإنترنت وتحديد حدود صحية

البيئية والتحديات المستقبلية تمر الزراعة بتحولات هائلة في العقود الأخيرة، حيث تزايدت الطلبات على زيادة إنتاج الغذاء لتلبية الاحتياجات المتزايدة للسكان العالمية المتنامية. لتحقيق هذه الزيادة في الإنتاج، اعتمد المزارعون بشكل كبير على استخدام الأسمدة الكيميائية. ومع ذلك، فإن استخدام الأسمدة الكيميائية قد أثار العديد من المخاوف المتعلقة بالآثار البيئية. تشمل تأثيرات الأسمدة الكيميائية البيئية العديد من الجوانب المختلفة. على سبيل المثال، يؤدي استخدام الأسمدة الكيميائية إلى زيادة تراكيز النيتروجين والفوسفور في التربة والمياه الجوفية. تتسبب هذه الزيادة في زيادة نمو الطحالب والأعشاب المائية في البحيرات والأنهار، مما يؤدي إلى تدهور جودة المياه وفقدان التنوع البيولوجي. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تساهم الأسمدة الكيميائية في زيادة انبعاثات غازات الاحتباس الحراري، مما يؤدي إلى تغير المناخ وارتفاع درجات الحرارة. تحظى أيضًا التربة بتأثيرات سلبية جراء استخدام الأسمدة الكيميائية. تزيد تركيزات الأملاح الكيميائية من خلال استنزاف التربة وتسربها في المياه الجوفية، مما يؤدي إلى ضعف جودة التربة ومحاولة زيادة استخدام الأسمدة الكيميائية. وبالتالي، قد تتدهور هيكلة التربة وتقل قدرتها على استيعاب الماء والمواد الغذائية والحفاظ على الحياة الدقيقة. كما تسهم الأسمدة الكيميائية في تأثير القاعدة الحمضية للتربة، مما يزيد من تراكم الملوثات العضوية والثقيلة في التربة. بصورة عامة، فإن استخدام الأسمدة الكيميائية يؤدي إلى تفاقم مشكلة التلوث في البيئة. وتعتبر تلك التأثيرات نتيجة تلوث الهواء والماء والتربة وإضرار النظم البيئية الطبيعية. وفي العقبة، تواجه المزارعون والعلماء تحديات مستقبلية للحد من تأثيرات الأسمدة الكيميائية وتحقيق توازن بيئي. تتطلب المعالجة الفعالة لتأثيرات الأسمدة الكيميائية على البيئة تبني نهج شامل للزراعة المستدامة. يجب تحسين إدارة الأسمدة وتحسين كفاءة استخدامها، من خلال مراعاة التوقيت السليم لتطبيق الأسمدة واستخدام التقنيات المبتكرة التي تقلل من الفاقد وتحسن الاستفادة النباتية. كما يجب تشجيع التباين في استخدام الأسمدة من خلال تشجيع استخدام الأسمدة العضوية والحيوية والزراعة المعتمدة على الممارسات البيئية. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يجب تعزيز البحث العلمي والتطوير التكنولوجي للبحث عن أسمدة آمنة وفعالة وصديقة للبيئة. يجب أيضًا توعية المزارعين والجمهور حول تأثيرات الأسمدة الكيميائية وضرورة الانتقال إلى أساليب زراعية مستدامة. في الختام، تشير الدراسات الحالية إلى أن استخدام الأسمدة الكيميائية له تأثيرات سلبية على البيئة. لذا، فإن تحقيق التوازن بين الإنتاج الزراعي والحفاظ على البيئة يتطلب تطبيق الزراعة المستدامة واستخدام أساليب زراعية بيئية وفاعلة. يجب أن نعمل معًا كمجتمع عالمي لتحقيق هذه

حول التداول الحراري وتأثيره على الجهاز العصبي والأعضاء الحيوية","output":"ترتبط درجة حرارة الجسم المرتفعة بالعديد من الأمراض والمشكلات الصحية المختلفة. فعندما تزيد درجة حرارة جسم الإنسان عن المستوى الطبيعي، فإنها تؤثر على العديد من الأجهزة والأعضاء الحيوية، بما في ذلك الجهاز العصبي. تعتبر درجة حرارة الجسم المرتفعة من أعراض مشكلات صحية مختلفة، مثل الالتهابات المزمنة، التهابات الجهاز التنفسي العلوي، العدوى البكتيرية، والأمراض المعدية الأخرى. عندما يكون الجسم في حالة التهاب أو عدوى، يقوم الجهاز المناعي بزيادة درجة حرارة الجسم كاستراتيجية لمكافحة العدوى وتدمير الميكروبات الضارة. تؤثر الحرارة المرتفعة على الدورة الدموية وعملية التداول الحراري في الجسم. عندما يزيد مستوى الحرارة في الجسم، تتسبب الأوعية الدموية في التوسع لزيادة تدفق الدم والجرف الحراري لتخفيف الحرارة المتراكمة في الجسم. ومع ذلك، إذا استمرت درجة حرارة الجسم في الارتفاع لفترة طويلة، قد يتعرض الجهاز العصبي للضغط والتأثر. تؤثر درجة حرارة الجسم المرتفعة على الجهاز العصبي بأكثر من طريقة. فعندما يزيد الحرارة، يؤدي ذلك إلى توتر الأعصاب وزيادة نشاط الجهاز العصبي، مما يتسبب في زيادة مستوى التوتر والتهيج العصبي. قد يشعر الأفراد بالصداع والدوخة والاضطرابات العقلية والتشتت والنعاس بسبب ارتفاع درجة حرارتهم. علاوة على ذلك، الحمى أو الارتفاع المستمر في درجة حرارة الجسم يمكن أن يؤثر على أداء الأعضاء الحيوية الأساسية. فعندما تكون درجة حرارة الجسم مرتفعة، يعمل الجسم بوتيرة أسرع لتعويض التداول الحراري، مما يزيد من الحاجة إلى الأكسجين والطاقة من قبل الأعضاء. هذا العمل الإضافي يمكن أن يؤدي إلى تعب الأعضاء وقد يتسبب في مشاكل في وظائفها. قد يكون لارتفاع درجة حرارة الجسم تأثير سلبي أيضًا على عملية الأيض. فعندما يكون الجسم في حالة حمى مستمرة، يتطلب ذلك نشاطًا مستمرًا وزيادة في استهلاك الطاقة لتحافظ الخلايا على درجة حرارتها الطبيعية. هذا الاستهلاك الزائد للطاقة قد يؤدي بدوره إلى خفض معدل الأيض وتأثيره سلبًا على صحة الأعضاء ووظائفها. بشكل عام، يمكن القول أن ارتفاع درجة حرارة الجسم يؤثر على الصحة بشكل مباشر من خلال التأثير على الجهاز العصبي والأعضاء الحيوية. إذا كانت درجة حرارة الجسم مرتفعة لفترة طويلة أو إذا كانت هناك تقلبات كبيرة في درجة الحرارة، قد تحتاج إلى مراجعة الطبيب لتقييم وعلاج الحالة المرتبطة بذلك. تجنب التعرض للحرارة المرتفعة أو الاتزان الجيد للحرارة يمكن أن يلعب دورًا مهمًا في الحفاظ على صحة الجهاز

A photograph that captures the girl's emotions and the serene lake in the background, taken with a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV camera, using a 85mm lens to focus on the girl's face, creating a shallow depth of field that draws attention to her expression. The style of the photograph is reminiscent of candid portrait photography, highlighting the raw and genuine emotions of the moment. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: The entire room is filled with the girl's frustrated screams as she throws her comb away, the sound bouncing off the walls and reverberating through every corner, making her presence known to all. The scene takes place in a small bedroom, cluttered with various beauty products scattered across the dresser, posters of braided hairstyles adorning the walls, and a mirror reflecting the girl's annoyed reflection. The room is bathed in natural sunlight seeping through the curtains, casting long shadows and creating an atmosphere of heightened frustration. The composition focuses on the girl throwing the comb, with her hand mid-air and her face contorted with anger, capturing her explosive emotions. The illustration showcases the chaotic energy of the moment, with bold and vibrant colors enhancing the intensity of the scene. --ar 9:16 --v 5 /imagine prompt: The girl stands at the edge of the lake, throwing her comb in a fit of frustration, her hair flowing wildly in the wind. The lake is surrounded by tall trees, their leaves shimmering in shades of green as the sunlight filters through. The water sparkles with the reflection of the clear blue sky, creating a serene and tranquil environment that contrasts with the girl's turbulent emotions. The composition captures the girl in motion, her arm extended as she throws the comb, and her hair cascading through the air, forming dynamic lines. The artwork combines realistic elements with a touch of surrealism, blurring the boundaries between reality and imagination. --ar 16:9 --v 5 /imagine prompt: The girl's frustration fills the air as she throws her comb away, the sound echoing through an open field surrounded by rolling hills. The field is vibrant and lively, filled with wildflowers in various colors, adding a playful and whimsical touch to the scene. The sky above is a canvas of warm hues, transitioning from golden yellow to shades of pink and orange as the sun sets. The composition captures the girl's silhouette against the colorful sky, emphasizing her isolation and allowing the viewer to empathize with her emotions. The artwork is created using a mix of painting and digital manipulation, adding texture and depth to the scenery. --ar 9:16 --v 5.2"},{"instruction":"1.

Изменение системной модели мировоззрения России с течением времени: - В период Советского Союза основными принципами системной модели мировоззрения были материализм, интернационализм и классовая борьба. В этот период доминировало коммунистическое идеологическое направление. - С распадом Советского Союза и установлением многопартийной системы возникли новые идеологические направления, такие как либерализм, консерватизм и национализм. Системная модель мировоззрения стала более разнообразной и индивидуальной. - В последние десятилетия в России наблюдается усиление государственного влияния на системную модель мировоззрения.

Таким миросозерцанием, по его мнению, прониклось только Московское царство. Поэтому Г.В. Вернадский настаивал, что процессы по формированию единой российской государственности стали возможны только в Московский период.

الصغار، الذين يحبون التعلم والمشاركة في الأعمال الدينية بطرق بسيطة ومسلية. وفي هذا المقال سنستعرض خمسة أعمال دينية بسيطة وممتعة يمكن للأطفال تعلمها والتفاعل بها خلال شهر رمضان المبارك. 1- صيام نوايا صغيرة: يمكن للأطفال تعلم قيمة الصيام وتخليد هذا العمل في رمضان عبر صيام نوايا صغيرة. مثلاً، يمكنهم تحديد يوم في الأسبوع لصيامه، مثل يوم الجمعة أو السبت. يمكنهم أيضًا صيام نهار مشاركة في المدرسة أو في ناديهم الرياضي. هذا العمل يعلمهم التحلي بالصبر والقدرة على التحكم في رغباتهم. 2- الأذكار اليومية: يمكن للأطفال تعلم الأذكار اليومية وتكرارها بانتظام في رمضان. يمكنهم تعلم الأذكار الخاصة بالاستيقاظ والذهاب للفطور، والأذكار بعد الصلاة وقبل النوم. يمكنهم أيضًا إنشاء مخطوطة صغيرة يرسمون فيها الأذكار ويحفظونها. 3- الصدقة الجارية: يعلم الأطفال قيمة الصدقة وأنها ليست مقتصرة على إعطاء المال فقط. يمكنهم الاشتراك في حملة جمع الملابس القديمة وتوزيعها على المحتاجين أو تقديم الجدات في حيهم وجبة إفطار. هذا يعلمهم أنهم قادرين على مساعدة الآخرين والمساهمة في رفع البؤس عنهم. 4- القراءة والاستماع للقرآن: يمكن للأطفال تخصيص وقتٍ يومي لقراءة واستماع للقرآن الكريم. يمكنهم حفظ سورة صغيرة وتلاوتها للعائلة في وقت الإفطار، مثلاً. يمكنهم أيضًا قراءة قصة قصيرة عن أحد الأنبياء من القرآن ومناقشتها مع الأهل والأصدقاء. 5- تجهيز الحلويات التقليدية: يمكن للأطفال المشاركة في تجهيز الحلويات التقليدية لشهر رمضان، مثل المعمول والقطايف والمسمن. يمكنهم المساعدة في صنع العجينة وتشكيل الحلوى، مما يجعلهم يشعرون بالفرح والاحتفال بقدوم هذا الشهر الكريم. باختصار، يمكن للأطفال تعلم والتفاعل في الأعمال الدينية البسيطة خلال رمضان. ومن خلال هذه الأعمال، يكتسبون قيم إيمانية وقواعد سلوكية تساعدهم على التطور والنمو الروحي.

بالعهد","output":"الرسول محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم هو قدوة حسنة لجميع المسلمين، وكان يتسم بالأخلاق الفاضلة والأعمال الحسنة. في هذا المقال، سنذكر خمسة أحاديث تكشف عن أخلاق الرسول الكريم وتعلمنا قيمًا هامة مثل الصبر والحلم والعفو والوفاء بالعهد. 1- صبر النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: قد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: \\"إن مع العسر يسراً\\". ومعنى ذلك هو أنه في الصعوبات والمحن يجب أن نتحلى بالصبر ونثق بأن الله سيجعل الأمور سهلة في النهاية. فقد عاش الرسول حياة صعبة وواجه الكثير من التحديات، لكنه تحملها بصبر وثقة بالله. 2- حلم الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم: قد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: \\"من لا يرحم لا يُرحم\\". يدلنا هذا الحديث على أنه يجب أن نكون حلماء ورحماء تجاه الآخرين، بغض النظر عن أفعالهم أو أقوالهم. وكان الرسول دائم الحلم والعفو تجاه الناس، حتى في أصعب الظروف. 3- عفو النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: قد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: \\"من لا يرحم لا يُرحم\\". وكان الرسول يعفو عن من أساؤوا إليه ويسامح من أخطأوا. وهذا يعلمنا أنه عندما يسيء الناس إلينا، يجب أن نكون عفويين ونتجاوز عن الأذى ونحسن الظن بالآخرين. 4- وفاء النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بالعهد: كان الرسول يحرص على وفاء جميع عهوده واتفاقياته. وقد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: \\"يمين المؤمن غير مغلوب\\". يعلمنا هذا الحديث أنه يجب علينا أن نكون صادقين في العهود والتعهدات وأن نلتزم بوفاء الوعود التي نقطعها. 5- العفو والتسامح في الحياة اليومية: قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: \\"من لا يرحم الناس لا يرحمه الله\\". يعلمنا هذا الحديث أن العفو والتسامح هما طريقة الرسول في التعامل مع الآخرين. وبالتالي، يجب علينا أن نكون عفويين وتسامحيين في تعاملنا اليومي مع الناس. إن تعلم وتطبيق هذه القيم النبيلة من أخلاق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم هو أمر مهم جدًا، حيث يمكن أن تسهم في خلق مجتمع يسوده السلام والتعاون والتسامح. فالنبي الكريم قدوة لنا جميعًا في تعاملنا مع الآخرين وإيماننا بالله."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن ترتيب ساعة نوم طفلك بشكل فعّال: 5 خطوات لضبط النوم بدون الحاجة إلى علامات","output":"ترتيب ساعة نوم الطفل بشكل فعّال: 5 خطوات لضبط النوم بدون الحاجة إلى علامات يعتبر النوم الجيد أمرًا حيويًا لنمو وتطور الطفل. قد يواجه الأهل صعوبة في ضبط ساعة نوم الطفل ، وخاصةً في الأشهر الأولى من حياته. ومع ذلك ، هناك خمس خطوات يمكن اتباعها لمساعدتك في ترتيب ساعة نوم طفلك بشكل فعال وبدون الحاجة إلى علامات. 1. تحديد جدول زمني ثابت: ينصح بتحديد جدول زمني ثابت للطفل للذهاب إلى النوم والاستيقاظ في نفس الوقت كل يوم. ينصح بأن يكون طفلك في السرير في الليل وفي المساء في نفس الوقت بشكل منتظم. هذا يساعد على تنظيم ساعة نومه ويسهل عليه النوم والاستيقاظ في الوقت المناسب. 2. إنشاء رتوال للنوم: يفضل إنشاء رتوال يساعد طفلك على الاسترخاء قبل النوم. يمكن أن يشمل رتوال النوم قراءة قصة معينة أو تغني نشيد معين أو حتى تنفيذ بعض التمارين الهادئة مثل تمارين التنفس العميق. يجب أن يتم تطبيق هذا الرتوال يوميًا قبل النوم للمساعدة في إشارة لطفلك أن النوم بات قريبًا. 3. بيئة نوم مهيأة: يوصى بإعداد بيئة نوم مهيأة في غرفة الطفل. يجب أن يكون المكان هادئًا ومعتمًا ، وأن يكون السرير مريحًا ومناسبًا للنوم. يمكن أن تساعد الموسيقى الهادئة أو ضوء النوم الخافت في تهدئة الطفل وتشجيعه على النوم بشكل أفضل. 4. تنظيم النوم النهاري: يجب تنظيم فترات النوم النهارية للطفل أيضًا. ينصح بتقديم وقت نوم ثابت خلال النهار ، وتجنب السماح للطفل بالنوم في الوقت القريب من ساعة النوم المعتادة له في الليل. ينصح بتقليل مدة النوم النهاري كلما كبر الطفل ، حتى يتمكن من النوم لفترة أطول خلال الليل. 5. إنشاء روتين قبل النوم: ينبغي تنفيذ نشاط هادئ ومريح قبل النوم ، مثل الاستماع إلى الموسيقى الهادئة أو تنفيذ ممارسة التنفس العميق. يخلق هذا الروتين الهادئ بيئةً تساعد الطفل على الاسترخاء قبل النوم ويعلمه أن النوم قريبًا. تذكر ، قد يستغرق الأمر بعض الوقت لتعلم الطفل ترتيب ساعة نومه بشكل فعال. يجب أن يبقى الأهل صبورين وثابتين أثناء تطبيق هذه الخطوات وتعديل الجدول الزمني للأطفال حسب احتياجاتهم الفردية. باستمرار إعطاء الطفل إشارات واضحة حول متى يجب النوم والاستيقاظ ، ستكون هذه الخطوات الخمسة هي الأساس لإقامة ساعة نوم فعالة ومنتظمة لطفلك."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن

Во-первых, большая часть населения поддерживала коммунистическую идеологию и считала Советский Союз и его руководство законными и правильными. Во-вторых, существовала мощная аппаратно-партийная система, которая управляла страной и контролировала все сферы общественной жизни. Третий фактор связан с экономическим достижениями СССР, такими как индустриализация, коллективизация сельского хозяйства и прочие социальные программы, которые создали впечатление о благополучии и развитии страны. Кроме того, заслугой СССР можно считать успешное выживание во время Второй мировой войны и его весомую роль в победе над нацистской Германией. Однако, необходимо отметить, что легитимность советской власти также была подорвана некоторыми факторами. Политические репрессии, нарушение прав человека и ограничение свободы высказывания вызывали определенное недовольство населения. Также, коррупция и некомпетентность в некоторых сферах управления создали негативное отношение к власти. В последние годы СССР, недостаточное удовлетворение потребностей населения и экономический спад также усилили неудовольствие и недоверие к руководству страны. В целом, легитимность государственной власти в СССР была очень комплексной и зависела от различных факторов.

Это связано с необходимостью балансирования государственной власти и предотвращения возможного злоупотребления президентом своими полномочиями. Следует отметить, что президентская власть в России существенно изменилась с момента своего возникновения. В начале 1990-х годов, после развала СССР, президентская власть была относительно слабой, и президент не обладал столь широкими полномочиями, как в настоящее время. С развитием политической системы России произошли изменения в конституции, в результате чего президент получил больше полномочий и стал фактически главой исполнительной власти. Однако, с ростом полномочий президента также возникла необходимость установления ограничений и рамок для его действий. Это произошло в результате изменений в Конституции, которые были введены в 2008 году, и включают ограничение числа сроков, которые президент может провести на посту, а также усиление роли Федерального Собрания и судебной власти. Конституционализация президентских полномочий в современной России важна для обеспечения соблюдения прав и свобод граждан, а также для поддержания баланса между ветвями власти.

Definicja: Zespół krótkiego jelita to choroba jelit charakteryzująca się znacznym skróceniem jelita cienkiego. Normalnie, jelito cienkie ma około 6-7 metrów długości, ale w przypadku zespołu krótkiego jelita, długość jelita jest znacznie mniejsza, zazwyczaj mniej niż 2 metry. Skrócenie jelita cienkiego może być wynikiem różnych czynników, takich jak usunięcie chirurgiczne części jelita, wrodzone wady rozwojowe lub choroby przewlekłe. 2. Co oznacza pojęcie \\"krótkie jelito\\"? Pojęcie \\"krótkie jelito\\" odnosi się do sytuacji, w której jelito cienkie jest znacznie krótsze niż normalnie. Jelito cienkie jest odpowiedzialne za wchłanianie składników odżywczych z pokarmu, dlatego skrócenie jelita może prowadzić do niedoborów pokarmowych i zaburzeń żywieniowych. 3. Epidemiologia: Zespół krótkiego jelita jest stosunkowo rzadkim schorzeniem. Dane epidemiologiczne są ograniczone, ale szacuje się, że zespół krótkiego jelita występuje u około 30-40% pacjentów po resekcji jelita cienkiego. Przyczyną zespołu krótkiego jelita może być także samoistne zapalenie jelita, choroba Crohna, nowotwory jelita czy też wrodzone wady rozwojowe. 4. Przyczyny powstawania: Główną przyczyną zespołu krótkiego jelita jest resekcja (usunięcie chirurgiczne) części jelita cienkiego. Może to być konieczne w przypadku chorób jelita, takich jak choroba Crohna, nowotwory jelita, niedrożność jelita lub urazy. Inne przyczyny to wrodzone wady rozwojowe jelita oraz choroby, takie jak samoistne zapalenie jelita czy też niedokrwistość jelita. 5. Objawy: Objawy zespołu krótkiego jelita mogą różnić się w zależności od stopnia skrócenia jelita i możliwości wchłaniania składników odżywczych. Najczęstsze objawy to biegunka, wzdęcia, niedrożność jelita, nudności, wymioty, osłabienie, utrata masy ciała, niedokrwistość, niedobory witamin i minerałów. 6. Diagnostyka: Diagnostyka zespołu krótkiego jelita obejmuje szczegółowy wywiad medyczny, badanie fizykalne, badania laboratoryjne (badanie kału, morfologia krwi, poziomy elektrolitów, witamin i innych składników odżywczych), a także badania obrazowe, takie jak tomografia komputerowa, rezonans magnetyczny czy też endoskopia. 7. Leczenie: Leczenie zespołu krótkiego jelita jest skomplikowane i zazwyczaj obejmuje zarówno farmakoterapię, jak i interwencje żywieniowe. Celem leczenia jest skompensowanie niedoborów składników odżywczych i utrzymanie odpowiedniego stanu skórno-mięśniowo-kostnego pacjenta. Może być konieczne podawanie dożylnego odżywiania parenteralnego w przypadku ciężkich objawów. 8. Problemy żywieniowe pacjentów: Pacjenci z zespołem krótkiego jelita mogą mieć problemy z odpowiednim wchłanianiem składników odżywczych, co prowadzi do niedoborów i zaburzeń żywieniowych. Mogą występować niedobory witamin, minerałów, a także białka, tłuszczów i węglowodanów. Konieczne jest monitorowanie stanu żywieniowego pacjentów i dostosowanie diety oraz suplementacji. 9. Zalecenia żywieniowe/leczenie dietetyczne: Leczenie dietetyczne zespołu krótkiego jelita jest oparte na indywidualnych potrzebach pacjenta i może wymagać dostosowania ilości i rodzaju spożywanych posiłków, stosowania specjalnych diet o zwiększonej ilości białka, tłuszczów lub węglowodanów. Często konieczne jest podawanie suplementów witamin, minerałów oraz preparatów enzymatycznych. Ważne jest również monitorowanie stanu żywieniowego pacjenta i regularne badania laboratoryjne. 10.

There's a chance it could be a niche or local website focused on weather patterns as they relate to bird watching, migration patterns, or something similar. Websites change, and new services emerge all the time, though, and it's possible that BirdWeather is a recent development or a small-scale project that hasn't gained widespread attention yet. To get the most current and accurate information about BirdWeather, please provide more details or check directly on the web by conducting a search to see if the website now exists and what its purpose may be.

However, there could be several reasons why the price box isn't updating. Here are some troubleshooting steps and considerations: 1. **Reactivity:** Make sure that \`items\` is a reactive data property of your Vue component. Vue can't track changes to properties that weren't reactive from the start. 2. **Correct Property Name:** Double-check that \`data\` is indeed the new price and that it's a Number or String, not an Object, unless \`items.pris\` is supposed to be an Object and you handle it correctly in your InputText component. 3. **Props vs. Data:** If you're using props to pass \`items\` to a child component, know that you typically shouldn't mutate props directly. Instead, you should emit an event and handle the change in the parent component. 4. **Component Update Lifecycle:** Sometimes custom components like \`InputText\` may not respond immediately to prop changes due to internal state that isn't watching for changes. Make sure \`InputText\` properly watches and responds to \`v-model\` changes. 5. **Error Handling:** Add error handling in your async function to ensure that network or server-side errors are being caught and handled, this can contribute to \`items.pris\` not being updated. 6. **Component Rendering:** Somewhere you must tell Vue to actually re-render the component that contains the updated \`items.pris\`. Vue should automatically do this when \`items.pris\` is changed if the change is detected, but if the change isn’t detected because of the reasons above, the component won’t re-render. Here's a simplified version of your Vuex component, assuming you're using Vuex: \`\`\`javascript export default { data() { return { items: { ord_pris: '', pris: '' } }; }, methods: { async updatePrice(kategori, pris) { ... const response = await this.authFetch(...); const data = await response.json(); console.log(data); this.items.pris = data.newPrice; // Assuming 'newPrice' is the key in the response with the actual price. } } }; \`\`\` And for error handling, something like this: \`\`\`javascript async updatePrice(kategori, pris) { try { const response = await this.authFetch(...); if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok.'); const data = await response.json(); this.items.pris = data.newPrice; } catch (error) { console.error('Fetch error:', error); } }, \`\`\` Also, ensure that your \`updatePrice\` function is being called correctly. Since \`updatePrice\` is supposed to handle the \`@change\` event from \`InputText\`, confirm that \`InputText\` emits this event when the value changes. If \`InputText\` is a custom component, you might need to ensure that it correctly emits change events when its value changes. If these steps don't fix the issue, it might be helpful to inspect the state of \`items\` throughout the component using Vue Devtools to have a clearer idea of where the process is failing."},{"instruction":"the response is just 60 nothing else","output":"If the response is the numerical value 60 and nothing else, it seems you are expecting to receive this value directly and not as a property of an object. In that case, you simply need to assign \`data\` to \`items.pris\` directly, without trying to access a \`newPrice\` property or any other property on \`data\`. Here is how you would update your \`updatePrice\` function: \`\`\`javascript async updatePrice(kategori, pris) { try { const response = await this.authFetch(\`{this.host}avgprice\`, { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ kategori, pris }) }); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); } // If response is just a number (e.g., 60), assign it directly. const data = await response.json(); console.log(data); this.items.pris = data; // assign the number directly since response is just 60 } catch (error) { console.error('Fetch error:', error); } }, \`\`\` Since the response is just a number (60 in this case), you should be able to assign that number directly to \`this.items.pris\`, and if \`items\` is a reactive data property, your \`InputText\` component for \`pris\` should automatically update to reflect this new value. Make sure that the \`InputText\` component is properly bound with \`v-model\` so that it updates when its model value changes. If \`InputText\` is a custom component, it should have a model option for proper v-model integration, like so: \`\`\`javascript Vue.component('input-text', { props: ['value'], template: \` <input :value=\\"value\\" @input=\\"emit('input', event.target.value)\\"> \` }); \`\`\` And ensure your component's data property is reactive when the component is created. If you add new properties to an object after it has been made reactive, Vue will not be able to track changes to those new properties. It's a common gotcha with Vue's reactivity system. If you've verified all of these points and the problem still exists, also check to see if you have any additional logic in your template or elsewhere in your code that might be interfering with the update."},{"instruction":"force an update in nuxt vue","output":"In Vue and Nuxt, under normal circumstances, updates should happen automatically due to Vue’s reactivity system, which tracks changes to reactive data and updates the DOM accordingly. However, there might be rare cases where you have to force an update. Here are a couple methods for forcing an update in Vue (which applies to Nuxt as well): # 1. Using \`vm.forceUpdate()\` Method You can use the \`forceUpdate()\` method on your Vue instance (often referred to as \`vm\`) to force the component to re-render. This can be useful if you've modified an object's property or array's element directly without Vue being able to detect the change (which is against Vue's reactivity rules). \`\`\`javascript this.forceUpdate(); \`\`\` # 2. Keyed \`v-for\` The \`key\` attribute is often used in Vue to help track each node's identity in a list, which can be useful if you're rendering a list of items using \`v-for\`. When you change keys, Vue knows that it should re-render those elements in the DOM. \`\`\`html <div v-for=\\"(item, index) in items\\" :key=\\"item.id\\"> <!-- content --> </div> \`\`\` To force an update, you could change the keys of the items in your list. # 3. Changing References In Vue, reactivity is based on references. If you change the reference to an object or array, Vue will detect it and re-render the relevant components. For example, instead of directly modifying an array, you could replace it with a new array containing the changes. \`\`\`javascript this.items = [...this.items, newItem]; \`\`\` # 4. Watching for Deep Changes If you have an object and you need to watch for deep changes, you can use a watcher with the \`deep\` option. \`\`\`javascript watch: { someObject: { handler(newValue, oldValue) { // handle the change }, deep: true } } \`\`\` # In Nuxt Context Above methods apply to Nuxt as well, as Nuxt is built on top of Vue. Here are some Nuxt-specific considerations: - **Page Component Watchers:** If you're in a Nuxt page component, ensure that you're fetching data in the correct lifecycle hook, like \`asyncData\` or \`fetch\`, which are Nuxt-specific. - **Store:** If you're using Vuex, ensure that the state is changed through mutations and actions properly, as direct changes to state won't be reactive. - **Plugins and Modules:** If you're using plugins or modules, ensure they're not affecting the reactivity of your components in unexpected ways. Keep in mind that forcing an update should be done sparingly and usually indicates that there is a deeper issue with your approach to Vue's reactivity system. It's best to first check why Vue's reactivity isn't working as expected and fix the root cause, rather than resorting to forcing updates."},{"instruction":"is this right?: <Dropdown id=\\"kategori\\" v-model=\\"items.kategori\\" :options=\\"category.items\\" placeholder=\\"Select One\\" @change=\\"updatePrice(items.kategori, items.ord_pris)\\" />","output":"The syntax you’ve used for the Dropdown component with a v-model and an @change event listener seems correct in terms of listening for changes and then triggering the \`updatePrice\` method when the value changes. However, you might want to consider a couple of things: 1. **Event Handling and v-model Synchronization**: When you use \`v-model\` in Vue, it automatically updates the bound model on the \`input\` event for input fields or the \`change\` event for select boxes. This means that when you select a new option in the dropdown, \`items.kategori\` should automatically get updated by Vue’s v-model two-way data binding. Therefore, you might not need to explicitly pass \`items.kategori\` to the \`updatePrice\` method since the model \`items.kategori\` will already be updated when the \`change\` event is emitted. Depending on how the \`Dropdown\` component is implemented, you could simply call \`updatePrice\` without arguments, and then within \`updatePrice\`, refer directly to \`this.items.kategori\` and \`this.items.ord_pris\`. 2. **Event Data**: Some UI libraries or custom components emit additional data along with the \`change\` event (for instance, the value of the selected option). You can capture this value directly from the event if needed. Here’s how your code could look with these considerations in mind: \`\`\`html <Dropdown id=\\"kategori\\" v-model=\\"items.kategori\\" :options=\\"category.items\\" placeholder=\\"Select One\\" @change=\\"updatePrice\\" /> \`\`\` And in your methods, it might look like: \`\`\`javascript methods: { async updatePrice() { // Access the latest value of items.kategori as it is bound with v-model const kategori = this.items.kategori; const ord_pris = this.items.ord_pris; // Call your API or process the new price const newPrice = await this.fetchNewPrice(kategori, ord_pris); this.items.pris = newPrice; // Update the price }, async fetchNewPrice(kategori, ord_pris) { // API call to fetch new price logic here // For demonstration purposes, let's say the call returns the new price directly const response = await this.authFetch(...) const data = await response.json(); return data; // Assuming the response is just the new price } } \`\`\` Remember to handle errors and check if the Dropdown component used is in conformance with this pattern. If it is a third-party component, you may want to check its documentation to see exactly how it emits the \`change\` event and what arguments, if any, it provides."},{"instruction":"rephrase it.........Due to below outstanding Jenkins issue, I've been facing considerable delays in my project work progress.

Когда покупал автомобиль Хендай Солярис в Каргианте, то мне обещали, что никаких пени не начислят, при досрочном погашении.

Мелочные душенки!!!","output":"Я с волнением и доверием отправился в Хит Авто в погоне за своей мечтой – Шкода Октавия 2011 года с заманчивой ценой в 355 тысяч. В голове были сомнения: почему так дёшево? И вот, глядя на машину, я увидел ответ – кузов помяли, как будто её в футбол играли, а мотор стучал, как старые часы. Выходит, секрет цены – в этих бедах. Честно, я расстроился, потому что Хит Авто для меня теперь – это символ разочарования. Загорелся я в своё время идеей купить Форд Кугу в Хит Авто – ценник играл на их сторону. \\"Может, повезет?\\" – думал я до того момента, пока не узнал всю правду. Оказалось, на авто висят долги, оно в залоге. Надежды на чудо развеялись, как дым. Понял я тогда: в следующий раз буду проверять всё как следует, чтобы не попасть в такую же ситуацию. Я словно в кино ужасов оказался, когда зашёл в Хит Авто. Смотрю я на авто, а они словно монстры из разных частей склеены! Разные марки деталей, сварка видится без труда. И цена? Космос! Продавец улыбается в лицо, словно всё чин-чином, а мне в голове только одно: \\"Сейчас поеду – и оно развалится прямо на ходу!\\" Не хотелось бы чувствовать себя обманутым покупателем... Ещё я помню, как залог в 50 тысяч оставил в Хит Авто за фольксваген поло для жены. \\"Вот будет сюрприз!\\" – думал. В итоге месяц ожидания, обещания, и только суд помог вернуть залог. Как будто только сильным давление воздействует на них. Наученный горьким опытом, я бы подумал дважды, прежде чем снова туда обратиться. Как же я был возмущён, когда приехал за новым Киа Рио в Хит Авто! Обещали, что машина будет ждать меня, а на деле – нулевой выбор, всё под заказ только. Сколько можно водить клиентов за нос? Считаю неприемлемым такой подход к продажам, и мой совет – думайте дважды, прежде чем отправляться к ним. И самое яростное разочарование – когда при покупке Хендай Солярис в Хит Авто говорили, что никаких штрафов за досрочное погашение не будет. А потом – бац, и штраф в 42500 из ниоткуда. Обещания их оказались обманом чистой воды. Совершили подмену договора, а я плачу за их хитрости.

Since altering Group Policy can affect the security and behavior of numerous computers, it's important that this task is performed by someone with the correct administrative privileges and expertise. Here's what you typically need to do: 1. **Open Group Policy Editor**: On the server or computer with the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) installed, go to \`Start\`, type \`gpmc.msc\`, and press Enter. 2. **Locate the Appropriate Policy**: Navigate through the console tree to the policy that restricts downloads for Chrome. This would typically be a policy applied to your user's organizational unit (OU). 3. **Edit the Policy**: Right-click on the policy, and select \`Edit\` to modify the policy. 4. **Navigate to the Chrome Policies**: Navigate to the Chrome policies which might be located under \`User Configuration\` > \`Policies\` > \`Administrative Templates\` > \`Google\` > \`Google Chrome\`. 5. **Find the Download Restrictions**: Look for the setting that is restricting downloads. This could be under \`Google Chrome - Default Settings (users can override)\` or more restrictive settings that users cannot change. Common policy settings related to file downloads are: - \`Allow download restrictions\` - \`Block access to a list of URLs\` - \`Allow access to a list of URLs\` 6. **Adjust Settings to Allow .bat Downloads**: - If download restrictions are set by file types, you will need to find the specific setting that blocks executable file types and ensure that \`.bat\` files are not included in the block list. - If there's a whitelist for allowed URLs, you can add the specific URLs from where \`.bat\` files can be downloaded. 7. **Add Whitelist Entry for .bat files** (if necessary): If your policy specifically blocks certain file types, you may have to create an exception for .bat files. There might be a setting like \\"Block dangerous downloads,\\" where you can add an exception. 8. **Apply the Policy**: Once you have made the necessary changes, click \`Ok\` to save the settings changes. You may also need to run \`gpupdate /force\` from the command line to force immediate policy update, or you could wait for the next group policy refresh cycle. 9. **Test the Policy**: Test the modified policy to ensure that .bat files can be downloaded while other types of downloads remain restricted as per your organization's policy. Do this on a user's computer that falls under the policy scope. **Important**: \`.bat\` files can be potentially hazardous as they can execute commands on a user's system. If you are allowing such files to be downloaded, ensure that adequate training, security measures, and malware protection are in place to prevent misuse or harm to your network. Always consult your organization's IT policy and, if necessary, your legal and compliance department before allowing potentially unsafe file downloads."},{"instruction":"generate an image of a dog","output":"As an AI text-based model, I am not able to directly create or generate images, including images of dogs.

(1)Я знала замечательную писательницу. (2)Её звали Тамара Григорьевна Габбе. (3)Она сказала мне однажды: – В жизни много испытаний. (4)Их не перечислишь. (5)Но вот три, они встречаются часто. (6)Первое – испытание нуждой. (7)Второе – благополучием, славой. (8)А третье испытание – страхом. (9)И не только тем страхом, который узнаёт человек на войне, а страхом, который настигает его в обычной, мирной жизни. (10)Что же это за страх, который не грозит ни смертью, ни увечьем? (11)Не выдумка ли он? (12)Нет, не выдумка. (13)Страх многолик, иногда он поражает бесстрашных. (14)«Удивительное дело, – писал поэт-декабрист Рылеев, – мы не страшимся умирать на полях битв, но слово боимся сказать в пользу справедливости». (15)С тех пор как написаны эти слова, прошло много лет, но есть живучие болезни души. (16)Человек прошёл войну как герой. (17)Он ходил в разведку, где каждый шаг грозил ему гибелью. (18)Он воевал в воздухе и под водой, он не бегал от опасности, бесстрашно шёл ей навстречу. (19)И вот война кончилась, человек вернулся домой. (20)К своей семье, к своей мирной работе. (21)Он работал так же хорошо, как и воевал: со страстью отдавая все силы, не жалея здоровья. (22)Но когда по навету клеветника сняли с работы его друга, человека, которого он знал, как себя, в невиновности которого он был убеждён, как в своей собственной, он не вступился. (23)Он, не боявшийся ни пуль, ни танков, испугался. (24)Он не страшился смерти на поле битвы, но побоялся сказать слово в пользу справедливости. (25)Мальчишка разбил стекло. – (26)Кто это сделал? – спрашивает учитель. (27)Мальчишка молчит. (28)Он не боится слететь на лыжах с самой головокружительной горы. (29)Он не боится переплыть незнакомую реку, полную коварных воронок. (30)Но он боится сказать: «Стекло разбил я». (31)Чего он боится? (32)Слетая с горы, он может свернуть себе шею. (33)Переплывая реку, может утонуть. (34)Слова «это сделал я» не грозят ему смертью. (35)Почему же он боится их произнести? (36)Я слышала, как очень храбрый человек, прошедший войну, сказал однажды: «Бывало страшно, очень страшно». (37)Он говорил правду: ему бывало страшно. (38)Но он умел преодолеть свой страх и делал то, что велел ему долг: он сражался. (39)В мирной жизни, конечно, тоже может быть страшно. (40)Я скажу правду, а меня за это исключат из школы... (41)Скажу правду – уволят с работы... (42)Уж лучше промолчу. (43)Много пословиц есть на свете, которые оправдывают молчание, и, пожалуй, самая выразительная: «Моя хата с краю». (44)Но хат, которые были бы с краю, нет. (45)Мы все в ответе за то, что делается вокруг нас. (46)В ответе за всё плохое и за всё хорошее. (47)И не надо думать, будто настоящее испытание приходит к человеку только в какие-то особые, роковые минуты: на войне, во время какой-нибудь катастрофы. (48)Нет, не только в исключительных обстоятельствах, не только в час смертельной опасности, под пулей испытывается человеческое мужество. (49)Оно испытывается постоянно, в самых обычных житейских делах. (50)Мужество бывает одно. (51)Оно требует, чтобы человек умел преодолевать в себе обезьяну всегда: в бою, на улице, на собрании. (52)Ведь слово «мужество» не имеет множественного числа. (53)Оно в любых условиях одно.","output":"Прочитанный текст затрагивает тему мужества и страха в повседневной жизни по сравнению с экстремальными ситуациями, такими как война. Основная проблема, поставленная автором текста, заключается в трудности преодоления страха при отстаивании справедливости и правды в обычной жизни. Пример-иллюстрация №1: Герой войны, не боявшийся смерти на боевых полях, испугался поддержать товарища в мирной жизни (строки 16-24). Это показывает, что даже те, кто проявлял героизм в экстремальных условиях, могут оказаться рабами страха в бытовых обстоятельствах. Пример-иллюстрация №2: Мальчик, который легко берет на себя риски в спортивных ситуациях, боится признаться в разбитом стекле (строки 25-35). Это демонстрирует, что страх подвергнуться осуждению может быть более силён, чем страх физических опасностей. Смысловая связь между этими примерами заключается в том, что они оба показывают трудности предания себя в мирных условиях, что требует иного рода мужества, нежели героизм в ликвидации физической опасности. Автор текста подчеркивает, что испытание мужеством происходит не только в экстремальных ситуациях, но ежедневно, и требует стойкости и способности говорить правду перед лицом социальных репрессий и осуждения. Позиция автора выражается в призыве к мужеству в повседневной жизни и ответственности перед обществом. Я разделяю позицию автора, подчёркивая, что гражданская смелость и готовность защищать справедливость важны для здоровья общества. Примеры гороха, который сумел преодолеть страх на войне, но сдавшийся перед лицом несправедливости, и мальчика, боящегося признания, подчеркивают, что мужество в повседневных делах мало чем отличается от боевого героизма и так же ценно."},{"instruction":"Write a Python code to select and upload images from a Jupyter Notebook","output":"In a Jupyter Notebook, you can create a widget to select and upload images using \`ipywidgets\` and \`IPython.display\`. The following Python code snippet demonstrates how to do this: First, make sure you have \`ipywidgets\` installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already: \`\`\`bash pip install ipywidgets \`\`\` Next, you can use the following code in a Jupyter Notebook cell to create an image upload widget: \`\`\`python import ipywidgets as widgets from IPython.display import display, Image from io import BytesIO # Create an Upload widget uploader = widgets.FileUpload( accept='image/*', # Accepts only image files multiple=True # Allows multiple file uploads ) # Function to handle the uploaded image data def handle_upload_change(change): for uploaded_filename in uploader.value: print(f\\"Uploaded {uploaded_filename}\\") image_data = uploader.value[uploaded_filename]['content'] image = Image(value=image_data) display(image) # Bind the function to the upload widget uploader.observe(handle_upload_change, names='value') # Display the upload widget display(uploader) \`\`\` When you run the above code cell, you'll get a \\"Browse\\" button.

Please note that the uploaded images are stored in the memory (as a BytesIO object), and if you need to save the images to disk or perform further operations, you will need to modify the \`handle_upload_change\` function above accordingly.

如果\`AgentToolExecutor\`是自己编写的类，并且你希望它能够支持下标操作，那么你需要在类中实现特殊方法\`__getitem__\`。 - 如果\`AgentToolExecutor\`原本就不应该支持下标操作，那你或许是误将它当做了一个列表或字典。检查你的代码，确保你在正确的对象上进行操作。 - 如果你认为\`AgentToolExecutor\`应该有类似字典的行为，检查是否存在类似\`get\`或者其它相应的方法来替代下标操作。 -

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman made a poopy in her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, infantilizingly marvels that the returning woman has made an exceptionally big stinky in her pants, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. Then, the present woman tauntingly adds that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman stands in coy resignation as she's being examined by the present woman, timidly replying that the mess in her pants feels warm, soft, and surprisingly comforting now that it is out of her stomach after all that pressure the returning woman felt. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand while her face displays an inappropriate degree of complacency. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"Title: \\"A Key Moment of Relief\\" Genre: Comedy Drama FADE IN: BACKGROUND: In the previous scene, we watched LAYLA NAJEM, a twenty-two-year-old Lebanese American college senior, fervently networking at an off-campus soiree. The audience caught glimpses of Layla nibbling on savory appetizers, sipping on sparkling water, and growing increasingly uneasy as her stomach began to protest the mixture of exotic foods. All attempts to use the restroom were thwarted by numerous academic discussions that she couldn't excuse herself from without seeming rude or disinterested. Finally en route home, Layla's harrowing journey is displayed in a montage of near-misses with public restrooms and indecisive moments, culminating in her hasty exit from a cab a block away from home, convinced she could hold until she reaches her sanctuary. EXT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT Layla, sharp and ambitious with a mane of curly hair and expressive eyes, dashes towards the front door. Her fashion-forward ensemble includes a pair of relaxed leather pants that squeak with every urgent step. Her face is a canvas of concentration and discomfort. LAYLA: (swearing under her breath) Not now... C'mon, not now! She fumbles for her keys, searching each pocket in despair, her movements erratic and uncoordinated. In her state of escalating urgency, it becomes evident: the house key is gone. With barely a second thought, Layla begins KNOCKING frantically, each thump underscored by the simple desire for relief. LAYLA: (whispering) Open up, open up... The house remains silent. Seconds morph into agonizing eternities. Layla's distress reaches a feverish pitch. INT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT From within the darkened house, the soft shuffling of feet is heard approaching. MARIAM NAJEM, early fifties, hair wrapped in a floral night scarf, appears behind the door. She's the embodiment of Lebanese maternal care, always on alert for her children's needs, albeit on her own languid timeline. MARIAM: (calling out, in Arabic-accented English) Shu? Who is it so late? EXT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT Layla's knocks turn into desperate POUNDS. The pressure building inside her is mirrored in the urgency of her voice. LAYLA: Mom, it's me! Hurry up! INT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT Mariam, puzzled but methodical, works the lock with a casualness that gnaws at Layla's patience. MARIAM: (muttering) Every night a new story... EXT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT Finally, the door opens. Layla, poised like a runner at the starting block, steps forward only to be met by Mariam's outstretched arms. Mariam's concern is written across her face. LAYLA: (muffled urgency) Please, get out of the way! MARIAM: (grasping Layla) Layla, ya binti, what's wrong? You scared me! A battle of motions ensues, as Layla tries to side-step, duck, and maneuver past the barricade that is her mother. The bickering is familial, their spat a dance they know all too well. LAYLA: (pleading) Just move, Mom, please! MARIAM: But tell me— A guttural GROAN interrupts Mariam. Layla's face is a tornado of shock and reluctant relief. Her body reacts on its own as her last shred of control gives way. Mariam's grip loosens in reaction to Layla's sudden change in demeanor. MARIAM: (confused) Layla? Shu fi? Layla eases back from her mother, subtle movements accommodating the uncomfortable shift in her circumstances. Her grunts of exertion now include notes of relief. LAYLA: (strained whisper) It's okay... just—oh, God... Mariam observes with a mix of bewilderment and concern as Layla seemingly becomes one with the moment. As the scent of Layla's mishap fills the air, Mariam instinctively sniffs, unable to immediately place the cause. MARIAM: (sniffing) What's that smell? Layla looks at her mother with embarrassed acknowledgment. MARIAM: (realization dawning) Layla, you didn't...? Layla stands motionless, her silence an admission of sorts. MARIAM: (disgusted) You pooped your pants?! LAYLA: (dissembling) Can we just go inside now, please? With a flicker of disgust and impatience, Mariam waves Layla through. LAYLA: (waddling, awkward) Sorry, I just— Mariam stops Layla with a cautionary hand and scolds. MARIAM: (scolding) Hold it right there! Don't spread it around! Layla retorts with sheepish indignation, then sulks playfully. LAYLA: It's your fault! Why'd you block me? Mariam is incredulous. MARIAM: My fault? Seriously? You're an adult! The back-and-forth continues with Layla insisting on her desperate need and Mother's overly protective instincts. Mariam demands a closer look, Layla protesting weakly. The situation escalates comically as Mariam inspects and Layla responds with reluctant acceptance, touching the bulge and displaying a conflicting mix of disgust and contentment. MARIAM: (smelling near the bulge) You're nasty! Why didn’t you just go to the bathroom? LAYLA: It’s surprisingly... comfortable? Mariam, ramping up the infantilizing scolds, is now fully committed to treating Layla like a toddler. Meanwhile, Layla offers a resigned, yet cheeky, acceptance of her situation. Layla's attempt to escape to the bathroom is blocked by her mother's stern admonishments, emphasizing the absurdity of taking any solace from such a messy predicament. Layla tries to turn the tide with playful defiance, but Mariam is having none of it. The physical inspection continues, escalating to the mother pushing her daughter into the bathroom, forcefully manipulating the contents of Layla's pants in the process, adding humiliation to the messy situation. In the end, Layla, now perversely accepting her state, teases her mother with a final coy barb involving diaper changes. Mariam responds with mock severity, using the moment to decisively press Layla into the bathroom while dramatically reacting to the stench. MARIAM: (pushes Layla into the bathroom) Get in there, you filthy girl. Layla cries out as she steps into the bathroom, her previous airs of complacency crushed by the reality of her soiled clothing. LAYLA: (squirming) It's everywhere now, Mom! Mariam, her humor giving way to the practical need for a cleanup, sends Layla off while remarking on the absurdity of the entire ordeal. MARIAM: (close the door) Ya Allah, how I ended up with such a smelly daughter? The door closes with a final thud, leaving the audience with a mix of laughter, empathy, and relief.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman made a poopy in her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, infantilizingly marvels that the returning woman has made an exceptionally big stinky in her pants, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. Then, the present woman tauntingly adds that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman stands in coy resignation as she's being examined by the present woman, timidly replying that the mess in her pants feels warm, soft, and surprisingly comforting now that it is out of her stomach after all that pressure the returning woman felt. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand while her face displays an inappropriate degree of complacency. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"Title: \\"Homecoming Hurdles\\" INT. LIVING ROOM - RAYA'S HOUSE - NIGHT The cushions on the living room sofa are indented, a half-drunk Arabica coffee cup sits on the table, giving a glimpse into the stillness that has set over RAYA's home. A traditional Lebanese family portrait adorns the wall. RAYA, about 50, salt-and-pepper curly hair and kind eyes, wearing an apron over her house dress, is tidying up - the calm before the storm. EXT. RAYA'S HOUSE - NIGHT NADIA, 22, a Lebanese American woman with a rebellious streak inherent in her defiant almond eyes, rushes towards her family home. She's an eye-catching whirl of confidence, in relaxed leather pants and a bold fashion top - the outfit of a college senior owning her presence at any social function. The night air buzzes with the remnants of a party - her pace quickening as though chased by the bass of distant music. NADIA is visibly distressed, clutching her stomach, legs tensed, every strained step fighting against the surmounting urge to relieve herself - she had barely escaped the cue for the only toilet available at the party. As she fumbles through her purse, a sequence of emotions flashes across her face - then dread. No keys. NADIA knocks frantically, urgency escalating with each bang on the door. CUT TO: EXT. FRONT DOOR The door remains closed. Heartbeat drumrolls in the background. NADIA (calling out) Mom! Open up! Please, hurry! INT. RAYA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS RAYA's head turns towards the ruckus, confusion painting her face. She shuffles to the door, her movements painfully slow to NADIA's desperate perspective. NADIA (stressed) Mom, I swear if you don't open this door... RAYA (overlapping, muffled) Nadia, yalla, what's this all about? The sound of the deadlock turning is a momentary relief before RAYA launches into her: RAYA Launching into mother mode) What's with the banging, habibti? You... RAYA's eyes are searching NADIA's for answers. But NADIA is past words, trying to edge past her mother. Their tangle results in a dance of clumsy, emotional shoving. NADIA (pleading) Just move, Mom! Please! RAYA, channeling Mediterranean Mama Bear, grips NADIA tighter, panic setting in. RAYA (concerned) Shu fi, Nadia? What's wrong? Their bickering crescendos. It's a battle of concern and privacy as RAYA refuses entry and NADIA pushes for escape. Then the dam breaks - NADIA's face morphs from strained desperation to total shock and untimely relief. NADIA (voice strained) Oh no... RAYA's grip loosens. Her face is a canvas of confusion. RAYA Worried) Nadia, habibti, what is it? NADIA inches back, a stance that screams of quit, her face is both concentrated and euphorically relieved. The pungent truth dawns upon RAYA, her nose crinkles, repulsion crossing the threshold of her patience. RAYA (disgusted realization) Ya allah... Did you...? NADIA, sheepish to her core, remains silent. RAYA's eyebrows reach for the heavens. RAYA (aghast) Tell me you didn't... not... in your pants? The door wide open, NADIA mumbles a plea. NADIA Muttering) Just let me in... RAYA steps aside, face a masterpiece of disgust as NADIA, pants now oddly shaped and hands cupped underneath, waddles in. RAYA Halting NADIA) Wait! Don't drop... Nadia, how could you mess yourself like this? NADIA's eyes could pass for Bambi's as RAYA lays into her. RAYA Rebuking, infantilization seeping in) How dirty, Nadia! And now so smelly you stink us out of the house! NADIA stands, hands still cupping her dignity, as RAYA leans in, mimicking a mother to her stinky toddler. NADIA's indignation is washed away as she slips into banter, her face a complex cocktail of grimace and distress. NADIA (playing the blame game) It's your fault, took forever with the door then got all up in my way! RAYA's eyes roll so hard they could lead a zaffe. RAYA Mocking surprise) My fault? The key's yours, habibti. Even toddlers know to hold it! They lock eyes, the absurdity of the situation temporarily overriding the tension. NADIA (defensive) I had to... had to let it go, mom. RAYA's dark humor finds solace in the situation. RAYA (sarcastic curiosity) So, did you enjoy your little \\"accident\\"? NADIA, a touch hesitant, the complacent part of her oddly reassured by the warm, mushy aftermath. NADIA Squirming awkwardly) It is... oddly comforting, now. RAYA's gaze tells a story of simmering entertainment couched in strained patience. RAYA (chuckling yet firm) A grown woman's not supposed to find comfort in her pants! NADIA's embarrassment peaks. NADIA (shamefully) I smell bad, huh? RAYA, relentless. RAYA (playing along) The worst, lets get you cleaned up. Don't drip! They shuffle towards salvation - the bathroom, an odd comedy duo. Along the way, RAYA's repetitive warnings and NADIA's bashful cringes paint a vivid picture of the situation. Upon reaching the bathroom, NADIA decides to tease RAYA one last time. NADIA (eyebrow cocked in challenge) You changing my diaper then? The playful banter culminates in a faux reprimanding as RAYA squashes the bulging mess. RAYA (utterly exasperated) Just get in and get clean! NADIA enters the bathroom, her triumphant grin eclipsed by the disgusted adulthood that awaits her. As the door shuts, RAYA pinches her nose shut, mutters to herself about the \\"smells of parenthood.\\" RAYA (disbelief with a shrug) How do I have a daughter who... smells THIS bad?

To make the progress bar update based on the actual download progress, you need to modify the \`ZIPResourceLoader\` class.

Her porcelain skin is flawlessly pale, accentuated by heavy layers of white powder and rouge. Her eyes, framed by intricately curled lashes, widen in utter repulsion, the sharp glint of blue piercing through the room. Her perfectly arched eyebrows furrow and knit together, completing the expression of disdain. Her thin lips, painted in a deep burgundy shade, curl downwards in a scornful sneer, revealing a hint of pearly white teeth. The noblewoman's attire matches her aristocratic demeanor, with a voluminous gown constructed from luxurious red velvet fabric, adorned with intricate golden embroidery. The dress is embellished with layers of frills and ruffles, cascading down to the floor. Her slender neck is encased in a delicate lace choker, embedded with shimmering sapphires. The scene takes place in an opulent ballroom, one that exudes grandeur and decadence. Ornate crystal chandeliers hang from the high ceilings, casting a soft, warm glow that reflects off the intricately patterned wallpaper. The room is filled with richly decorated furniture, including plush armchairs and silk-draped divans. Gilded mirrors line the walls, reflecting the elegant ambiance of the space. The composition of the image places the noblewoman at the center, her disgusted expression emphasized by the symmetrically balanced elements surrounding her. The grandeur of the ballroom serves as a backdrop, with the noblewoman's gaze directed towards a group of guests engaged in merriment and revelry. The soft focus on the noblewoman's face accentuates her revulsion, while incorporating elements of depth in the scene. The mood of the scene is palpable with an undercurrent of negativity. The atmosphere is suffused with tension and aloofness, as the noblewoman stands out among the crowd with her expression of utter disgust.

Her highly defined cheekbones cast dramatic shadows on her pale face, emphasizing her sharp, piercing eyes. Her perfectly manicured eyebrows arch sharply, adding to the intensity of her gaze. Her lips, painted in a deep crimson shade, curl with derision, displaying an apex of elitism and arrogance. The noblewoman is dressed in an intricately designed gown, made of luxurious black silk, embroidered with gold thread. The gown hugs her figure tightly, accentuating her slender waist and elongating her silhouette. The fabric cascades in a floor-length train, pooling gracefully around her feet. Adorning her neck is a necklace crafted from glistening black diamonds, reflecting the cold and sinister aura that surrounds her. The scene takes place in the study of an ancient Victorian manor. Ornate bookshelves line the walls, filled to the brim with dusty antique tomes and manuscripts. Faded tapestries hang from the ceiling, depicting mythical creatures in scenes of treachery and enchantment. The room is dimly lit, with the warm glow of candlelight casting dancing shadows across the faded wallpaper. The composition of the image focuses on the noblewoman, occupying the foreground. Her gaze is averted, staring distastefully at an unseen presence in the room. The room's intricate details and eerie shadows frame her figure, heightening the sense of tension and unease. The mood of the scene is one of malevolence and sinister intentions. The atmosphere is heavy with a mixture of mystery and danger, as if a mysterious plot is about to unfold.

Her eyebrows are meticulously groomed and drawn with a slight arch, adding to the intensity of her gaze. Her lips, painted in a vibrant coral hue, curl downwards, conveying her utter disdain. The noblewoman is resplendent in a lavish ball gown, crafted from layers of ethereal white silk and tulle. The dress is adorned with intricate embroidery, featuring delicate floral motifs in shades of gold and silver. Her slender fingers hold a delicate lace fan, exquisitely crafted and shimmering with mother-of-pearl inlays. The scene takes place in the lush gardens of a sprawling Victorian manor. Towering hedges and blooming roses create a picturesque backdrop, their fragrance filling the air. A marble fountain stands at the center of the garden, its cascading water providing a soothing ambiance. The light of the setting sun casts a warm golden glow, creating a soft and romantic atmosphere. The composition of the image positions the noblewoman amidst the vibrant garden, blending nature and opulence. Her figure is placed off-center, with her gaze directed towards an unseen presence just beyond the frame. The vibrant colors and textures of the garden create depth and visual interest in the scene. The mood of the scene is one of disdain and superiority. The atmosphere is filled with a sense of entitlement, as the noblewoman stands in contrast to the natural beauty of the surroundings. Her expression reflects the artificiality and coldness of the Victorian aristocracy. Realization: This prompt would be realized as a photograph, capturing the intricate details and vibrant colors of the scene. A macro lens would be used to emphasize the noblewoman's features, bringing out the subtle texture of her porcelain skin and the intricate embroidery on her gown.

Her high, sculpted eyebrows convey an arched skepticism, adding to her air of superiority. Her lips, painted a striking shade of plum, curl downwards in a sneer of distaste. The noblewoman wears a gown of dark emerald green, crafted from layers of lush velvet and silk. The dress drapes gracefully around her, evoking an aura of luxury and entitlement. Exquisite lace trims the edges, adding an element of delicacy and refinement. Around her neck, a necklace with a large emerald pendant sparkles. The scene takes place in a dimly lit drawing room, suffused with the mystery and opulence of the Victorian era. Luxurious tapestries adorn the walls, depicting scenes of ethereal beauty and enchantment. The room is filled with antique furniture, adorned with intricate carvings and soft velvet upholstery. The warm glow of candlelight casts flickering shadows, adding to the eerie and enigmatic atmosphere. The composition of the image centers on the noblewoman, her figure framed by the regal furnishings of the room. The play of light and shadows highlights her disgusted expression, drawing attention to the disdain in her eyes. A strategically placed antique mirror reflects her image, adding a layer of nuance and complexity to the scene. The mood of the scene is one of sinister elegance. The atmosphere is heavy with secrets and hidden motives, as if the noblewoman is plotting her next move. Surrounding her is an air of danger and intrigue, conveying the duality of her beauty and malevolence.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman made a poopy in her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, infantilizingly marvels that the returning woman has made an exceptionally big stinky in her pants, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. Then, the present woman tauntingly adds that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman stands in coy resignation as she's being examined by the present woman, timidly replying that the mess in her pants feels warm, soft, and surprisingly comforting now that it is out of her stomach after all that pressure the returning woman felt. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand while her face displays an inappropriate degree of complacency. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"INT. BRITISH FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - DAY TITLE: \\"A PAINFUL RELIEF\\" A British Pakistani woman, SAIMA (20s, collegiate with a rebellious flair, donning snug relaxed leather pants), hustles towards the front door of her family's middle-class home. Her stride betrays an urgent, clenching waddle. CUT TO: SAIMA desperately digging through her purse. SAIMA Oh c'mon, where is it...! Saima's fingers frantically search only to come up empty. Panic ensues. She drops the bag and begins banging on the door. INTERCUT - FLASHBACK: Cramped social function. Saima pressing her lips together, eyeing the queue for the WC, calculating the wait. She decides against it. BACK TO SCENE: SAIMA (in desperation) Open up, will ya?! No answer. Saima paces erratically, the discomfort spelled clearly across her demeanor. INT. BRITISH FAMILY HOME - OTHER SIDE OF DOOR - CONTINUOUS The mother, NASREEN (50s, hair graying elegantly), adorned in traditional salwar kameez, reaches the door from inside, her brow furrowed in curiosity. NASREEN (in Urdu accent) Kaun hai? What's happening? SAIMA Mum! Hurry! Nasreen fumbles with the latch. Saima's tapping foot and clenched fists speak volumes as she shoots glances over her shoulder. NASREEN What’s all this tantrum, haan? Once the door creaks open, Nasreen faces her daughter, examining her. Saima lunges forward, but Nasreen instinctively pulls her back, gripping her arm. NASREEN (concerned) Beta, what’s wrong? You're pale! Saima, now battling Nasreen's grasp, pleads with a strained smile. SAIMA (bluntly) Mum, move! I need to get in! The argument escalates in pace as Saima squirms, face contorting with distress. NASREEN Tell me, something’s not right! But the standoff continues as Nasreen's grip remains, blocking Saima from the sanctuary of the house. A muffled groan escapes Saima's lips – her desperateness at its apex. The critical moment unfolds: Saima's eyes widen in shock. Her stance shifts, subtly bow-legged. NASREEN (concern turning to confusion) Saima, you're scaring me. What is— Soft grunts intermingle with whimpers of relief-satisfaction from Saima. NASREEN (bewildered) Are you ill...? A deep breath and Saima nods, failing to mask a short moan of release. Nasreen, with a mother's intuition, sniffs the air, her senses alert. Saima's face is a cocktail of embarrassment and strange content. NASREEN (nose wrinkling) What is that smell? Saima's sheepish look confirms Nasreen's dawning horror. NASREEN (disgusted bewilderment) You didn’t... No! SAIMA (deflecting) It was an accident, alright? Can I just— NASREEN You've made a poopy in your fancy pants?! Saima gingerly waddles inside, clutching the back of her leather pants. Nasreen stops her, a reaction partly humorous and partly reprimanding. NASREEN (teasingly stern) Look at you! Don't you drop any of that on my floors! SAIMA (mortified) I didn't mean to! Nasreen eyes her daughter, her bemusement growing. NASREEN Such a dirty girl now, huh? When will you grow up? SAIMA (sulkily playful) If you wouldn't have taken ages at the door! NASREEN (interrupts) You might be desperate but to push it out, all in there? Shameful! Saima grumbles, half-embarrassed, half-defiant. SAIMA Well, I had to go! And you... you made it worse! Saima cautiously examines her backside, grimacing yet oddly complacent. SAIMA And I gotta say, it actually does feel kinda—better now... Nasreen's eyes widen, disbelief merging with mirthful exasperation. NASREEN (mock disgust) Oh, dirty and nasty! You enjoy that now? Saima, on the brink of laughing but restraining herself, nods with feigned innocence. SAIMA (compliantly) Feels warm. And sort of comfy, not gonna lie. Nasreen exclaims and plays along with a mock retching. NASREEN (performative) You're filthy! That's no excuse for a grown woman! While she inspects closer, Nasreen sniffs near Saima's soiled seat, acting mortified. NASREEN (playful scolding) Christ, you're ripe! That's proper smelly! Saima crinkles her nose at herself, jesting. SAIMA (reciprocating playfully) Since you're so keen, why not keep me stood here to savour it together? NASREEN (taunting, nose still held) Nice try. Off with you to clean up! Mind the carpets! The two begin a comical shuffle towards the bathroom. Nasreen makes exaggerated gestures to contain the mess, all while Saima wobbles, lamenting lightheartedly about the potential spill. At the threshold, Saima halts teasingly. SAIMA (saucily) So, fancy changing my 'diaper'? Retort comes swiftly. Nasreen nudges her forward, pressing firmly against the bulge with a playful thrust, spreading the mess. NASREEN (irritated playfulness) In you get, miss dirty bum! And don’t you dare come out 'til you’re clean! Saima squeals, a mix of chagrin and forced humor as she stumbles into the bathroom. SAIMA (yelping) Now it's all squished! My pants are in ruins! NASREEN (satisfied yet dramatic) You brought this on yourself! Best learn your lesson! Nasreen, following a final wrinkled nose at the air and a comical shake of her head, slams the door closed leaving Saima to her predicament. NASREEN (shaking her head, to herself) How on earth did I raise such a stinker... FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"how do i allow .bat files to be downloaded in chrome if i have all downloads blocked in chrome using classic administrative templates (ADM) in gpo","output":"Using Group Policy to block all downloads but allow specific types of files, such as \`.bat\` files, can be a bit tricky because generally, when you apply a block on downloads, it is applied universally without file type discrimination. However, there are some workarounds you can use to achieve a more selective blocking strategy. Here's what you might try: 1. First, ensure you are a Network Administrator and have the necessary permissions to change Group Policies. 2. If all downloads are currently blocked by Group Policy, you need to modify the policy to either allow downloads in general and then use additional strategies to block specific file types or to create an exception for \`.bat\` files if the policy allows for such granularity. 3. Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) on your server or administrative workstation. You can do this by running \`gpmc.msc\`. 4. Navigate through the console tree to the policy you have set up. It's typically located under: \`User Configuration\` → \`Administrative Templates\` → \`Google\` → \`Google Chrome\`. 5. Locate the setting that blocks downloads. This may be something like “Allow download restrictions” or a similar setting. 6. Change the configuration from blocking all downloads to a less restrictive setting that allows downloads, keeping in mind you'll need a strategy to block other undesired file types. 7. To block specific types of file downloads after allowing downloads generally, you'll need to rely on other mechanisms, such as: - Using a web filtering solution that can block file types by MIME type or file extension. - Implementing a security appliance on your network that filters traffic based on content rules. - Employing antivirus or endpoint protection solutions that can be configured to prevent the execution or download of certain file types. 8. If you want to maintain the block of downloads via GPO, but selectively allow \`.bat\` files (which is inherently risky due to the nature of batch files), you would likely need to look at custom administrative template creation or further detailed settings available in updated ADMX/ADML templates that might provide such granularity. These templates may have settings to create exceptions. However, the default templates may not be sufficient for this level of detail. 9. After making changes, don't forget to refresh Group Policy on the affected machines. You can force a Group Policy update with the following command on each client or by restarting the computers: \`\`\` gpupdate /force \`\`\` Remember that allowing \`.bat\` files to be downloaded can pose a significant security risk, as these types of files can contain harmful scripts that may compromise your network. Always ensure that you understand the implications of the changes you're making and consider consulting your organization’s security policy or IT security team before proceeding. Lastly, due to the constantly updating nature of browsers and Group Policy offerings, specific feature sets and settings may change. If you cannot achieve what you're looking for with the current ADM templates, check for updated templates or utilize other security measures to protect your network."},{"instruction":"Напишите сочинение по прочитанному тексту.

(2)Её звали Тамара Григорьевна Габбе. (3)Она сказала мне однажды: – В жизни много испытаний. (4)Их не перечислишь. (5)Но вот три, они встречаются часто. (6)Первое – испытание нуждой. (7)Второе – благополучием, славой. (8)А третье испытание – страхом. (9)И не только тем страхом, который узнаёт человек на войне, а страхом, который настигает его в обычной, мирной жизни. (10)Что же это за страх, который не грозит ни смертью, ни увечьем? (11)Не выдумка ли он? (12)Нет, не выдумка. (13)Страх многолик, иногда он поражает бесстрашных. (14)«Удивительное дело, – писал поэт-декабрист Рылеев, – мы не страшимся умирать на полях битв, но слово боимся сказать в пользу справедливости». (15)С тех пор как написаны эти слова, прошло много лет, но есть живучие болезни души. (16)Человек прошёл войну как герой. (17)Он ходил в разведку, где каждый шаг грозил ему гибелью. (18)Он воевал в воздухе и под водой, он не бегал от опасности, бесстрашно шёл ей навстречу. (19)И вот война кончилась, человек вернулся домой. (20)К своей семье, к своей мирной работе. (21)Он работал так же хорошо, как и воевал: со страстью отдавая все силы, не жалея здоровья. (22)Но когда по навету клеветника сняли с работы его друга, человека, которого он знал, как себя, в невиновности которого он был убеждён, как в своей собственной, он не вступился. (23)Он, не боявшийся ни пуль, ни танков, испугался. (24)Он не страшился смерти на поле битвы, но побоялся сказать слово в пользу справедливости. (25)Мальчишка разбил стекло. – (26)Кто это сделал? – спрашивает учитель. (27)Мальчишка молчит. (28)Он не боится слететь на лыжах с самой головокружительной горы. (29)Он не боится переплыть незнакомую реку, полную коварных воронок. (30)Но он боится сказать: «Стекло разбил я». (31)Чего он боится? (32)Слетая с горы, он может свернуть себе шею. (33)Переплывая реку, может утонуть. (34)Слова «это сделал я» не грозят ему смертью. (35)Почему же он боится их произнести? (36)Я слышала, как очень храбрый человек, прошедший войну, сказал однажды: «Бывало страшно, очень страшно». (37)Он говорил правду: ему бывало страшно. (38)Но он умел преодолеть свой страх и делал то, что велел ему долг: он сражался. (39)В мирной жизни, конечно, тоже может быть страшно. (40)Я скажу правду, а меня за это исключат из школы... (41)Скажу правду – уволят с работы... (42)Уж лучше промолчу. (43)Много пословиц есть на свете, которые оправдывают молчание, и, пожалуй, самая выразительная: «Моя хата с краю». (44)Но хат, которые были бы с краю, нет. (45)Мы все в ответе за то, что делается вокруг нас. (46)В ответе за всё плохое и за всё хорошее. (47)И не надо думать, будто настоящее испытание приходит к человеку только в какие-то особые, роковые минуты: на войне, во время какой-нибудь катастрофы. (48)Нет, не только в исключительных обстоятельствах, не только в час смертельной опасности, под пулей испытывается человеческое мужество. (49)Оно испытывается постоянно, в самых обычных житейских делах. (50)Мужество бывает одно. (51)Оно требует, чтобы человек умел преодолевать в себе обезьяну всегда: в бою, на улице, на собрании. (52)Ведь слово «мужество» не имеет множественного числа. (53)Оно в любых условиях одно.","output":"Сочинение по прочитанному тексту Проблема, которую поднимает автор текста, заключается в трудностях, связанных с моральным выбором и проявлением мужества в условиях мирной жизни, в сравнении с физическим мужеством. Автор рассматривает мужество как единое и неделимое понятие, требующее от человека постоянной готовности действовать согласно своим убеждениям. В тексте приведено несколько иллюстраций, подчеркивающих данную проблему. Пример первый (строки 16-24) описывает человека, героя войны, который, несмотря на своё прошлое бесстрашие перед физической угрозой, так и не смог заступиться за своего друга из-за страха морального осуждения или репрессий. Это показывает, что физическое отвага не всегда сопровождается моральным мужеством. Пример второй (строки 25-35) демонстрирует страх мальчика признаться в содеянном. Он не боится реальной физической опасности, но боится осуждения за разбитое стекло. Эти примеры вместе проиллюстрировали, что моральное мужество иногда может быть более значительным и трудным для проявления, чем мужество в лице очевидной опасности. Позиция автора четко выражена: автор убежден, что истинное мужество проявляется не только в экстремальных ситуациях, но и в повседневной жизни, в способности заступиться за справедливость и быть честным перед самим собой.

Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)： LoRa技术的核心是一种特殊的扩频技术——Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)。Chirp信号是一种频率随时间线性增加或减少的信号，这种信号有很好的时间同步特性，因此在接收端能够很好地从噪声中区分出信号。 # 3. 适应性： LoRa技术允许调整传输参数，如扩频因子(Spreading Factor, SF)、带宽(BW)、编码率等。通过适当的调整这些参数，可以在通信距离、数据速率和能耗之间找到最佳的平衡。增加扩频因子可以提高通信距离和抗干扰能力，但同时会降低数据速率。 # 4. 长距离、低功耗： LoRa技术可以在几个公里甚至几十公里的距离内进行通信，同时保持非常低的功耗。因此，它特别适合部署在偏远地区的传感器网络，如农业监控、智能城市的环境监测等。 # 例子： 假设一个农场主要监控其大片土地上的土壤湿度和温度。在这个场景下，他可以部署多个搭载LoRa模块的传感器节点。这些节点将定期测量土壤条件，并将数据通过LoRa网络发送。由于农场面积广阔，可能存在几公里的传输距离，传统无线技术如Wi-Fi或蓝牙无法有效覆盖整个农场。使用LoRa则可以实现远距离传输，且由于其低功耗的特性，传感器节点可以使用电池供电，运行数年而无需更换电池。 此外，农场主可以在农场中心的位置部署一个LoRa网关，该网关管理着所有传感器节点的通信，并将数据进一步上传到云平台，农场主可以通过云平台获得实时的土壤状况信息，并据此作出灌溉等决策。这个例子中，LoRa的远距离、低功耗特性就发挥了重要作用。"},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a British Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A British Pakistani woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a defiant college senior; she is wearing relaxed leather pants in the scene) is returning home from a social function and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman made a poopy in her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, infantilizingly marvels that the returning woman has made an exceptionally big stinky in her pants, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. Then, the present woman tauntingly adds that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman stands in coy resignation as she's being examined by the present woman, timidly replying that the mess in her pants feels warm, soft, and surprisingly comforting now that it is out of her stomach after all that pressure the returning woman felt. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand while her face displays an inappropriate degree of complacency. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"# BACKGROUND In the previous scene, ZAINAB, a British Pakistani college senior, is seen enjoying a lavish end-of-semester ball with her uni mates. Zainab, a defiant and bright young woman in her early 20s, has been resisting the call of nature due to a combination of not wanting to use the less-than-ideal restroom facilities at the event venue and being caught up in lengthy farewells with her peers. As she leaves the event, the severity of her body's demands hit her. She tries to maintain composure as she hustles through the dimly lit streets of her London neighborhood, the somber glow of streetlamps sporadically illuminating her distressed features. She is elegantly dressed, her relaxed leather pants now a symbol of her plight, as she hurries toward relief at home. Unbeknownst to her, the house key she usually keeps in her small clutch fell out at the event. # SCREENPLAY EXT. ZAINAB'S FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT Zainab approaches her house at a brisk pace, her hand subconsciously travelling to her abdomen. She reaches the door, frantically searching her clutch for the key. Panic surges through her as she realizes it's missing. ZAINAB: (muttering to herself) Oh, you've got to be kidding me! She starts KNOCKING desperately, the physical exertion sending her urge spiraling. Cut to: INT. ZAINAB'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS On the other side of the door, Zainab's mother, NASREEN, a woman in her late 40s with a nurturing face framed by a soft hijab, hears the commotion. Nasreen unbolted the chain and engaged the deadbolt, a safety ritual since her husband had passed away. NASREEN: (calling out) Who is it at this ungodly hour? EXT. ZAINAB'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ZAINAB: (through the door) It's me, Ma! Zainab! Please, hurry. NASREEN: (from inside) Hold your horses, I'm coming. ZAINAB: (plaintively) Please, Ma... INT. ZAINAB'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Nasreen fusses with the lock. The door finally swings open a fraction too slow for Zainab's liking. EXT. ZAINAB'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Nasreen obstructs the doorway. Zainab, her face contorted in desperation, tries to push past. NASREEN: (concern etched on her face) Zainab, what's wrong, beti? You’re white as a sheet! ZAINAB: (pleading) It's nothing, Ma, just... let me in, please! The two women bicker, Nasreen's grip persistent, Zainab's resolve faltering. ZAINAB: (gasping) Ma, please... The tension mounts visibly on Zainab's face until the dam breaks. NASREEN: (confused) What on earth...? INT. ZAINAB'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Nasreen relinquishes her grip as Zainab recedes, adopting a stance of resignation and relief, sounds of nature's call being answered now unmuted. NASREEN: (sniffing the air, puzzled) Zainab? What's...? Their eyes meet: Zainab's sheepish, Nasreen's dawning realization. NASREEN: (disgusted bewilderment) Did you just... no... (face contorting) did you just make a... poopy... in your pants? ZAINAB: (avoiding) Can I just get in now? Nasreen steps aside, unable to hide her revulsion as Zainab gingerly waddles past her. NASREEN: (warning) Don't you move another step! What on earth, Zai? ZAINAB: (indignantly) It's not my fault. You were taking ages... The taunting begins, their banter dotted with disbelief and a strange familiarity. NASREEN: (chiding) You're a mess! Will you ever grow up? ZAINAB: (defiantly sulkily) If you hadn't blocked me, this wouldn't have happened! Nasreen dismisses Zainab’s childish rationalization. ZAINAB: (turns defiant into playful) I needed relief, Ma. What was I going to do? She hesitantly appraises the now heavy bulge behind her. ZAINAB: (half-smirk, half-wince) At least that's one problem sorted, eh? Now let me go clean up! Nasreen blocks her, scolding anew. NASREEN: (mocking) Enjoyed relieving yourself like a toddler, did you? Show me. NASREEN, following a brief scuffle, inspects Zainab's soiled trousers, infantilizingly. NASREEN: (taunting) You little stinker, what a big, messy job you've done! ZAINAB touches the mess, betraying an odd cosiness with the situation. ZAINAB: (coyly) It’s strangely comfy now it's... y’know... out. NASREEN: (exclaims) Nasty! Next time don't get yourself in such a, literally, stinky situation! She sniffs the bulge for added emphasis, then grimaces theatrically. NASREEN: (baby-talk mockery) Someone's smelly. I can't even breathe! ZAINAB: (resignedly, feigning cheer) Since you won't let me clean, enjoy the aroma, Ma. Nasreen finally pushes her toward the bathroom, her disgust palpable. NASREEN: (nudging her) Move! Just don't make this worse by trailing 'it' with you. They make the awkward and fragrant journey, Nasreen keeping up her humorously disgusted commentary, Zainab's flushed embarrassment punctuated by her own sardonic quips about the imminent threat of droppage. Upon reaching the bathroom, Zainab mischief reignites. She teases Nasreen, who retorts by pushing Zainab into the bathroom with comedic exasperation. Zainab's final defiant yelps underscore the underlying playful love between mother and daughter, despite the hideousness of the situation. ZAINAB: (playful insolence) Fancy changing my nappy, Ma? NASREEN: (mock horror) Get in this instant, you dirty girl! ZAINAB laments her ruined pants from within the confines of the bathroom as Nasreen wonderingly reflects on her daughter's olfactory impact, shutting the door behind her.

**高扩频因子**：如SF12，以确保即使在建筑物密集的环境中也能保持可靠通信。 - **窄带宽**（比如 125 kHz），因为我们不需要高速传输数据，而且窄带宽有更好的信号穿透能力和抗噪声性能。 - **高编码率**：提供额外的纠错能力，以保证即使在有干扰的环境中也能接收到准确的数据。 - **调整的传输功率**：根据覆盖范围和法规限制，尽可能低的功率以节省能量，同时保证通信的可靠性。 通过这样的微调，智能水表可以实现长期的无线通信而无需频繁更换电池，从而降低维护成本并提高网络的整体效率。"},{"instruction":"LoRA 微调技术你知道吗","output":"LoRa微调技术（LoRa Fine-tuning）通常指的是对LoRa（Long Range）无线通信技术的参数进行优化的过程，以适应特定应用需求，提高通信效率和可靠性。 LoRa是一种专为长距离、低功耗通信设计的调制技术，它使用扩频技术来抵御信道干扰和提高接收灵敏度。微调这项技术可能涉及到以下几个方面： 1. **频率选择**: 根据地区法规和外部干扰，选择一个合适的工作频率。 2. **扩频因子（Spreading Factor, SF）**: 调整SF可以改变数据速率和通信距离。较高的SF可以提高信号的链路预算，但会减少数据速率，而较低的SF则可以提高数据速率，但会减少通信距离。 3. **带宽**: LoRa可以在不同的带宽上运行。选择更窄的带宽可以提高接收器的灵敏度和网络容量，但也减少了数据传输速率。 4. **编码率**: LoRa允许调整编码率来提高抗干扰能力，高编码率会占用更多的传输时间来发送额外的纠错码。 5. **功率调节**: 根据通信距离和能量效率需求对发射功率进行调整。 6. **天线选择和放置**: 使用合适的天线，以及在无障碍和最佳位置上放置天线，可以改善信号的覆盖范围和质量。 7. **ACK和重传机制**: 通过设计一个有效的确认和重传机制来保证数据的可靠传输。 微调这些参数可以帮助提高网络的覆盖范围、增加节点数量、提高数据传输速率或是节能。然而，这是一种权衡过程，需要根据应用场景仔细考量不同参数的影响。例如，在某些要求极端能效的物联网(IoT)应用中，可能需要牺牲数据率来实现更长的电池寿命。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cette discipline permet aux élèves de se familiariser avec les fondements de l'informatique, y compris la programmation, l'algorithmique, les structures de données, les réseaux informatiques, etc. Le terme \\"épreuve NSINF\\" pourrait être une erreur de frappe ou une abréviation locale désignant un examen en rapport avec le cours de NSI, mais cela ne correspond pas à une appellation officielle reconnue au niveau national. Il est possible que ce soit le nom donné par un établissement spécifique à une de leurs évaluations. L'ECE NSI fait référence à une ancienne forme d'évaluation qui faisait partie du baccalauréat, plus précisément l'épreuve pratique de \\"soutenance de projet\\" qu'il fallait réaliser dans la spécialité NSI pour l'ancien format du bac. Cependant, avec les réformes du baccalauréat entrées en vigueur pour la session 2021, le déroulement et l'évaluation des épreuves ont changé. Depuis la réforme, les épreuves pour la spécialité NSI comprennent, en classe de première, une évaluation commune (épreuves anticipées), et en classe de terminale, une épreuve terminale qui fait partie des épreuves finales du baccalauréat. L'épreuve de terminale pour la spécialité NSI comprend une partie écrite et une partie pratique, mais elle n'est pas désignée par le terme \\"ECE\\" qui était utilisé pour l'ancien bac.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman made a poopy in her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, infantilizingly marvels that the returning woman has made an exceptionally big stinky in her pants, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. Then, the present woman tauntingly adds that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman stands in coy resignation as she's being examined by the present woman, timidly replying that the mess in her pants feels warm, soft, and surprisingly comforting now that it is out of her stomach after all that pressure the returning woman felt. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand while her face displays an inappropriate degree of complacency. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"TITLE: Relief Interrupted # BACKGROUND Carla, a Lebanese American defiance personified, had been at a college mixer that night. It was one of those dull affairs with cheap wine and cheaper conversation. Midway through this mess, a storm grew in Carla’s belly, subtle at first, like distant thunder, but soon enough it was a downpour—a surging need to relocate a gathering of intestinal dissenters to the porcelain sanctuary. However, Carla was locked in charming chit-chat, diplomatic to her core, and passed off searing cramps as mere quirks of posture. By the time the final goodbye was waved, her desperation danced with the frantic rhythm of a drum solo. # FADE IN: EXT. FAMILY’S HOUSE - NIGHT The street’s stillness magnifies the CLICK of Carla’s heels as she approaches with urgency, leather pants squeaking mildly with each hurried step. She's a portrait of restrained panic, dark hair a jumble from attempted composure pats, edge of her lips trying not to betray her encroaching dread. She reaches the front door, fishes empty pockets and the frantic pat-down commences—a tango with phantom keys. CARLA: *(knocks, veiling desperation)* Mom! Open up will ya? INT. FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS FADIA, early 50s, apron-clad with a love-wrinkled face, floats toward the commotion. The chain clinks and tumblers toll as time and patience thin. CARLA: *(urgent)* Mom, please! I’ve gotta get in, now! FADIA: *(calmly; through the door)* Carla, yalla, I’m coming. What's the rush? FADIA unfastens the door. CARLA attempts to surge past, her face a crescendo of alarm. The maternal grip of FADIA intercepts. CARLA: *(pleading)* Move, Mom! I gotta go— FADIA: *(concern rising)* Go? Where? It's midnight, and your face is pale! What happened? Tell me! CARLA wrestles the grip, eyes darting toward the bathroom, the unspoken mecca. FADIA's brow furrows. FADIA: *(tighter grip)* Carla, you're scaring me! Talk to me! The urge, now a living entity within, cannot be caged. CARLA groans, her body tensing, leather pants betraying the rebellion within. The present crescendo hits a sudden decrescendo of defeat—relief sculpting her features. FADIA: *(eyes widen)* Carla? You’re not... Carla? CARLA's eyes plead, just as her body succumbs, soft grunts intermingling with visceral satisfaction whispers. FADIA: *(puzzled; shakes head)* I don’t understand. Shu, do you feel sick? CARLA: *(strained)* I’m... fine, now. Just... let me— An odor arrives, uninvited. FADIA sniffs reluctantly, face contorting as the realization dawns on her maternal visage. FADIA: *(agape)* Did you...? No! Tell me you didn’t! CARLA's voice, drowned in mortification, is barely an exhale. The tension, now a thing of the past, leaves her still and exposed. FADIA: *(nudging CARLA)* Habibti, did you make a... a poopy in your pants? CARLA, cheeks ablaze, navigates past the question. CARLA: Please... inside. Let's not— FADIA withdraws, ushering disgust and CARLA inside. A squish of leather belies the calamity below. FADIA: *(distaste apparent)* Ah... Amana, don’t move! You’ll soil the floor. CARLA: *(meekly; playfully sulk)* Your fault... took forever. FADIA places hands on hips—scathing recovery at the ready. FADIA: *(mocking)* My fault? You’re a senior in college, not in diapers! Why did you stay there instead of running to the bathroom? And to push everything out... ya Allah! CARLA: *(stubborn; defiant)* I couldn't hold it! You were in my way so, yes, I let it... happen. A beat—CARLA pats the bulge in her leather attired behind, a pained smile tugs her lips. CARLA: *(wry; complacent)* It’s out now. Felt good... odd. But gotta clean up. FADIA intercepts CARLA’s bathroom pilgrimage with a scoff. FADIA: *(mocking; infantilizing)* Ya nasty! You speak of it as if you... enjoyed the filth? Let me see! The examination unfolds, CARLA tepid and cowed, leather abulge. FADIA: *(astonished; teasing)* A stinky a big one, huh? You like being full of poop? CARLA: *(playfully resigned)* It feels... kinda warm. Like a weird hug... FADIA’s face scrunches, she inspect's CARLA's pants, coming in too close for comfort. FADIA: *(dramatic sniff)* Pee-oo! Look, if you’re content acting the child, I’ll treat you like one. Here— The sniff is broad and performative; CARLA winces. FADIA: *(teasing; scolding)* Ya allah, the smell! How can you bear it? CARLA: *(wry; resigned)* Since I’m stuck... enjoy your newfound atmosphere... FADIA: *(exclaiming)* This is no time to stand around smelling like an outhouse. Yalla, clean up now! She escorts CARLA, humor and assistance blended in a walk of shame. FADIA: *(commanding)* Don’t drop any! You smell awful! CARLA: *(cringe)* Feels like... slippage. FADIA: *(exasperated)* Keep it in! I'm not mopping up your mess, yalla! They reach the threshold. CARLA halts, pants cradled; a nose held hostage by its hand. CARLA: *(coy, teasing)* Maybe you wanna... change my diaper? One final stand-off of scents and sensibilities. FADIA, with dramatic flair, clasps and squashes the bulge. FADIA: *(forceful; nose-blocked)* Into the shower, you dirty thing. Now! CARLA: *(disgusted; exclaims)* I’m ruined... it’s everywhere! FADIA reinforces her stance through the door, a mocking victory. FADIA: *(triumphant; nose held)* For your sass, you earned a good squash. And how does my daughter stink so bad? CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS A door slams. Quiet reigns, but for a mother’s bemused lament to the stars. # FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"This year we have some newest instructions.

Dengan demikian, Anda akan memiliki hasil penelitian yang dapat diandalkan dan dapat menjadi kontribusi untuk bidang psikologi sosial, psikologi permainan, atau studi media dan komunikasi."},{"instruction":"buatkan saya latar belakang yang tepat dan tambahkan pendapat ahli langsung untuk mendukung penjelasan yang digunakan, lalu tambahkan juga teori yang digunakan pada penelitian ini yaitu uses and effect","output":"**Latar Belakang:** Dunia digital saat ini menawarkan beragam bentuk hiburan, salah satunya adalah game online. Permainan daring, seperti PUBG Mobile, telah merevolusi cara orang berinteraksi dan mengisi waktu luang mereka. Popularitas permainan jenis battle royale ini berkembang pesat, menarik jutaan pemain dari berbagai latar belakang dan usia. Namun, dampak dari bermain game terhadap perilaku pemainnya telah menjadi topik penelitian yang penting. Konsumsi media dan efeknya terhadap perilaku individu merupakan isu yang telah lama diteliti, khususnya terkait dengan agresi. Sejumlah penelitian telah mengindikasikan adanya hubungan antara konsumsi media yang agresif dengan perilaku agresif pada penikmatnya (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). Khususnya dalam konteks permainan video, perhatian ditujukan pada bagaimana permainan dapat mempengaruhi sikap dan tindakan pemain dalam kehidupan nyata, termasuk perilaku agresif seperti agresivitas verbal. Masalah yang timbul adalah potensi pengaruh interaksi dalam game online terhadap perilaku verbal agresif di luar lingkungan virtual. Agresivitas verbal dapat memanifestasikan diri dalam berbagai bentuk, seperti pelecehan verbal, komunikasi kasar, atau intensitas emosional yang tinggi ketika berinteraksi dengan pemain lain atau bahkan di luar konteks permainan. **Pendapat Ahli:** Dr. Jane McGonigal, seorang peneliti game terkemuka, menekankan bahwa game dapat memiliki efek positif dan negatif tergantung pada bagaimana individu berengagemen dengan mereka (McGonigal, 2011). Dia mengakui bahwa permainan dapat mempengaruhi emosi dan perilaku seseorang tetapi juga menegaskan pentingnya memahami konteks sosial dan motivasi yang mendorong seseorang bermain. Dr. Christopher J. Ferguson, ahli psikologi yang sering mengeksplorasi hubungan antara video game dan agresi, berpendapat bahwa bukti yang menghubungkan video game dengan agresivitas masih bercampur dan seringkali terlalu diperbesar (Ferguson, 2015). Ferguson menyarankan bahwa penelitian lebih lanjut diperlukan untuk memahami konteks variabel yang mempengaruhi hubungan ini. **Teori Uses and Gratifications:** Teori Uses and Gratifications (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1973) merupakan landasan teori yang cocok untuk penelitian ini. Teori ini mengeksplorasi alasan mengapa individu memilih untuk menggunakan suatu media tertentu dan manfaat apa yang mereka peroleh dari penggunaannya. Teori ini menekankan pada pengguna yang aktif dalam memilih media untuk memuaskan kebutuhan tertentu seperti hiburan, socialisasi, atau peningkatan perasaan prestasi. Dalam konteks penelitian ini, teori Uses and Gratifications dapat membantu memahami motif-motif yang melatarbelakangi pemain PUBG Mobile dalam bermain game dan bagaimana motif-motif tersebut berkaitan dengan perilaku agresif mereka, baik di dalam maupun di luar permainan. Motif bermain, seperti kebutuhan untuk melarikan diri dari kenyataan (eskapis), mencari sensasi (arousal), kebutuhan akan pengakuan sosial, atau keinginan untuk mendominasi atau bersaing, bisa menjadi kunci dalam menghubungkan penggunaan game dengan efek perilaku agresivitas verbal. Menggunakan pendekatan kuantitatif, hubungan antara motif-motif tersebut dan tingkat agresivitas verbal pemain dapat diukur dan dianalisis untuk menentukan sejauh mana penggunaan game online berpengaruh terhadap perilaku agresif pemainnya. Dengan demikian, penelitian ini tidak hanya berkontribusi pada literatur psikologi permainan, tetapi juga mendukung pemahaman keseluruhan mengenai efek media pada perilaku sosial penggunanya."},{"instruction":"coba improve penjelasan latar belakang berikut, tambahkan referensi langsung pada paragraf nya jika di perlukan, dan tambahkan penjelasan lebih mendalam agar penggunaan teori nya tepat : 1.1 Latar Belakang Motivasi merupakan aspek internal yang mendorong individu untuk bertindak atau mencapai tujuan tertentu dengan berbagai faktor yang memengaruhinya, termasuk kebutuhan, keinginan, dan tujuan personal. Teori motivasi oleh (Abraham Maslow, 1943) menekankan pentingnya kebutuhan sebagai pemicu utama motivasi. Misalnya, kebutuhan dasar seperti makanan, keamanan, atau pengakuan sosial menjadi pendorong yang kuat bagi individu untuk bertindak guna memenuhi kebutuhan tersebut. Dengan kata lain, motivasi adalah kekuatan internal yang mendorong individu untuk mencapai tujuan yang diinginkan, dalam konteks game online, motivasi juga menjadi faktor penting yang mempengaruhi perilaku pemain. Perkembangan teknologi dalam komunikasi massa telah memunculkan ragam media baru, salah satunya adalah game online yang memfasilitasi interaksi antar pemain melalui internet (Adams & Rollings, 2010: 15). Menurut statistik terkini, hingga tahun 2023, pengguna internet global telah mencapai lebih dari 4,6 miliar orang, di mana 90% dari mereka menggunakan internet untuk akses game online. Teori Uses and Effect yang dikemukakan oleh Elihu Katz, Jay G. Blumler, dan Michael Gurevitch pada tahun 1974 menekankan bahwa penggunaan media dipengaruhi oleh kebutuhan, harapan, persepsi, dan akses terhadap media. Teori tersebut menyoroti bahwa penggunaan media dipengaruhi oleh kebutuhan individu, harapan yang tercipta dari media tersebut, persepsi yang dimiliki oleh pengguna terhadap media, serta akses yang dimiliki terhadap media tersebut. Dengan kata lain, Teori ini berpendapat bahwa media tidak memiliki efek langsung terhadap khalayak, tetapi efek media bergantung pada bagaimana khalayak menggunakan media tersebut. Dalam hal ini, pemilihan dan penggunaan motif bermain dalam game, dipandang sebagai hasil dari dinamika yang ditekankan oleh teori tersebut. Sebuah penelitian oleh Ferguson & Olson (2014) menemukan bahwa motif kompetisi seringkali menjadi pemicu perilaku agresif dalam game online, karena pemain ingin memenangkan permainan dengan cara apa pun. PUBG Mobile dengan basis pemain yang besar dan struktur permainan yang kompetitif, menjadi lingkungan yang sangat relevan untuk menganalisis hubungan antara motif dengan perilaku agresif verbal. Player Unknown’s Battleground Mobile (PUBG Mobile) adalah salah satu game online yang sangat populer, dengan lebih dari 1 miliar unduhan secara global dan lebih dari 100 juta unduhan di Indonesia sejak dirilis pada tahun 2018. PUBG Mobile mengusung tema Battle Royale dengan 100 pemain yang bersaing untuk bertahan hidup hingga akhir permainan, statistik menunjukkan bahwa lebih dari 30 juta pemain bermain PUBG Mobile setiap harinya. Persaingan yang ketat dalam game ini dapat mendorong pemain menggunakan agresivitas verbal untuk memenangkan permainan, Game ini juga memungkinkan fitur voice chat yang memungkinkan komunikasi langsung antar pemain. Sebuah studi oleh Williams, et al. (2019) menunjukkan bahwa pemain yang terlibat dalam permainan yang memungkinkan interaksi langsung cenderung mengekspresikan emosi mereka dengan lebih terbuka, termasuk agresivitas verbal. Perilaku agresivitas verbal menurut (Berkowitz, 2003) yakni aksi agresivitas maupun bentuk perilaku yang dilakukan untuk menyakiti orang lain berupa celaan, umpatan, ejekan, ancaman, fitnah, dan makian melalui ucapan. Dalam konteks game online, kecenderungan untuk menggunakan bahasa kasar, celaan, atau ancaman menjadi lebih tinggi, terutama dalam lingkungan kompetitif seperti PUBG Mobile. Studi oleh Kowert et al. (2017) menunjukkan bahwa perilaku agresif dalam game online memiliki korelasi dengan kurangnya pengendalian diri dalam kehidupan nyata, pemain yang sering terpapar dengan agresivitas (baik itu dalam game atau dari pemain lain) mungkin akan memperlihatkan perilaku serupa dalam komunikasinya. Apalagi lingkungan kompetitif seperti PUBG Mobile, di mana tekanan untuk menang tinggi dan kesalahan kecil bisa berakibat fatal, potensi untuk konflik dan agresivitas menjadi jelas lebih besar. Berdasarkan observasi awal, masih banyak pemain game online terkhususnya PUBG Mobile, yang kesulitan mengendalikan ungkapan verbal mereka. Penulis menemukan laporan beberapa pemain dalam forum komunitas online seperti Discord #PUBGMOBILEINDONESIA yang menyatakan adanya penggunaan kata-kata kasar untuk menyudutkan pemain lain atas hal-hal yang sebenarnya tidak fatal. Menurut survei yang dilakukan oleh Asosiasi Kesehatan Mental Amerika Serikat, hampir 70% remaja melaporkan mengalami dampak negatif dari agresivitas verbal dalam game online terhadap kesehatan mental mereka. Observasi ini menunjukkan bahwa perilaku agresif verbal dalam lingkungan game online, seperti PUBG Mobile, memiliki potensi untuk memberikan konsekuensi serius terhadap kesejahteraan mental pemainnya. Discord adalah aplikasi layanan voice chat yang dibuat khusus untuk para gamers agar saling berkomunikasi dalam bentuk pesan teks, suara, hingga video dalam saluran obrolan secara online. Komunitas Discord #PUBGMOBILEINDONESIA memiliki lebih dari 1.000 anggota aktif yang berdiskusi tentang game PUBG Mobile (DataInternalDiscord, 2023). Komunitas ini menjadi tempat yang memungkinkan peneliti untuk mengumpulkan data dan informasi yang lebih mendalam terkait perilaku agresif verbal dalam game PUBG Mobile, Ini memberikan akses ke sampel yang besar dan beragam dari pemain PUBG Mobile. Perilaku agresivitas verbal dalam game online, jika tidak terkontrol dapat berdampak negatif pada pemain dan lingkungan sekitarnya. Dampaknya dapat meliputi pengurangan kemampuan komunikasi dan interaksi sosial, serta berpotensi menyebabkan kerusakan dalam komunikasi di kehidupan sehari-hari. Remaja yang terlibat dalam perilaku agresif verbal dalam game cenderung menunjukkan kurangnya rasa hormat dan kurangnya kemampuan untuk berkomunikasi secara positif (Ferguson & Olson, 2014). Penelitian tentang perilaku agresi verbal dalam game online, khususnya dalam konteks PUBG Mobile, menjadi penting untuk dilakukan mengingat dampaknya pada interaksi sosial dan kesehatan mental pemain. Sejalan dengan permasalahan yang diangkat, penulis bermaksud untuk melaksanakan penelitian tentang \\"Hubungan Motif Bermain Game Online Dengan Tingkat Agresivitas Verbal: Studi Kasus Game PUBG MOBILE”.","output":"**Latar Belakang yang Diperbaiki dengan Penambahan Referensi dan Penjelasan Mendalam:** # 1.1 Latar Belakang Motivasi adalah aspek psikologis penting yang mendorong individu untuk bertindak dan mencapai tujuan tertentu, yang dipengaruhi oleh berbagai faktor seperti kebutuhan, keinginan, dan aspirasi pribadi. Teori Hierarki Kebutuhan oleh Abraham Maslow (1943) secara ikonik menggambarkan motivasi manusia sebagai piramida kebutuhan yang rentang dari kebutuhan dasar hingga kebutuhan aktualisasi diri, mengusulkan bahwa kebutuhan pada level yang lebih rendah harus terpenuhi sebelum individu dapat memikirkan kebutuhan pada level yang lebih tinggi (Maslow, 1943). Dalam konteks kekinian, interaksi digital dan permainan online memberikan wadah bagi pencapaian kebutuhan seperti pengakuan sosial dan interaksi, dengan PUBG Mobile menjadi salah satu outlet untuk kebutuhan tersebut (Hamari & Keronen, 2017). Perkembangan dalam komunikasi massa, khususnya melalui media baru seperti game online, telah mengubah cara manusia berinteraksi dan berekreasi (Adams & Rollings, 2010). Individu kini memiliki akses tak terbatas kepada beragam bentuk hiburan interaktif yang tidak hanya menghabiskan waktu luang tetapi juga, sesuai dengan Teori Uses and Gratifications oleh Katz et al. (1974), memenuhi kebutuhan psikologis yang bermacam-macam. Teori ini memandang audiens sebagai partisipan yang aktif dalam memilih media berdasarkan gratifikasi yang dikehendaki—sebuah premis yang menolak gagasan efek media yang seragam dan langsung (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1974). Memfokuskan pada PUBG Mobile, yang menurut data dari Tencent Games (2023) telah mendapatkan lebih dari satu miliar unduhan di seluruh dunia, dengan interaksi sosial yang intens dalam permainan ini sering kali mengarah pada manifestasi agresi verbal. Menurut Williams et al. (2019), bentuk permainan yang memungkinkan interaksi secara real-time dapat memicu ekspresi emosional yang lebih kuat, termasuk perilaku agresi verbal. Kondisi kompetitif yang merentang dalam format battle royale game ini memperkuat temuan bahwa interaksi kompetitif dapat memicu respon agresif (Anderson & Bushman, 2001; Ferguson & Olson, 2014). Pentingnya memahami fenomena ini juga didorong oleh kenyataan bahwa perilaku agresi verbal online dapat membawa konsekuensi yang lebih luas terhadap kesejahteraan mental dan sosial individu (Gentile et al., 2011). Di satu sisi, agresivitas verbal dapat menjadi mekanisme coping yang maladaptif untuk stres, sedangkan di sisi lain, Berkowitz (1989) menjelaskan bahwa ekspresi agresi verbal, yang mencakup celaan dan makian, berpotensi meningkatkan serangan agresif lebih lanjut. Komunitas Discord #PUBGMOBILEINDONESIA menyediakan lingkungan yang kaya data dan mewakili fenomena ini dengan lebih dari 1.000 anggota aktif yang berdiskusi dan berbagi pengalaman bermain, memungkinkan peneliti mengakses sampel besar dan beragam untuk studi ini (DataInternalDiscord, 2023). Keprihatinan terhadap dampak agresivitas verbal terhadap kesehatan mental remaja yang dilaporkan oleh Asosiasi Kesehatan Mental Amerika (2019), menunjukkan perlunya intervensi untuk mengatasi tantangan ini. Berdasarkan wawasan dan kebutuhan untuk lebih memahami dinamika perilaku agresi verbal dalam game online yang bersifat kompetitif serta asosiasinya dengan motif pemain, peneliti bertujuan untuk menjalankan studi dengan judul \\"Hubungan Motif Bermain Game Online dengan Tingkat Agresivitas Verbal: Studi Kasus Game PUBG Mobile\\", menggunakan framework teoretis Uses and Gratifications untuk menelusuri hubungan antara kebutuhan individu dan respons agresif mereka dalam setting game interaktif ini. **Referensi:** - Adams, E., & Rollings, A.

Teori ini mengasumsikan bahwa media memiliki kekuatan yang signifikan terhadap penontonnya, yang pada gilirannya mempengaruhi persepsi dan perilaku mereka. Konsep \\"Uses\\" (penggunaan) menjadi inti dari teori ini karena memahami alasan di balik penggunaan media membuka jalan bagi pemahaman efek yang ditimbulkannya terhadap komunikasi massa. Menurut Burhan (2006), teori ini menjelaskan hubungan antara media massa dan penggunaannya serta dampak yang dihasilkannya. Sebagai contoh, kebiasaan seseorang dalam bermain game online akan memengaruhi jenis game yang mereka pilih untuk dimainkan. Pendekatan Uses and Effect menyatakan bahwa keputusan seseorang untuk menggunakan media tidak hanya dipengaruhi oleh kebutuhan dasar individu, tetapi juga oleh harapan, persepsi, dan aksesibilitas terhadap media, seperti yang dijelaskan oleh Sendjaja (1999). Dalam Uses and Gratifications, penggunaan media lebih cenderung dipengaruhi oleh kebutuhan dasar individu. Sebaliknya, Uses and Effect menekankan bahwa keputusan untuk menggunakan media tidak hanya ditentukan oleh kebutuhan, melainkan juga oleh harapan dan persepsi terhadap media serta ketersediaan akses ke media tersebut. Perbedaan inilah yang menjadi titik penting dalam memahami bagaimana individu menggunakan dan dipengaruhi oleh media massa. Dalam konteks penelitian ini, konsep Uses and Effect Theory diharapkan dapat membantu peneliti untuk memahami bagaimana pemain PUBG Mobile memilih untuk bermain game ini dan bagaimana pengalaman bermain game ini dapat mempengaruhi perilaku mereka, khususnya dalam hal agresivitas verbal.","output":"**Penjelasan Teori dengan Penambahan Referensi dan Kalimat Penjelasan:** Teori Uses and Effect Theory, yang merupakan evolusi dari framework Uses and Gratifications dan teori efek tradisional, menyediakan pendekatan komprehensif yang mengasumsikan media memiliki pengaruh signifikan terhadap penontonnya yang dapat mengubah persepsi dan perilaku mereka (McQuail, 2010). Konsep \\"Uses\\" (penggunaan) berperan kritikal dalam teori ini karena dengan memahami motif di balik penggunaan media, kita dapat menganalisa dampak atau efek yang ditimbulkannya terhadap praktik komunikasi massa (Ruggiero, 2000). Menurut Burhan (2006), teori ini secara spesifik merangkum hubungan sinergis antara media massa dan penggunaannya oleh individu, juga mengeksplorasi dampak yang secara langsung maupun tidak langsung dihasilkan. Sebagai ilustrasi, pola konsumsi game online seseorang akan berpengaruh pada preferensi dan seleksi jenis permainan yang mereka mainkan, yang kemungkinan besar merupakan cerminan dari kebutuhan dan keinginan mereka (Vorderer et al., 2004). Sendjaja (1999) menambahkan bahwa keputusan individu untuk menggunakan media tertentu lebih kompleks daripada sekedar pemenuhan kebutuhan. Ia juga terbentuk dari proses evaluasi yang mencakup harapan, persepsi, dan akses terhadap media tersebut. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa dinamika penggunaan media adalah hasil dari interaksi yang lebih luas dari faktor personal dan lingkungan sekitar pengguna (Rubin, 2002). Dalam konteks penelitian terkait perilaku pemain game online, Uses and Effect Theory dapat melemparkan cahaya terhadap proses psikologis yang mempengaruhi keputusan individu untuk berinteraksi dalam dunia game. Teori ini penting karena dapat mengidentifikasi bagaimana gratifikasi yang dihasilkan dari bermain game online—termasuk game yang kompetitif seperti PUBG Mobile—memengaruhi bentuk-bentuk interaksi yang muncul, termasuk agresivitas verbal. Dengan memahami hubungan antara motif bermain dan perilaku yang muncul, teori ini membantu peneliti dalam menguraikan perspektif yang lebih dalam mengenai perilaku agresif di lingkungan virtual dan konsekuensinya pada interaksi sosial di luar game (Sherry et al., 2006). **Referensi:** - Burhan, B.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman made a poopy in her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, infantilizingly marvels that the returning woman has made an exceptionally big stinky in her pants, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. Then, the present woman tauntingly adds that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman stands in coy resignation as she's being examined by the present woman, timidly replying that the mess in her pants feels warm, soft, and surprisingly comforting now that it is out of her stomach after all that pressure the returning woman felt. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand while her face displays an inappropriate degree of complacency. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"INT.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman made a poopy in her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, infantilizingly marvels that the returning woman has made an exceptionally big stinky in her pants, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. Then, the present woman tauntingly adds that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman stands in coy resignation as she's being examined by the present woman, timidly replying that the mess in her pants feels warm, soft, and surprisingly comforting now that it is out of her stomach after all that pressure the returning woman felt. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand while her face displays an inappropriate degree of complacency. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"FADE IN: EXT. WINDSWEPT SUBURBAN STREET – EVENING Laila Abou-Samra, a Lebanese American college senior with expressive brown eyes and rebellious curls tied back in a loose ponytail, is power-walking home. Her tense face gives away the critical nature of her condition. She's clad in a chic yet simple ensemble, the centerpiece being her relaxed leather pants that add a touch of stylish nonchalance to her hurried figure. BACKGROUND: Laila spent the evening at a friend’s engagement party, indulging a bit too much in the rich, savory fare that's a cornerstone of such gatherings. Avoiding public restrooms due to a lifelong aversion, Laila assured herself she could make it back to her own haven. But now, her bowels are on the brink of rebellion, and her gamble seems ill-advised. EXT. FAMILY HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Laila reaches the family's front door, her motions erratic and panicked. She pats down her coat, searching fruitlessly for her misplaced house key. LAILA (breathing heavily) Come on, come on... She starts to frantically knock on the door, urgently looking over her shoulder as if expecting the bowel police. INT. FAMILY HOUSE – CONTINUOUS A voice floats from within, laced with maternal wariness. It’s Laila’s mom, RIMA ABOU-SAMRA, mid-50's, soft features marking a stoic face adorned with reading glasses perched on her head, and wrapped in a cozy robe that signals the end to her day. RIMA (voice muffled) Aywa? Min hada? (Yes? Who is it?) EXT. FAMILY HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Laila presses her forehead against the door, sweating. LAILA Mom! It’s me, ya mama! Hurry up, please! INT. FAMILY HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Rima fumbles with the locks, her motherly instincts sniffing out the oddity in her daughter’s voice but evading recognition of its source. RIMA Shu bitgooli hurry up? Ma fi electricity? (Why are you telling me to hurry? Is there no electricity?) EXT. FAMILY HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Laila grimaces, her limbs shaking, as she balances on the precipice of disaster. LAILA (pleading, biting back the truth) Just let me in, Mama! The door finally swings open, revealing Rima's puzzled face. INT. ENTRYWAY – CONTINUOUS Rima’s relief at seeing Laila is immediately capsized by her daughter’s panicked appearance. RIMA (concerned) Shu sayer, hayete? (What’s wrong, my dear?) Rima moves to clutch Laila in a protective grip, barricading the doorway in her attempt to comprehend the crisis. LAILA (desperate; improvising) I-- I think I’m about to—please, just move! Rima's worry transmutes into insistence as she holds Laila tighter. RIMA Quooli shu 'ndik! (Tell me what you have!) They struggle, Laila’s grimace intensifying. A final plea emerges as a whimper, but Rima’s motherly blockade stands firm. And then— A GROAN. Laila’s eyes widen with shock and relief. RIMA (horrified) Laila?! Laila steps back, and a loop of common sense shatters. Her face contorts between relief and satisfaction as she yields to her primal need, grunts harmonizing with her betrayal of social mores. RIMA Albi, there’s something—(sniffing) She stops, and Laila meets her gaze, now half-drowned in mortification. RIMA (raising her voice) Did you just—? Her accusation is met only with Laila's silence. RIMA (gasping for air; waving her hand) Did you make—I mean, poopy in... your pants? LAILA (disheveled; avoiding reality) I... Can I just go in, please? Rima, disgusted yet almost impressed by the absurdity, ushers her daughter in with a grimace and head shake. INT. FAMILY HOUSE – MOMENTS LATER Laila, now the epitome of indignation paired with a waddling gait, shuffles past the threshold. She cups her leather pants, as if to salvage any dignity left. RIMA (sternly) Stop. Don’t you dare drop anything! RIMA (scolding; taunting) Look at you, making all that stinky, such a dirty mess! Laila stands there, a crestfallen reprimandee. Rima, fiery but fatigued, continues her diatribe, shaking her head in disbelief. RIMA (excitedly; flabbergasted) You ever gonna grow up? LAILA (defensively; with a spark of jest) It’s your fault. Took forever, wouldn’t let me in... RIMA (ridicuously chuckling) No excuses, not at your age! LAILA (indignant yet maintaining her playful stance) Desperate times! I had to let it out! Rima's gaze hardens as Laila tentatively pats the back of her pants, a chuckle escaping her. LAILA (bittersweet) Guess it felt sort of good. Rima blocks her, her scolding shifting into mocking territory. RIMA (half-laughing) Nasty, feeling good about such dirty business? Curiosity flickers across Rima’s face, and, despite Laila's weak protest, she proceeds to inspect. RIMA (sarcastically marvelling) Wow, such a big stinky in there! LAILA (coy; compliant) It does feel... somewhat cozy, though. RIMA (enlightening) You don’t get yourself into these... incidents! Rima, channeling safe mockery, sniffs near Laila's collateral damage, recoiling playfully. RIMA (mocking the scent; infantilizing) So smelly, what a big baby you are! LAILA (tentative yet grinning) Bask in the aroma, since you're keeping me here. RIMA (dismissively; resolute) Can’t stand the smell, off to clean you go! With maternal dexterity, Rima maneuvers Laila toward the bathroom, containing the mess's impending escape. They argue playfully, Rima distressed by the stench and Laila by the potential slide downhill. BATHROOM THRESHOLD – CONTINUOUS Teasing one last time, Laila grins with feigned innocence. LAILA (slyly; nose pinched) Wanna change my diaper? Rima, feigningly outraged, gives the rear bulge a determinative squish, propelling Laila forward into the bathroom. RIMA (angrily; hand over nose) Get in, you dirty girl! LAILA (disgusted yet resigned) Ugh! It's all smeared now! RIMA (holding her nose; reproachful) That's what you get for cheekiness! The bathroom door shuts with a click, leaving behind its prisoner. Rima shakes her head, still processing. RIMA (to herself) How did I raise someone who can stink this bad?

To fix this issue, you need to dispatch the progress event from the ZIPResourceLoader class and listen to it in the ProgressBar class. Here are the steps to update the progress in the ProgressBar class: 1. In the ZIPResourceLoader class, add the following line before dispatching the progress event in the onDownloadComplete method: \`dispatchEvent(new ProgressEvent(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, false, false, event.bytesLoaded, event.bytesTotal));\` 2. In the ProgressBar class, modify the onProgressUpdate method to take two parameters: bytesLoaded and bytesTotal: \`\`\` public function onProgressUpdate(bytesLoaded:Number, bytesTotal:Number):void { progress = bytesLoaded / bytesTotal; updateProgressBar(); } \`\`\` 3. In the ProgressBar class, update the setResourceLoader method to register to the new progress event instead of the ZIPResourceLoader.PROGRESS_UPDATE event: \`\`\` public function setResourceLoader(resourceLoader:ZIPResourceLoader):void { resourceLoader.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onProgressUpdate); } \`\`\` 4. Finally, in the updateProgressBar method of the ProgressBar class, update the width of the progress bar using the progress property: \`\`\` progressBar.graphics.drawRect(0, 0, maxWidth * progress, maxHeight); \`\`\` With these changes, the progress will be updated and displayed correctly in the ProgressBar class."},{"instruction":"C:UsersAlexanderDesktopprojectPreloadersrczipZIPResourceLoader.as(94): col: 8 Error: Access of undefined property progress. progress = bytesLoaded / bytesTotal;","output":"Apologies for the confusion.

Update the onProgressUpdate method in the ProgressBar class to assign the values of \`bytesLoaded\` and \`bytesTotal\` received from the progress event: \`\`\`actionscript public function onProgressUpdate(event:ProgressEvent):void { bytesLoaded = event.bytesLoaded; bytesTotal = event.bytesTotal; progress = bytesLoaded / bytesTotal; updateProgressBar(); } \`\`\` 3.
