If the data is readily available and includes the distance of each touchdown that was scored, we can simply count the number of touchdowns that were scored from 20 yards out. However, if the data does not include this information, we will need to do some additional work. One option is to look at game film and review each touchdown scored to determine the distance. This process can be time-consuming, but it will provide an accurate count of the number of 20 yard touchdowns scored. Another option is to use statistics to estimate the number of 20 yard touchdowns. By looking at the average length of each touchdown scored, we can make an educated guess about how many touchdowns were scored from 20 yards out. For example, if the average length of a touchdown is 40 yards and there were 50 touchdowns scored, we can estimate that approximately 25 touchdowns were scored from 20 yards out. However, this estimation method is not as accurate as reviewing game film.

It was thought that such large geographic distances would maximize the genetic variation between the groups sampled in the analysis and thus maximize the probability of finding cluster patterns unique to each group. In light of the historically recent acceleration of human migration (and correspondingly, human gene flow) on a global scale, further studies were conducted to judge the degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified groups as well as geographically separated groups. One such study looked at a large multiethnic population in the United States, and detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly correlated with selfidentified race/ethnicity—as opposed to current residence—is the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S. population.

Think about witnesses.","output":"When it comes to conflict resolution, it's always best to take a proactive approach. However, there are some instances where it's better to step back and let someone else take the first move. This is especially true when it comes to physical altercations. Always allow your opponent to attack first. While it may seem counterintuitive, waiting for your opponent to make a move gives you the advantage. First, it allows you to assess their level of aggression and plan your response accordingly. Second, any witnesses who may be present will see that you did not instigate the altercation, potentially saving you from legal trouble. This is especially important to remember on school property, where laws and regulations are stricter. Not only can you face punishment from the school, but also legal consequences from the authorities. Avoid bringing anything to school that even looks like a weapon. This includes toys, replicas, or even items that could be used as makeshift weapons (like pencils or rulers). Most importantly, always consider the presence of witnesses. Even if you didn't start the altercation, if you respond aggressively in front of witnesses, it may be difficult to prove your innocence. By staying calm and allowing your opponent to make the first move, you're also demonstrating to any witnesses that you're in control of the situation. In conclusion, while it's important to take a proactive approach to conflict resolution, sometimes it's better to step back and wait for your opponent to attack first. Remembering this can prevent legal trouble, both on and off school property. Finally, always avoid bringing anything to school that could be mistaken for a weapon, and consider the presence of witnesses when responding to any altercation."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to how many federal district court judges are there in the united states??","output":"There are currently 677 federal district court judges in the United States."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Firstly, it's essential to avoid swallowing air, as this can lead to discomfort and bloating. Eating slowly, avoiding chewing gum and drinking from a straw can all help reduce the amount of air ingested. Good posture is also key to a healthy lifestyle. Sitting up straight can help relieve strain on the back and neck, preventing long-term problems. It's worth investing in a good quality chair and desk if you spend a lot of time sitting down. Getting enough sleep is also essential for good overall health. Adults should aim for between 7-9 hours of sleep per night, to allow the body and mind to rest and rejuvenate. Creating a regular sleep schedule and avoiding electronic devices before bedtime can also help improve sleep quality. Finding a fitness-positive support network can be hugely beneficial in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This could include joining a local gym or sports club, or simply finding a group of friends who enjoy outdoor activities or fitness classes. Encouragement and motivation from others can be a powerful tool in achieving fitness goals. Finally, starting to track your weight is a great way to stay on top of your health goals. Regular weigh-ins can help identify any changes or fluctuations, and can help you stay accountable to your fitness plan. It's also useful to keep track of other health markers such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, to ensure overall health is maintained.

Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anticyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C. By photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.

Research finds binge eating amounts to twice recommended daily intake. Majority 'fall in to trap' of thinking everything is free and 'gorge themselves' Day's calorie intake is enough fuel for tourist to run two marathons. NHS guidelines dictate the average man needs 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight, while the average women should consume 2,000.","output":"A recent study has found that holidaymakers on all-inclusive trips consume a staggering 5,756 calories on their first day alone. This amount of calorie intake is twice the recommended daily amount and is equivalent to the energy needed to run two marathons. The research indicates that the majority of individuals ‘fall into the trap’ of thinking that everything is free, leading them to binge eat and indulge in excessive amounts of food. It is an easy habit to fall into, particularly when holidaymakers are surrounded by all-you-can-eat buffets and unlimited drinks. While overindulging on holiday might seem harmless, it can have serious implications for long-term health. NHS guidelines dictate that the average man needs 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight, while the average woman should consume 2,000. Consuming almost three times this amount on a single day can lead to weight gain and an increase in health problems such as heart disease and diabetes. It is important to approach all-inclusive trips with a balanced and measured approach to eating. Holidaymakers should aim to enjoy themselves, but also be mindful of the potential dangers of overindulging. This could include limiting portion sizes, choosing healthier options, and avoiding drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. In conclusion, while the allure of all-inclusive trips can be tempting, it is important to approach them with caution. The research shows that binge eating on the first day can lead to excessive amounts of calorie intake and long-term health problems. By being mindful and making well-informed choices, holidaymakers can enjoy their trip without putting their health at risk."},{"instruction":"Solve this math problem Solve 39423 = 2635*n 13277 for n.","output":"First, we can isolate the variable n by adding 13277 to both sides: 39423 + 13277 = 2635n Simplifying the left side: 52700 = 2635n Finally, we can solve for n by dividing both sides by 2635: n = 52700/2635 = 20 Therefore, n = 20."},{"instruction":"the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? that delivers a surprising OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"positive"},{"instruction":"(1) It was built by architect Henry L.

To ensure your lilacs bloom to their fullest potential, it is essential to follow these three simple steps: water, fertilize, and prune. Firstly, be sure to keep your lilacs watered. Lilacs are typically drought-tolerant, but they still require regular watering to flourish. During periods of dry weather, make sure to water your lilacs thoroughly every 7 to 10 days. A thorough watering session typically entails soaking the roots until the soil around them is well-saturated. Doing so will promote healthy growth and help prevent wilting. Secondly, fertilize your lilacs in the spring. Fertilization is essential to providing your lilacs with the nutrients they need to thrive, and the best time to do this is in the spring before the growing season. You can use either an all-purpose fertilizer or a fertilizer specifically formulated for lilacs. Apply the fertilizer according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically every 6 to 8 weeks during the growing season. Lastly, prune your lilacs regularly. Pruning is essential to keep your lilacs healthy and to promote prolific blooms. The best time to prune your lilacs is after they bloom in late spring or early summer, as doing so will help prevent damage to next year's blooms. When pruning, remove any dead, diseased, or damaged wood, as well as any shoots or suckers that have grown from the base of the plant. Aim to thin the interior of the plant to allow more airflow and light to reach the center branches. In summary, proper care for your lilacs involves watering them regularly, fertilizing them in the spring, and pruning them regularly. By following these easy steps, you can enjoy beautiful and fragrant lilacs for years to come."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: 71st Academy Awards CATEGORY Best Original Screenplay; AWARD 71st Academy Awards; Bulworth; 71st Academy Awards RESULT Nominated","output":"\\"Bulworth was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 71st Academy Awards.\\""},{"instruction":"Question: What main road leads to the airport?

It is important that more people become aware of the dangers posed by opening a door without looking for cyclists that may be approaching from behind.

Fans eagerly await to see which team and which player will score the initial points. In some cases, the player who scores the opening points is remembered for years to come. However, determining who scored the first points of a game can sometimes be tricky. In the modern era of basketball, various outlets track player statistics and scores, making it easy to identify the first scorer. However, for games that took place decades ago, uncovering such information may require some detective work. In general, the identity of the first scorer depends on the game and the specific competition. For example, during an NBA game, the opening basket is typically announced by the team’s public address announcer, who will name the player and the scorer's method (e.g., a two-pointer or a three-pointer). The same goes for top-level college basketball games, where the opening basket is confirmed by the game officials and subsequently recorded in the official box score. For lower-level or less formal competitions, tracking the first scorer can be a bit more challenging. In many such situations, the scorer may not be recorded at all, or the record may be incomplete or inaccurate. In some cases, the scorer may not have been announced, and there may be no official record to consult. In conclusion, determining who scored the first points of a basketball game can vary depending on the competition and the available records. In general, in modern basketball games, the opening scorer is typically announced by the public address announcer or confirmed by game officials and subsequently recorded in the official box score.

The video was posted online after Ireland's win against the USA last Tuesday. However, the song has sparked controversy due to its ties to the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The song was written in honor of Joe McDonnell, a member of the Provisional IRA who died on hunger strike in 1981. The IRA is a paramilitary organization that has been involved in a decades-long armed struggle for the unification of Ireland. The song has lyrics that some have interpreted as glorifying violent revolution and calls to arms. Following the release of the video, Delaney faced condemnation from politicians and members of the public. However, he has since apologized for any offense caused by his singing of the song. In a statement, Delaney said, \\"I am not a violent person, and I apologize if anyone is offended by the song. It was a mistake to sing it, and I regret it.\\" The incident has once again raised questions about the role of politics and sport. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the use of sports events to make political statements or to highlight social issues. Many people argue that sports should be kept separate from politics, while others believe that sports can be a powerful tool for promoting social change. Regardless of where one stands on this debate, it is clear that Delaney's actions have caused offense to many. It is commendable that he has apologized for his mistake, and the incident serves as a reminder to all of us that our actions and words can have unintended consequences.

This tensor gives the rest mass for the entire system. Matter therefore is sometimes considered as anything that contributes to the energy–momentum of a system, that is, anything that is not purely gravity.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of an era and caused significant changes in the political landscape of the world. The sudden collapse of the Soviet Union caught many off guard, and its impact was felt across the globe. In the immediate aftermath of the dissolution, many former Soviet republics, including Armenia, had to adjust to the new realities of being independent states. Diplomatic relations between countries had to be established on a bilateral basis, and the establishment of embassies played a crucial role in this process. The opening of the embassy in Yerevan was an important milestone in the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Armenia and other countries. The embassy served as a symbol of the newly forged ties between Armenia and the international community, signaling a new era of cooperation and engagement. In the years since the opening of the embassy, Armenia has made significant strides in strengthening its diplomatic ties with other countries. Today, Armenia has embassies in over 30 countries and maintains diplomatic relations with over 160 countries around the world. In conclusion, approximately 16 months passed between the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the opening of the embassy in Yerevan.

Surplus killing represents a deviation from this type of behaviour. The treatment of consumption in terms of costbenefit analysis is known as optimal foraging theory, and has been quite successful in the study of animal behavior.

Whether it's because the topic is uncomfortable or we simply have other obligations to attend to, it's important to know how to gracefully excuse ourselves from a conversation. One way to do this is to simply be vague about the reason you need to leave. You can say something like, \\"Excuse me, I need to attend to something\\" or \\"I have some other business to attend to\\" without going into specifics about what that business is. This allows you to exit the conversation without making the other person feel uncomfortable or unimportant. Another option is to set clear boundaries from the start of the conversation. If you know that you have limited time to spare, you can politely let the other person know that you're only available for a short while. This gives them the opportunity to get to the point quickly and allows you to exit the conversation without feeling guilty. If you find yourself in a situation where you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, it's important to know how to call for help. Excusing yourself to make a phone call or to get help from someone nearby can help you to avoid a potentially dangerous situation.

One solution that has become increasingly popular is virtual dates. This may seem daunting at first, but with a little preparation, virtual dates can be just as enjoyable as in-person ones. The first step to a successful virtual date is to agree on a time and platform. This could be anything from Zoom to FaceTime, but it's important to make sure both parties are comfortable with the chosen platform. Once you've decided on a time and platform, treat the date like you would an in-person one. Get dressed up the way you normally would, and make sure to tidy up the space where you'll be chatting. It's also important to make sure your device is charged and plugged in before the date begins. There's nothing worse than a device dying halfway through a conversation. Once everything is set up, give your date your full attention. This means no multitasking or checking your phone. Treat the virtual date just as you would an in-person one in terms of attentiveness. If you want to share a meal, consider ordering take-out from the same restaurant so you can both enjoy the same type of cuisine. Alternatively, you could cook the same recipe separately and enjoy the meal together virtually. Sharing a meal can help create a sense of togetherness during the date. Another fun virtual date idea is to stream a movie together. There are several platforms available that allow you to watch a movie simultaneously, so you can still have that shared movie experience. You could also try an online workout class together, which is a fun and active way to bond. Lastly, playing an online game together can be a great way to break the ice and have some fun. Whether it's a trivia game or a multiplayer game, playing together can help bring out your competitive side and provide some laughs along the way. In summary, virtual dates require some preparation, but with a little creativity and effort, they can be just as fun and fulfilling as in-person dates. Agree on a time and platform, get dressed up, tidy up your space, give your date your full attention, consider sharing a meal, stream a movie or workout class, and play an online game together. These tips will help ensure a successful and enjoyable virtual date."},{"instruction":"What happens next? How to connect to your pc remotely in windows 8 Set up your router.

Enjoy!","output":"Age the brew—briefly! Enjoy! When it comes to brewing, time is an essential factor that can greatly influence the flavor of your beer, wine or other fermented beverages. Many homebrewers, especially those new to the hobby, believe that the longer you let your brew age, the better it will taste. While this may be true in some cases, it's not always the best approach. First of all, every type of beverage has its perfect aging window. For example, beer typically tastes best when consumed fresh, within a few weeks to a few months after bottling. On the other hand, wine usually needs to be aged for several months to even several years to develop its complex flavors and aromas. While aging can undoubtedly enhance the taste and aroma of your beverage, it's good to remember that it's not always a good thing. Over-aging can cause your brew to lose its carbonation, flavor, and aroma, leaving it flat and lifeless. Furthermore, not all beverages are suitable for aging, and some may spoil or turn sour if kept for too long. So, what's the best approach? The answer is to age your brew briefly but not for too long. This means that you should respect the aging window of your beverage and consume it while it's still at its peak. After that, the flavor and aroma may start to degrade. But how can you tell if your brew is still good or not? The simplest way is to taste it regularly as it ages. This way, you can monitor its flavor and aroma and learn when it's time to drink it. If you notice that the flavor and aroma are starting to degrade, it's time to consume it before it loses its freshness entirely. In conclusion, while aging your brew can enhance its flavor and aroma, over-aging can do more harm than good. Therefore, it's best to age your brew briefly within its optimal aging window and enjoy it while it's at its best. By doing so, you'll ensure that you get the most out of your brewing efforts and enjoy a delicious, refreshing beverage that's perfect for any occasion."},{"instruction":"Read this: Holes through a PCB are typically drilled with smalldiameter drill bits made of solid coated tungsten carbide.

The policy recommendation that President Trump approved flatly states that “transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service.” But it also largely gives the Pentagon the ability to make exceptions where it sees fit. The policy adopts recommendations that Mr. Trump received last month from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. It comes after court rulings froze the president’s initial ban on transgender troops — issued in July — as potentially unconstitutional. “In my professional judgment, these policies will place the Department of Defense in the strongest position to protect the American people, to fight and win America’s wars, and to ensure the survival and success of our service members around the world,” Mr. Mattis wrote in a summary of his recommendations to the president. ||||| This will appear next to all of your comments This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser |||||Summary","output":"White House approves policy allowing transgender troops to remain in the military, but the Pentagon could enforce serving according to their gender at birth.
