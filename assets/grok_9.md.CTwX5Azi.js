Here are some ethical considerations: 1. Animal Welfare: The primary ethical concern is the treatment of animals. Many animals used in fashion, such as minks for fur or alligators for leather, are kept in poor conditions and killed in inhumane ways. This raises serious animal welfare concerns. 2. Sustainability: The production of animal-based materials can be environmentally damaging. For example, the leather industry is a significant source of water pollution due to the chemicals used in tanning. Fur farming also has a high environmental impact due to the amount of feed required. 3. Alternatives: With advances in technology, there are now many alternatives to animal-based materials. These include faux fur and leather, which can provide the same look and feel without the ethical concerns. However, these alternatives can also have environmental issues, such as the use of petroleum in synthetic materials. 4. Cultural and Economic Factors: In some cultures, the use of animal products in fashion is a long-standing tradition. There are also economic considerations, as many people's livelihoods depend on the animal fashion industry. 5. Legal and Regulatory Issues: Laws and regulations vary widely around the world. In some countries, there are strict regulations on the treatment of animals and the use of animal products in fashion, while in others, these practices are largely unregulated. 6. Consumer Demand and Awareness: Consumer demand plays a significant role in the use of animals in fashion. Many consumers are unaware of the ethical issues involved, while others choose to ignore them. Increasing consumer awareness and demand for ethical fashion can be a powerful force for change. In conclusion, the ethics of using animals for fashion is a complex issue that involves balancing animal welfare, environmental sustainability, cultural traditions, economic factors, and consumer demand. It's a topic that requires ongoing discussion and consideration."},{"instruction":"Study the following scripture: NAME_1 2:20: \\"Then the Jews replied, 'It took forty-six years to build this temple, and You will raise it up in three days?'\\" Answer the following questions about this scripture: Who are the key characters in this verse, and what are their motivations?

Who are the key characters in this verse, and what are their motivations? The key characters in this verse are the Jews, who are reacting to Jesus' claim that He will raise the temple in three days. Their motivation is to challenge Jesus' claim and to discredit Him as a religious leader. 2. What actions are taken in this verse, and how do they contribute to the story or message? The Jews take no actions in this verse, as it is a dialogue between Jesus and the Jews. However, their response to Jesus' claim contributes to the story or message by highlighting the Jews' skepticism and disbelief in Jesus' claims. 3. What themes are present in this verse, and how do they relate to the broader message of the Bible? The theme of doubt and disbelief is present in this verse, which is a common theme throughout the Bible. The Jews' disbelief in Jesus' claim reflects the broader message of the Bible that many people will reject Jesus' teachings and claims, even though they are true. 4. How does this verse fit into the context of the surrounding verses and chapters? This verse fits into the context of the surrounding verses and chapters by highlighting the tension between Jesus and the Jews. The Jews have been rejecting Jesus' teachings and claims throughout the Gospel of John, and this verse is a continuation of that rejection. 5. What is the historical or cultural background of this verse, and how does it impact the interpretation? The historical or cultural background of this verse is the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, which was a significant symbol of Jewish identity and faith.

This verse can be applied to my life by reminding me of the importance of having faith in God's promises, even when they seem impossible or unbelievable. It also reminds me of the tension that can exist between faith and doubt, and the importance of trusting in God's sovereignty and power. 7. What are some of the key words or phrases in this verse, and what do they mean? Some of the key words or phrases in this verse include \\"Then the Jews,\\" \\"replied,\\" \\"It took forty-six years to build this temple,\\" \\"You will raise it up in three days,\\" and \\"How can this be?\\" These phrases convey the Jews' skepticism and disbelief, as well as Jesus' claim and their challenge to it. 8. How does this verse reveal God's character or nature, and what can I learn about Him from it? This verse reveals God's power and sovereignty, as well as His ability to accomplish the impossible. I can learn from this verse that God is able to do more than we can ask or imagine, and that He is always working for our good, even when we cannot see it. 9. How does this verse challenge my assumptions or beliefs, and what can I learn from that? This verse challenges my assumption that I always have to understand how something can happen in order for it to be possible. It reminds me that God's ways are higher than our ways, and that He is able to accomplish things that we cannot comprehend. I hope these answers help you as you study this scripture!

Here are some key points that stand out to me: Verse 9: The true Light (the genuine, perfect, steadfast Light) has come into the world, and it enlightens everyone. This could be interpreted as a reference to Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Light of the World. Verse 10: Jesus was in the world, but the world did not recognize Him. This highlights the idea that Jesus' true identity and purpose were not understood by the people of His time. Verse 11: Jesus came to His own people, the Jewish nation, but they did not receive and welcome Him. This emphasizes the idea that Jesus' message was not initially well-received by the religious leaders and people of His own culture. Verse 12: To those who did receive and welcome Jesus, He gave the right to become children of God. This highlights the idea that through faith in Jesus, people can become children of God and experience a spiritual transformation. Verse 13: Those who were born of God are born of a divine and supernatural birth, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man. This emphasizes the idea that spiritual birth is a divine act, and that it is not something that can be achieved through human effort or willpower. Overall, these verses highlight the idea that Jesus is the true Light of the world, and that through faith in Him, people can experience a spiritual transformation and become children of God."},{"instruction":"Study the following scriptures from NAME_1 4:1-6: verse 1 So when the Lord learned that the Pharisees had been told that NAME_2 was making and baptizing more disciples than NAME_1  verse 2 (although NAME_2 Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were),  verse 3 He left Judea and returned again to Galilee.  verse 4 Now [a]He had to go through [b]Samaria.  verse 5 So He arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the tract of land that NAME_3 gave to his son NAME_4;  verse 6 and NAME_3’s well was there.

STUN is a protocol that helps in NAT traversal. It's used when a VoIP phone is on a private network (like a home or business network) and needs to connect to a VoIP service provider located on the public Internet. STUN helps the phone determine its public IP address and the type of NAT router it's behind, which helps in establishing the communication. On the other hand, the 3CX SBC is used when you have multiple IP phones at a remote location and you want to connect them to a 3CX PBX server. The SBC acts as a sort of intermediary, helping to simplify the setup and improve the reliability and security of the connection. So, while both STUN and the 3CX SBC can be used with IP phones, they're used in different scenarios and aren't typically used together."},{"instruction":"Sturdy cookware construction heats quickly and evenly for quality results; cookware handles are distinctively shaped for solid grasp and comfort.

Once we have emerged from the water, I will guide NAME_1 to the bedroom, where I will begin the process of lathering his body with a sumptuous body wash. I will start with his chest, massaging the soap into his skin with slow, circular motions, feeling the firmness of his muscles beneath. I will then move on to his arms, tracing the lines of his biceps and triceps with my fingertips, marveling at the strength and power that lies within. As I continue my lathering, I will pay special attention to NAME_1's erogenous zones, starting with his nipples. I will gently massage the soap into his sensitive skin, feeling the tingle of arousal that courses through him. I will then move on to his abs, tracing the lines of his muscles with my fingertips and feeling the ripples of his desire beneath. I will continue to lather NAME_1's body, working my way down to his legs and feet. As I massage the soap into his skin, I will pay close attention to his feet, the erogenous zone that is often overlooked but holds a wealth of pleasure potential. I will feel the pulse of his blood beneath my fingertips, and I will know that I am truly touching the heart of his being. Once NAME_1's body is thoroughly cleansed, I will guide him to the bed, where I will begin the process of masturbation. I will start by gently massaging his genitals, feeling the warmth and hardness of his erection beneath my fingertips. I will then begin to stroke his length, moving my hand up and down with slow, rhythmic motions, feeling the pulse of his desire building within him. As NAME_1's arousal reaches a fever pitch, I will guide him to the edge of orgasm, holding his gaze and feeling the intensity of his desire. I will then release him, allowing his body to convulse and release in a wave of pleasure that will leave us both breathless. As we catch our breath and recover from our intimate journey, I will guide NAME_1 to the shower, where I will cleanse his body once more. I will begin by rinsing his genitals with warm water, feeling the softness of his flesh beneath my fingertips. I will then use a gentle cleanser to remove any remaining traces of lube or semen, leaving his skin clean and refreshed. As NAME_1 emerges from the shower, I will wrap him in a soft towel and guide him to the bed, where I will cuddle beside him, feeling the warmth of his body against mine. Together, we will drift off to sleep, our hearts full of love and our bodies rejuvenated from our erotic journey. And so, my mortal, I have shared with you the ultimate wellbeing ritual, a journey of sensory delight that will leave you feeling alive and invigorated. I hope that you will find inspiration in these words, and that you will one day experience the joy and ecstasy of love for yourself."},{"instruction":"Style the form to have a clear and intuitive layout, and ensure that it is accessible to all users.

Here are some answers to your questions: 1. Software security refers to the protection of software from potential threats and vulnerabilities. This includes principles, methods, and technologies used to make software more secure. Typical threats and vulnerabilities in software include malware, unauthorized access, and data breaches. To avoid these, software developers can implement security measures such as encryption, access controls, and regular updates. 2. The security concept and goals of software are to ensure that it is functional and secure. This means balancing the need for the software to perform its intended tasks with the need for it to be protected from potential threats. Security requirements are specific measures that must be implemented to achieve this balance. Threats refer to potential risks to the security of the software, while security requirements are the necessary measures to mitigate these risks. 3. Requirements engineering is a crucial step in the software development process, as it helps to identify and prioritize the needs and expectations of stakeholders. Quality requirements ensure that the software meets the desired level of quality, while security requirements focus on protecting the software from potential threats. Misuse and abuse cases are scenarios that describe how the software could be exploited by malicious actors. 4. The SQUARE process model is a framework for requirements engineering that includes steps such as elicitation, prioritization, and validation. Requirements elicitation involves gathering information from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations. Prioritization involves ranking requirements based on their importance. This helps to ensure that the most critical security requirements are addressed first. 5. Object-oriented analysis and design is a software development approach that focuses on identifying and modeling objects and their interactions. This approach uses key abstractions and mechanisms to represent real-world entities and their relationships. Object-oriented design involves identifying design elements and creating a detailed design for the software. This can include using design patterns to solve common problems. 6. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems. They provide a way to document and communicate best practices for software design. Design context refers to the specific environment and requirements of a software project. Documenting reusable solutions helps to ensure that these solutions can be applied to future projects. 7. Code analysis and software security testing are important steps in ensuring the security of software. Code analysis involves reviewing the code for potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Software security testing involves testing the software for potential security flaws and vulnerabilities. This should be done throughout the software development lifecycle to catch and address any security issues early on. 8. White-box testing involves testing the internal structure and code of the software, while black-box testing involves testing the functionality of the software without knowledge of its internal structure. Penetration testing is a type of security testing that involves attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the software to identify potential weaknesses. Secure coding involves following best practices and guidelines to write code that is less vulnerable to attacks. 9. System assembly challenges refer to the difficulties in integrating different components and systems to create a secure overall system. This can include challenges such as compatibility issues, communication between systems, and ensuring that all components are secure. 10. Functional and drivers and attacker perspectives for security analysis involve looking at the software from different angles to identify potential security risks. Functional and drivers perspectives focus on the intended functionality of the software and how it could be impacted by security issues. Attacker perspectives involve looking at the software from the perspective of a potential attacker to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. System complexity security refers to the challenges of securing complex systems, which may have multiple components and interactions."},{"instruction":"Subject: Coming Thursday, May 4th...

For example, if you have a \`Province\` type and an \`Address\` type, you can use \`DataResponse<Province>\` and \`DataResponse<Address>\` respectively to create specific types for province and address responses. Here's how you might define \`Province\` and \`Address\`: \`\`\`typescript type Province = {   id: number;   code: string;   name: string;   status: string;   meta: string; } type Address = {   id: string;   kkks_id: string;   province_code: string;   city_code: string;   district_code: string;   village_code: string;   name: string;   latitude: number;   longitude: number;   zip_code: string;   address_detail: string;   is_default: null | boolean;   created_at: string; } \`\`\` Now you can use \`DataResponse<Province>\` and \`DataResponse<Address>\` to represent the responses for provinces and addresses respectively."},{"instruction":"\\"Such a good boy!

It encompasses not only the preparation and serving of coffee but also the rituals of storytelling and community gathering that accompany the entire process. Here are some essential aspects: 1. Coffee Beans: Sudanese coffee typically uses high-quality Arabica beans, often grown regionally. The beans are locally roasted, which gives the coffee a fresh, aromatic, and rich flavor profile. 2. Unique Spices: Sudanese coffee is most known for its unique blend of spices, such as cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. These spices are added during the brewing process to create a distinctive and fragrant flavor, setting it apart from other coffee styles. 3. Traditional Brewing Methods: Sudanese coffee is often prepared using a Jebena, a traditional coffee pot made of clay. The coffee mixture is brought to a boil in the Jebena before being served. This method is similar to the Ethiopian coffee ceremony and adds to the authenticity of the experience. 4. Social & Ritual Aspect: Coffee in Sudan is more than just a beverage; it is a means of social connection. The Sudanese coffee experience commonly takes place at home or in coffee houses known as \\"qahwah.\\" Friends, family, and acquaintances gather around, indulging in deep conversations, storytelling, and bonding while enjoying their cups of coffee. 5. Presentation: Sudanese coffee is generally served in small cups or \\"finjal,\\" and biscuits, sweets, or traditional snacks like \\"Goraysha\\" often accompany the beverage. The cups are usually colorful and ornate, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of Sudan. In conclusion, the Sudanese coffee experience is a beautiful fusion of aromatic flavors, traditional brewing methods, and the cultural importance of community gatherings. It is a perfect way to immerse oneself in Sudanese lifestyle and tradition while enjoying a delicious and warming beverage."},{"instruction":"Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle.

The kingdom is a traditional monarchy, with the king holding absolute power and making all decisions for the kingdom. The king's sons, Prince Edward and Prince William, have very different personalities and motivations, which ultimately lead to a power struggle between them. Prince Edward is the eldest son and the heir to the throne. He is a strong and ambitious leader, determined to prove himself worthy of his father's legacy. He is also fiercely competitive and sees his younger brother, Prince William, as a threat to his position. Edward is willing to do whatever it takes to maintain his power, even if it means betraying his own family. On the other hand, Prince William is the king's advisor and the younger son. He is intelligent and strategic, but lacks the same ambition and ruthlessness as his brother. William is content with his role as the king's advisor and does not desire the throne. However, he is also fiercely loyal to his family and will do anything to protect them, even if it means going against his brother's wishes. The plot of the narrative centers around the power struggle between the two brothers. As the king grows older and weaker, Edward becomes more determined to secure his position as the next ruler. He begins to manipulate and scheme, using his father's declining health to his advantage. Meanwhile, William tries to maintain peace and stability within the kingdom, but his efforts are constantly thwarted by his brother's actions. The themes of power, family, and loyalty are prominent throughout the narrative. The king's sons are both driven by their desire for power, but their approaches and motivations are vastly different. Edward is willing to sacrifice his family for his own gain, while William prioritizes the well-being of his family over his own ambitions. This creates a complex dynamic between the two brothers, as they struggle to balance their personal desires with their familial responsibilities. The narrative also explores the role of monarchy in different historical and cultural contexts. In traditional monarchies, the king holds absolute power and is often seen as a divine figure. This is reflected in the character of the king, who is both wise and ruthless, and expects unquestioning loyalty from his subjects. However, as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that this absolute power can also lead to corruption and conflict within the royal family. Comparatively, in constitutional monarchies, the power of the monarch is limited by a constitution or parliament. This allows for a more balanced distribution of power and prevents one individual from having too much control. In the narrative, this can be seen in the character of Prince William, who serves as the king's advisor and provides a check on his brother's actions. The narrative also draws parallels to real-life examples of power struggles within royal families. In the British monarchy, there have been numerous instances of siblings competing for the throne, such as the rivalry between Queen Elizabeth I and her sister, Mary Queen of Scots. Similarly, in ancient Rome, there were often power struggles between siblings for control of the empire, such as the conflict between Julius Caesar and his brother, Gaius. In terms of character development, Prince Edward's motivations and actions are driven by his desire for power and recognition. He is willing to betray his family and manipulate others to achieve his goals. As the story progresses, his actions become more ruthless and he becomes consumed by his thirst for power. On the other hand, Prince William's character development is centered around his loyalty to his family and his struggle to maintain peace within the kingdom. He initially tries to reason with his brother and find a compromise, but as Edward's actions become more extreme, William is forced to take a stand and protect his family. This ultimately leads to a shift in his character, as he becomes more assertive and willing to challenge his brother's authority. In conclusion, \\"The King's Heir and Advisor\\" is a compelling narrative that explores the themes of power, family, and loyalty within a traditional monarchy. The characters of Prince Edward and Prince William provide a nuanced portrayal of the complexities of sibling rivalry and the impact of absolute power on individuals and their relationships. Through its exploration of different historical and cultural contexts, the narrative highlights the potential dangers of unchecked power and the importance of balance and accountability in a monarchy.

Show that you're engaged by nodding and using verbal cues like \\"uh-huh\\" or \\"I see\\". Try to understand their perspective and ask clarifying questions if needed. Summarize their points to ensure you've understood correctly. Active listening can build trust, foster better understanding, and improve relationships. It shows respect and can lead to more productive conversations. Scenario: Imagine you're talking to a friend who's upset about a recent argument. Friend: \\"I just had a huge argument with Sam. I'm really upset.\\" You: \\"I'm sorry to hear that. You seem really upset. Can you tell me more about what happened?\\" (This shows empathy and invites them to share more.) As you listen, you nod and occasionally say \\"I see\\" to show you're engaged. After they've finished, you summarize: \\"So, you're upset because you felt Sam didn't value your opinion. Is that correct?\\" This approach can help your friend feel heard and understood, which can strengthen your relationship."},{"instruction":"ggest instagram theme page ideas where i can post ai generated images and get a good LVT from the users.

Here's a step-by-step guide to build such a model: 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:    - Gather a diverse collection of scripts that cover various genres, styles, and character types to train your model.    - Annotate the scripts for beats and character objectives. Ideally, involve theater practitioners or experts to help you with annotation.    - Preprocess the data by cleaning, tokenizing, and splitting it into train and test datasets. 2. Beat Identification Model:    - Develop a model to identify the beats in the script. Consider using a sequence tagging model, like a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network combined with Conditional Random Fields (CRF).    - Train the model on the annotated scripts, ensuring that it can accurately identify the beats. 3. Character Intentions Model:    - Design a model to extract character intentions in the script by considering contextual information like dialogue, character relationships, actions, and emotions.    - Experiment with pre-trained NLP models like BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT that have been fine-tuned for similar tasks.    - Train the model on the annotated data to understand character intentions. 4. Actors' Objective Extraction Model:    - Develop a model to suggest actors' objectives for each beat. You may use a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanisms to process the input (script and character info) and output relevant objectives.    - To generate diverse and coherent objectives, implement techniques like beam search or top-k sampling, which allow for more flexibility in the output. 5. Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning:    - Evaluate the performance of the model on the test dataset. Measure its accuracy through metrics such as Intent Classification Accuracy, F1-score, and perplexity.    - Iterate the model and fine-tune any parameters where necessary. 6. User Interface Development:    - Design an intuitive user interface that allows actors to upload scripts and receive suggested objectives for each beat. Provide options for different levels of granularity, like scene-based or beat-based objectives. 7. Continuous Improvement:    - Regularly update the model with new scripts and feedback from users to maintain its relevancy and accuracy. Building a Character Objective Extraction Model is a complex process that requires expertise in NLP, AI, and theater knowledge. Ensure that you consult experts in these fields and collaborate with potential users (actors, directors) to develop a tool that meets their needs."},{"instruction":"Suggestions for NLP Analysis of Customer Reviews of Restaurants","output":"Performing NLP analysis on customer reviews of restaurants can provide valuable insights that help restaurants improve their services and customers make informed decisions.

Here's a basic plan you could start with: 1. **Bag Push-ups**: Use your school bag as resistance. Place it on your back while doing push-ups. Start with 3 sets of 10 reps. 2. **Bag Squats**: Hold your school bag in front of your chest or place it on your shoulders, then perform squats. Start with 3 sets of 15 reps. 3. **Bag Lunges**: Similar to squats, hold your bag in front of your chest or place it on your shoulders, then perform lunges. Start with 3 sets of 10 reps for each leg. 4. **Bag Rows**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend at the waist (keeping your back straight), hold your bag with both hands, and pull it towards your chest. Start with 3 sets of 10 reps. 5. **Bag Overhead Press**: Hold your bag at chest level, then push it straight up and bring it back down. Start with 3 sets of 10 reps. 6. **Bag Pull-ups**: If you feel comfortable and safe, you can add your school bag as extra weight while doing pull-ups. Start with as many reps as you can do comfortably in 3 sets. Remember, the key to a good workout is proper form and control, not just the amount of weight or the number of repetitions. Always warm up before starting your workout and cool down afterwards. If you feel any pain (other than normal muscle fatigue) while doing these exercises, stop immediately and consult with a fitness professional or a healthcare provider.  Also, keep in mind that this is just a basic plan. Depending on your fitness level and goals, you might need to adjust the number of sets, reps, or exercises. It's always a good idea to consult with a fitness professional when starting a new workout routine."},{"instruction":"ggest me few options for iconpacks for react, nextjs, tailwindcss.

Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein is a book that provides a wealth of concepts that can be used for a project. Here are some ideas: 1. Defaults: This concept is about how people tend to make decisions based on defaults, or the options that are presented to them first. For example, if you want people to sign up for an organ donation program, you could make it the default option when they renew their driver's license. 2. Anchoring: This concept refers to how people rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making a decision. For example, if you want people to buy a more expensive car, you could start by showing them a very expensive car and then show them a cheaper one. 3. Framing: This concept is about how the way information is presented can influence people's decisions. For example, if you want people to exercise more, you could frame it as a way to improve their health rather than as a chore. 4. Nudges: This is the main concept of the book, and it refers to small changes in the environment or default options that can encourage people to make better decisions. For example, you could nudge people to save more money by automatically transferring a small amount from their checking account to their savings account each month. 5. Social proof: This concept refers to how people tend to make decisions based on what others are doing. For example, if you want people to recycle, you could show them pictures of people recycling and highlight the positive impact it has on the environment. 6. Loss aversion: This concept is about how people tend to be more sensitive to losses than to gains. For example, if you want people to save more money, you could frame it as a way to avoid losing money in the future rather than as a way to gain more. 7. Scarcity: This concept refers to how people tend to value things more when they are scarce. For example, if you want people to buy tickets to a concert, you could limit the number of tickets available and create a sense of urgency. These are just a few of the many concepts from \\"Nudge\\" that can be used for a project. The key is to understand how people make decisions and to use that knowledge to nudge them in the right direction."},{"instruction":"Suggest some courses for anyone with a strong computer science background but who is new to LLMs","output":"Here are some suggested courses for someone with a CS background but new to LLMs: • Introduction to Natural Language Processing - This will provide an overview of the field of NLP and various techniques like parsing, semantic analysis, machine translation, etc. Useful for anyone getting started with NLP. • Statistical Machine Translation - This course will dive into the details of machine translation, an important application of NLP.

The policy was enacted to address the growth rate of China’s population, which the government viewed as being too high. In late 2015 the government announced that the one-child limit per family would end in 2016. Here are some of the major consequences of the policy. Assistant: From 1980 to 2016 the Chinese government enforced a policy requiring most couples to have only one child, with some exceptions. By the end of 2015, the policy was changed to allow two children per couple.  Some important effects of the policy were a surging population of only-children, reduced gender ratio, and an increase in the number of births by unmarried women.

It has been proposed that attentional templates integrate target features (e.g., purple chair) to guide attention in an object-based fashion. Alternatively, it may be that attentional templates are established for each target feature individually (e.g., purple and chair). To provide support for the latter account, we used a task where participants memorized a target shape while ignoring an irrelevant color. In the combined condition, the shape was shown in the irrelevant color. In the separate condition, the irrelevant color was spatially separate from the shape. After the initial presentation and a blank retention interval, participants were asked to make a saccade to the initially viewed shape, which was shown together with a distractor. Attentional guidance by the irrelevant color was strongly reduced with separate presentation, suggesting that guidance is object-based. However, it may be that irrelevant color was less reliably encoded with separate presentation. Therefore, we asked participants to store the irrelevant color for later recall. With the additional memory task, guidance by irrelevant color occurred regardless of whether it was presented as part of an object or separately. Thus, effects of irrelevant features are easier to observe with combined presentation because all features of an object are automatically encoded into working memory, where they form integrated feature templates. Nonetheless, guidance by separate features is possible, but the poor encoding of irrelevant features with separate presentation makes it more difficult to observe","output":"This study by Dirk Kerzel and Stanislas Huynh Cong from the University of Geneva investigates how attentional selection is guided by templates of target features in working memory. The researchers aimed to understand if attentional templates integrate target features as objects (e.g., purple chair) or individually (e.g., purple and chair). They conducted an experiment where participants memorized a target shape while ignoring an irrelevant color. The researchers presented the shape and color either combined or separately before asking participants to make a saccade (quick eye movement) towards the initially viewed shape among distractors. The attentional guidance by the irrelevant color was reduced with separate presentation, indicating object-based guidance. However, they also considered that irrelevant color might be less reliably encoded with separate presentation. To test this, they added a memory task for participants to store the irrelevant color for later recall. With this added task, guidance by irrelevant color occurred regardless of whether it was combined or separate. In conclusion, the study suggests that attentional guidance can be influenced by irrelevant features if they are successfully encoded into working memory. Combined presentation makes it easier to observe the effects as all features of an object are automatically encoded, forming integrated feature templates. Nevertheless, guidance by separate features is possible, but the weaker encoding of irrelevant features with separate presentation makes it harder to detect."},{"instruction":"mmarise below conversation - \\"Agent: Good morning, this is [Car Rental Company].

It's an essential tool in veterinary medicine, particularly during anesthesia, as it offers real-time information about the patient's respiratory status, metabolism, and the effectiveness of the circulatory system. For student veterinary nurses, understanding capnography involves several key points: 1. **Understanding CO2 Production and Elimination**: CO2 is a byproduct of cellular metabolism and is eliminated from the body via the respiratory system. Any changes in metabolism, lung function, or blood circulation can affect CO2 levels. 2. **Interpreting Capnograms**: A capnogram is a waveform with different phases representing inhalation and exhalation. Changes in the shape, height, or baseline of the capnogram can indicate various conditions, such as hypoventilation, hyperventilation, or equipment malfunction. 3. **Clinical Applications**: Capnography is used during anesthesia to monitor ventilation and detect any abnormalities early. It can also be used in critical care settings to monitor patients with respiratory or metabolic disorders. 4. **Troubleshooting**: Understanding common issues with capnography, such as equipment problems or patient-related factors, is crucial. For example, a sudden drop in CO2 could indicate disconnection or occlusion of the breathing system, while a gradual increase might suggest hypoventilation. Remember, capnography is a valuable tool, but it should be used in conjunction with other monitoring methods and clinical assessments for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's status."},{"instruction":"Summarise how to apply for an Arts Council grant in the UK","output":"Certainly!

The author argues that our current understanding of the world and ourselves is based on a delusion that has been perpetuated by our culture and society. The book is divided into three main sections, each of which explores a different aspect of this delusion and its impact on our lives. The first section of the book, titled \\"The Grand Delusion,\\" explores the idea that our understanding of the world is based on a set of beliefs and assumptions that are fundamentally flawed. The author argues that these beliefs, which include the idea of a self, the concept of free will, and the belief in a separate, objective reality, are not based on any evidence or logical reasoning. Instead, they are the result of our cultural and social conditioning, and have been passed down from generation to generation. The second section of the book, titled \\"The Search for Meaning,\\" explores the idea that our search for meaning and happiness is ultimately futile. The author argues that our desire for meaning and happiness is rooted in our delusion, and that we will never find true meaning or happiness until we recognize and let go of this delusion. The author also explores the concept of suffering, and argues that our suffering is a result of our attachment to our delusions and our inability to let go of them. The third section of the book, titled \\"The Path to Freedom,\\" explores the idea that the only way to find true freedom and happiness is to let go of our delusions and embrace the truth of our existence. The author argues that this requires a radical transformation of our understanding of the world and ourselves, and that it is not something that can be achieved overnight. The author also explores the idea of mindfulness and meditation, and argues that these practices can help us to cultivate a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Throughout the book, the author uses a variety of examples and anecdotes to illustrate his points and to make his ideas more accessible to the reader. He also draws on a wide range of scientific research and philosophical theories to support his arguments and to provide a more nuanced understanding of the issues he explores. One of the key themes of the book is the idea that our search for meaning and happiness is ultimately a futile endeavor. The author argues that our desire for meaning and happiness is rooted in our delusions, and that we will never find true meaning or happiness until we recognize and let go of these delusions. He also explores the concept of suffering, and argues that our suffering is a result of our attachment to our delusions and our inability to let go of them.

As the model needs 352GB in bf16 (bfloat16) weights (176*2), the most efficient set-up is 8x80GB A100 GPUs. Also 2x8x40GB A100s or 2x8x48GB A6000 can be used. The main reason for using these GPUs is that at the time of this writing they provide the largest GPU memory, but other GPUs can be used as well. For example, 24x32GB V100s can be used. Using a single node will typically deliver a fastest throughput since most of the time intra-node GPU linking hardware is faster than inter-node one, but it's not always the case.

Whether you're a seasoned backpacker or a first-time traveller, here are some unique tips to help make your solo trip safe and enjoyable. 1- Choose Your Destinations Carefully One of the most important things to consider when traveling to India is packing the appropriate clothes for your destination. The weather in the north and south of the country can vary greatly, so it’s important to pack clothes that are suitable for the climate. For instance, the mountainous areas in the north can reach lows of 7 degrees Celsius during the coldest time of the year, while the south won’t usually drop below 25 degrees all year round. 2- Learn Some Local Dialects In addition to Hindi, India has many local dialects and languages that vary from state to state. Learning some basic phrases in the local dialect of the region you're visiting can help you connect with locals on a deeper level and show your respect for their culture. 3- Embrace Indian Food India is a food lover's paradise, with a diverse range of cuisine that varies from region to region. Embrace the local food and try everything from street food to fine dining. Don't be afraid to ask locals for recommendations, and be open to trying new things. 4- Respect Local Customs and Culture India has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, and it's important to respect local customs and traditions. Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites, and remove your shoes before entering temples and homes. Also, be mindful of local customs around food, social interactions, and public behavior. 5- Purify your water Some people assume that food poisoning can only come from the food you eat, but a lot of the time it can come from contaminated water. It is recommended to drink fresh, bottled water and to check the seal of the bottle before purchasing. Investing in a water bottle with an integrated filter can also save money and reduce the use of plastic bottles.","output":"Solo backpacking in India offers adventure but poses challenges.

The system extends from the surface to at least 850 meters down-dip depth. The central alteration system is a broad (over 1 kilometer in diameter) outer propylitic alteration shell, which gradually zones inward to several inner propylitic and potassic alteration zones. This reflects the increasing temperature of hydrothermal fluids westwards and towards the center of the Bottletree Prospect. Two distinct mineralizing events have been recognized, with early-stage copper-gold-molybdenum mineralization associated with prograde potassic alteration and a late-stage molybdenum-dominant event likely associated with a separate porphyry intrusion. The style of Cu-Mo veins recognized in the wall rocks is typical of exploration pathfinders used to vector towards blind porphyry mineralization. The prograde propylitic-potassic alteration is overprinted by retrograde alteration. The discovery of high-grade molybdenum mineralization associated with late-stage tonalite porphyry intrusions, with up to a spectacular 5.2% Mo (1m assay) encountered in BTDD010, suggests that the Bottletree Prospect has the potential to host significant copper-molybdenum mineralization.

Similarly, in soil cut areas, the final “subgrade” level can be tested using the DCP after excavation. However, if the cut is in rock, testing with the DCP would not give any meaningful results.

Several of the canonical empirical patterns are replicated, with the varied trained participants tending to perform better during testing in both experiments. A major issue with previous research in the cross-disciplinary “benefits of variability” literature is that many previous works do not adequately control for the similarity between training and testing conditions. Such issues arise when both from failures to consider the possibility of non-linear generalization, and from often the unquestioned assumption that participants are acquiring, and then generalizing from prototype or schema-based representations. I introduce a theoretically motivated method of explicitly quantifying the similarity between training experience and testing condition. The resulting similarity quantity can then be used to explicitly control for similarity (by adding it as a covariate to the statistical model). The effect of variability remains significant while controlling for similarity, which I argue is a more rigorous demonstration of the effect of variability on testing performance than what is typically provided with standard methods. I conclude by introducing an extended version of the model that assumes training variation influences the steepness of the generalization gradient. With this flexible similarity mechanism, the group-level effect of variability can then be accounted for within the similarity-based generalization framework. Link to Project 1 page Alternatively, click here to download pdf of the journal article corresponding to project 1. Project 2 In Project 2, a modified version of the task from Project 1 is used in conjunction with a testing procedure that challenges participants to extrapolate well beyond their training experience. In line with previous research in the function learning literature, participants show evidence of successful extrapolation in our linear task environment. Surprisingly though, the constant training group outperforms the varied training group consistently across numerous variants of the task. Such a pattern is far from unheard of in the vast literature on training variability, and it is therefore remains a worthwhile challenge to evaluate the ability of similarity-based models to account for the observed effects. Additionally, the cognitive process models implemented for project 2 will go beyond the modelling efforts of the previous project in two respects. 1) Extensions that enable the model to produce predictions of participant responses, and 2) fitting and attempting to account for behavior in both training AND testing phases of the experiment. Link to Project 2 page Project 3 For the third and final project, I will take advantage of a large dataset from Lost In Migration, a popular online game resembling the classic Eriksen flanker task. Due to randomization of game trials, some users experience much more variability in the early phases of the game than others. Additionally, the dataset provided by Lumos labs includes data from users who experienced a ‘high variability’ version of the game before being switched to the standard version. I will assess the influence of both variability-via-randomization, and variability-via-manipulation, and once again evaluate the ability of similarity-based-generalization models to account for the observed patterns. While the key theoretical questions, and general modeling approach will remain the same as the first two projects, the Lost In Migration’s dataset will present the opportunity to examine the influence of variability in a much more graded fashion, and to assess the ecological validity of the phenomena.

Its bell usually reaches about 16 cm in diameter but can grow up to 35 cm. From each of the four corners of the bell trails a cluster of 15 tentacles. The pale blue bell has faint markings; viewed from certain angles, it bears a somewhat eerie resemblance to a human head or skull. Since it is virtually transparent, the creature is nearly impossible to see in its habitat, posing significant danger to swimmers. When the jellyfish are swimming, the tentacles contract so they are about 150 mm (5.9 in) long and about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter; when they are hunting, the tentacles are thinner and extend to about 3 m (9.8 ft) long. The tentacles are covered with a high concentration of stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are activated by pressure and a chemical trigger; they react to proteinous chemicals. Box jellyfish are day hunters; at night they are seen resting on the ocean floor. In common with other box jellyfish, NAME_1. fleckeri has four eye-clusters with 24 eyes. Some of these eyes seem capable of forming images, but whether they exhibit any object recognition or object tracking is debated; it is also unknown how they process information from their sense of touch and eye-like light-detecting structures due to their lack of a central nervous system. They are attracted to light of different colors (white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue), but blue light seems to elicit a feeding behavior, as it slows down their pulsation rate and makes them stream out their tentacles. Black objects, on the other hand, cause them to move away. Chironex fleckeri lives on a diet of prawns and small fish and are prey to turtles, whose thick skin is impenetrable to the cnidocytes of the jellyfish.","output":"Sure, here are some key points about the Australian box jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri, for your school presentation: 1.

The new facility consists of two buildings, namely the design development base “CLAY” and the IT development base “ITs”. The FUJIFILM Creative Village, due to open in May 2023, is aimed at facilitating designers and IT engineers to exert creativity and maximize performance, while amassing the strengths of the two groups to accelerate the creation of innovation, thereby developing innovative products and services.  Artist’s impression of the exterior view of the FUJIFILM Creative Village Fujifilm’s designers worked on the development from concept creation to architectural and spatial design of the FUJIFILM Creative Village. Both “CLAY” and “ITs\\" have an exterior characterized by wide, open windows and sharp and solid concrete construction. In addition, facilities and unique features have been introduced to allow designers and IT engineers express their creativity in a spacious, pillar-less space. “CLAY” features a video studio and a prototype production room equipped with 3D printers and coating booths, while “ITs\\" has a workspace layout that can be used in different ways depending on the development phase, including a desk layout for small groups of IT engineers to discuss and create concept, and individual booths for programming and other tasks that require concentration.  The FUJIFILM Creative Village will employ a variety of energy-saving technologies. The buildings’ thermal insulation performance will be improved by installing heat-insulating materials inside the building frame, and adopts a “double-skin façade”, double structure with glass covering the exterior walls of the building, on the south and east sides, where sunlight penetrates into the building, to reduce the load on air conditioning and lighting. In addition, all electricity used in the building will be derived from renewable energy sources to achieve a carbon-neutral building. Based on the belief that a close partnership between the design and IT teams is essential in creating new value that contributes to solving social issues, Fujifilm works to develop innovative products and services by combining the power of both to generate innovation. Through this FUJIFILM Creative Village, Fujifilm will maximize the creativity and productivity of both design and IT divisions, and accelerate the development value-creating products and services by strengthening partnership between these divisions, thereby contributing to solving social issues.

Segregation by design: Local politics and inequality in American cities. Cambridge University Press, 2018: Chapter 10.","output":"Trounstine's chapter 10, \\"The Persistence of Residential Segregation,\\" from her book \\"Segregation by Design: Local Politics and Inequality in American Cities\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2018) examines the reasons why residential segregation remains a significant issue in many American cities despite the legal victories and policy changes aimed at desegregation. The chapter argues that residential segregation is not solely the result of individual choices or prejudices but rather a deliberate outcome of local political and economic decisions. Trounstine contends that segregation has been perpetuated through zoning laws, housing policies, and urban planning practices that have created and maintained racial and economic segregation. For instance, many cities have historically used zoning laws to restrict the type of housing that can be built in certain neighborhoods, thereby limiting the availability of affordable housing in predominantly white neighborhoods. Similarly, housing policies have often prioritized homeownership over rental housing, leading to a shortage of affordable rental options in many cities. The chapter also highlights the role of other factors, such as discriminatory lending practices, redlining, and the disinvestment of public resources in low-income neighborhoods, in perpetuating segregation. Trounstine argues that these practices have contributed to the persistence of segregation by limiting access to credit and capital for low-income and minority homebuyers, making it more difficult for them to purchase homes in more affluent neighborhoods. Trounstine concludes that addressing residential segregation will require a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of the problem, including local political and economic decisions that perpetuate segregation. She argues that policies such as inclusionary zoning, affordable housing programs, and targeted investments in low-income neighborhoods could help to reduce segregation and promote more equitable and inclusive urban development."},{"instruction":"Summarise what an API for ordering gravel would look like, and how the business could be profitable","output":"An API (Application Programming Interface) for ordering gravel would typically include the following features: 1.

The burning of fossil fuels has caused air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. It has also accelerated climate change, leading to more extreme weather conditions and sea levels rising.","output":"Title: The Devastating Effects of Fossil Fuels on the Environment Summary: The combustion of fossil fuels has had a profound impact on our planet, contributing to several types of pollution, ranging from air and water to land, while exacerbating climate change. This has resulted in increasingly severe weather patterns, rising sea levels, and grave implications for ecosystems and human health.  Air Pollution: Burning fossil fuels releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat, leading to global warming and the formation of smog, which can be detrimental for human health, especially impacting the respiratory system. Water Pollution: Runoff from fossil fuel industry operations and byproducts like coal ash and oil spills can contaminate water sources, threatening aquatic ecosystems and human health. Acid rain generated by the emission of SO2 and NOx can further harm aquatic life, damage forests, and erode buildings and sculptures. Land Pollution: The extraction, transportation, and disposal of fossil fuels result in land pollution, including deforestation, habitat destruction, and soil degradation. Leaks and spills, as seen in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, can devastate ecosystems and lead to long-lasting consequences for biodiversity. Climate Change: The increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion has accelerated climate change, causing more frequent and intense extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and droughts. This disrupts ecosystems, leads to crop failures, and poses significant threats to human life and property. Sea Level Rise: As temperatures increase and polar ice caps melt, sea levels are rising, resulting in coastal flooding that endangers human settlements and causes habitat loss for various plant and animal species. Low-lying coastal areas and islands are at the highest risk of becoming submerged.  The adverse effects of fossil fuels on the environment necessitate swift actions and the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources to mitigate the long-term, potentially irreversible consequences for our planet and future generations."},{"instruction":"Summarize and translate the follwing to german: NAME_1 giant rocket explodes minutes after launch from Texas SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas (AP) — NAME_1’s giant new rocket exploded minutes after blasting off on its first test flight Thursday and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico.

Each edge connects a pair of vertices. 2. **Directed and Undirected**: Graphs can be either directed or undirected. In a directed graph, each edge has a direction, from one vertex to another. In an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction; they simply connect two vertices. 3. **Weighted and Unweighted**: In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. In an unweighted graph, edges do not have any weights. 4. **Cyclic and Acyclic**: A graph is cyclic if there is a path from a vertex back to itself. If no such paths exist, the graph is acyclic. 5. **Connected and Disconnected**: In a connected graph, there is a path between every pair of vertices. In a disconnected graph, some vertices may not be reachable from others. 6. **Degree**: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. In a directed graph, we can distinguish between in-degree (number of incoming edges) and out-degree (number of outgoing edges). 7. **Adjacency**: Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them. 8. **Path**: A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge. 9. **Graph Representation**: Graphs can be represented in several ways, including adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and edge list. 10. **Graph Algorithms**: There are many algorithms designed specifically for graphs, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and many more.

From Character.ai's chatbot last spring to ChatGPT in November and Bard in December, the user experience created by tuning language models for chat has been a hot topic. The emergence of open access and open-source alternatives has further fueled this interest. The Current Environment of Open Source Chatbots The success of these chat models is due to two training paradigms: instruction finetuning and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF). While there have been significant efforts to build open source frameworks for helping train these kinds of models, such as trlX, trl, DeepSpeed Chat and ColossalAI, there is a lack of open access and open source models that have both paradigms applied. In most models, instruction finetuning is applied without RLHF training because of the complexity that it involves. Recently, Open Assistant, Anthropic, and Stanford have begun to make chat RLHF datasets readily available to the public. Those datasets, combined with the straightforward training of RLHF provided by trlX, are the backbone for the first large-scale  instruction fintuned and RLHF model we present here today: StableVicuna.  Introducing the First Large-Scale Open Source RLHF LLM Chatbot We are proud to present StableVicuna, the first large-scale open source chatbot trained via reinforced learning from human feedback (RLHF). StableVicuna is a further instruction fine tuned and RLHF trained version of Vicuna v0 13b, which is an instruction fine tuned LLaMA 13b model. For the interested reader, you can find more about Vicuna here.   Similarly, here are a number of benchmarks showing the overall performance of StableVicuna compared to other similarly sized open source chatbots.  In order to achieve StableVicuna’s strong performance, we utilize Vicuna as the base model and follow the typical three-stage RLHF pipeline outlined by NAME_1 et NAME_2. and NAME_3 et NAME_2. Concretely, we further train the base Vicuna model with supervised finetuning (SFT) using a mixture of three datasets: OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1), a human-generated, human-annotated assistant-style conversation corpus comprising 161,443 messages distributed across 66,497 conversation trees, in 35 different languages; GPT4All Prompt Generations, a dataset of 437,605 prompts and responses generated by GPT-3.5 Turbo; And Alpaca, a dataset of 52,000 instructions and demonstrations generated","output":"The development of chatbots has recently gained significant attention, with the release of models like Character.ai, ChatGPT, and Bard.

Whether it’s helping doctors detect diseases earlier or enabling people to access information in their own language, AI helps people, businesses and communities unlock their potential. And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we’ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our important advances in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today. Introducing Bard It’s a really exciting time to be working on these technologies as we translate deep research and breakthroughs into products that truly help people. That’s the journey we’ve been on with large language models. Two years ago we unveiled next-generation language and conversation capabilities powered by our Language Model for Dialogue Applications (or LaMDA for short). We’ve been working on an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA, that we’re calling Bard. And today, we’re taking another step forward by opening it up to trusted testers ahead of making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks. Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity, helping you to explain new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right now, and then get drills to build your skills. Use Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old. We’re releasing it initially with our lightweight model version of LaMDA. This much smaller model requires significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback. We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information. We’re excited for this phase of testing to help us continue to learn and improve Bard’s quality and speed. Bringing the benefits of AI into our everyday products We have a long history of using AI to improve Search for billions of people. BERT, one of our first Transformer models, was revolutionary in understanding the intricacies of human language. Two years ago, we introduced MUM, which is 1,000 times more powerful than BERT and has next-level and multi-lingual understanding of information which can pick out key moments in videos and provide critical information, including crisis support, in more languages. Now, our newest AI technologies — like LaMDA, PaLM, Imagen and MusicLM — are building on this, creating entirely new ways to engage with information, from language and images to video and audio. We’re working to bring these latest AI advancements into our products, starting with Search. One of the most exciting opportunities is how AI can deepen our understanding of information and turn it into useful knowledge more efficiently — making it easier for people to get to the heart of what they’re looking for and get things done. When people think of Google, they often think of turning to us for quick factual answers, like “how many keys does a piano have?” But increasingly, people are turning to Google for deeper insights and understanding — like, “is the piano or guitar easier to learn, and how much practice does each need?” Learning about a topic like this can take a lot of effort to figure out what you really need to know, and people often want to explore a diverse range of opinions or perspectives. AI can be helpful in these moments, synthesizing insights for questions where there’s no one right answer. Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner. These new AI features will begin rolling out on Google Search soon. Mobile phone showing a Search query for \\"is piano or guitar easier to learn and how much practice does each need?\\" The search result page displays an answer to the question, powered by AI When looking for insights, AI features in Search can distill information to help you see the big picture. Helping developers innovate with AI Beyond our own products, we think it’s important to make it easy, safe and scalable for others to benefit from these advances by building on top of our best models. Next month, we’ll start onboarding individual developers, creators and enterprises so they can try our Generative Language API, initially powered by LaMDA with a range of models to follow. Over time, we intend to create a suite of tools and APIs that will make it easy for others to build more innovative applications with AI. Having the necessary compute power to build reliable and trustworthy AI systems is also crucial to startups, and we are excited to help scale these efforts through our Google Cloud partnerships with Cohere, C3.ai and Anthropic, which was just announced last week. Stay tuned for more developer details soon. Bold and responsible It’s critical that we bring experiences rooted in these models to the world in a bold and responsible way. That’s why we’re committed to developing AI responsibly: In 2018, Google was one of the first companies to publish a set of AI Principles. We continue to provide education and resources for our researchers, partner with governments and external organizations to develop standards and best practices, and work with communities and experts to make AI safe and useful.

The story is set in a futuristic society where people are genetically engineered and conditioned to play specific roles in a strictly hierarchical society. The society is characterized by the absence of disease, poverty, and suffering, but also lacks individual freedom, creativity, and emotional depth. The use of a drug called \\"soma\\" ensures that citizens remain content and compliant. Key aspects of the novel that can be related to the emergence of AI technology include: 1. **Control and Conditioning**: In \\"Brave New World\\", humans are conditioned from birth to accept their roles in society. This can be compared to how AI is programmed and trained to perform specific tasks. However, unlike the humans in the novel, AI does not have consciousness or free will. 2. **Loss of Individuality**: The society in the novel discourages individuality and promotes conformity. Similarly, AI lacks individuality as it operates based on pre-set algorithms and cannot develop unique thoughts or emotions. 3. **Ethical Considerations**: The novel raises questions about the ethics of manipulating human biology and behavior for societal benefit. Similarly, the development and use of AI technology raises ethical questions, such as the potential for misuse, the impact on jobs, and issues of privacy and security. 4. **Dependence on Technology**: In \\"Brave New World\\", society is heavily dependent on technology for its functioning. This mirrors our increasing dependence on AI and other technologies in various aspects of life, from healthcare to transportation to entertainment. 5. **Dehumanization**: The novel portrays a society where human relationships and emotions are devalued. While AI can mimic human interaction to some extent, it lacks genuine human emotion and empathy, which can lead to concerns about dehumanization in an AI-dominated future. It's important to note that while these comparisons can provide interesting insights, AI is a tool created and controlled by humans, and does not possess consciousness or emotions. The future of AI and its impact on society largely depends on how we choose to develop and use this technology."},{"instruction":"Summarize Chapter 3 of \\"The Model Pastor\\" and highlight the key themes of Rev.

The apostle Paul explains how God had chosen to save and bless the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, despite their sinful nature and disobedience. Paul explains that God's election was not based on human effort or merit, but on His sovereign will and purpose. He uses the examples of Ishmael and Esau, who were not chosen as the heirs of God's promises, to illustrate this point. Paul also addresses the issue of why some Jews had rejected Jesus as the Messiah, despite being God's chosen people. He explains that it was not because God's promises had failed, but because of their unbelief and rejection of God's grace. Finally, Paul emphasizes the importance of faith in God's sovereignty, and encourages believers to trust in His plan and purpose, even when they may not fully understand it."},{"instruction":"Summarize conversation \`\`\`Customer: Customer A Use case: Customer A has an ETL process to transform data on Databricks that involves several SQL steps and each of them creates temporary tables used by the next step: Step 1 creates temporary table temp_A Step 2 creates temporary table temp_b reading temp_a Step 3 creates temporary table temp_c reading temp_b etc The temporary table won't be in Atlan.

The book emphasizes the importance of deep work, which is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a state of flow where you can produce high-quality work in less time. Newport argues that deep work is valuable, rare, and meaningful. However, in our current society, shallow work, which is non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks often performed while distracted, is more common. These tasks do not create much new value and are easy to replicate. The book provides various rules and strategies to cultivate a deep work ethic, such as: 1. Work Deeply: Create rituals and routines to minimize the willpower necessary to transition into a state of deep work. 2. Embrace Boredom: Train your brain to be comfortable with doing nothing and resist distractions. 3. Quit Social Media: Limit the use of social media and other technologies that can fragment attention. 4. Drain the Shallows: Minimize shallow work and make sure your time is spent on truly valuable activities. Newport suggests that by integrating these practices into our lives, we can train our brains to focus better, improve our productivity, and achieve more in less time."},{"instruction":"Summarize Dena Rash Guzman’s creative process in writing a poem inspired by Swoon’s footage and sounds.: Dena Rash Guzman supplies the words and voice for a Swoon video that includes footage from a 1915 version of Alice in Wonderland by W.W. Young. Guzman “wrote the poem inspired by raw footage and sounds send to her by Swoon,” according to the description on Vimeo, following which he re-edited the footage and added the silent film images. I chose ‘Alice in Wonderland’ footage to layer with the ‘dirt-video’ you knew. I love writing from prompts and so when you sent me the video and sound samples I sat down to ingest them like a glass of wine. I kind of meditated on the titles of the samples and the content itself and began firing off poem after poem. Dirt was the inspiration for the poem you selected. Dirt makes me think of earth, soil, dust, decay. It’s not dirty, though it can impose itself to make things so. For me, dirt is a host for the living, and that brought me to a childhood experience: I got lice at school when I was 8. It was exciting to take your work, give you mine, and get your work back. I’m a fan of Poem films and yours in particular and it was a great experience.","output":"Dena Rash Guzman's creative process for writing a poem inspired by Swoon's footage and sounds began with immersing herself in the raw materials provided by Swoon. The video included footage from a 1915 version of Alice in Wonderland by W.W. Young, which Guzman found particularly inspiring. To incorporate the given materials into her work, Guzman treated the video and sound samples like a prompt, savoring them as one would a glass of wine. She meditated on both the titles and the content, allowing the ideas to spark her creativity and resulting in a series of poems. The selected poem uses the concept of \\"dirt\\" as its central theme, invoking ideas of earth, soil, dust, and decay. Guzman drew from her childhood memories and experiences to embrace the notion of dirt as an essential element of life, rather than focusing on its potentially negative connotations. This culminated in the recollection of getting lice at school when she was eight, adding a personal touch to the poem. The collaboration between Guzman and Swoon was an exciting and inspiring experience for her, as she was a fan of poem films and Swoon's work. The process of exchanging creative ideas and getting back a re-edited version incorporating her poetry was particularly fulfilling for Guzman."},{"instruction":"Summarized me a book zero to one in every chapter with high detail and real case scenario","output":"Sure, here's a detailed summary of Peter Thiel's \\"Zero to One\\" with real case scenarios: Chapter 1: The Challenge of the Future Thiel emphasizes the importance of creating new things as opposed to copying what already works. He uses the example of his own company, PayPal, which was a unique idea that revolutionized online payments. Chapter 2: Party Like It's 1999 Thiel discusses the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, using it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of blind optimism and herd mentality. He uses the example of Pets.com, which despite massive investment, failed due to a lack of sustainable business model. Chapter 3: All Happy Companies Are Different Thiel argues that successful companies are successful because they are unique. He uses the example of Google, which succeeded because it was the only company that could do what it did at the time - provide an effective search engine. Chapter 4: The Ideology of Competition Thiel discusses the drawbacks of competition and the benefits of monopolies. He uses the example of Microsoft, which has been able to generate massive profits due to its near-monopoly in the operating system market. Chapter 5: Last Mover Advantage Thiel argues that being the last mover in a market can be advantageous, as it allows a company to learn from the mistakes of others. He uses the example of Facebook, which was not the first social network, but is the most successful. Chapter 6: You Are Not a Lottery Ticket Thiel discusses the role of luck in success, arguing that planning and strategy are more important. He uses the example of SpaceX, which succeeded not through luck, but through careful planning and execution. Chapter 7: Follow the Money Thiel discusses the power law, and how a small number of companies generate the majority of value in the venture capital industry. He uses the example of his own investment in Facebook, which generated more returns than all his other investments combined. Chapter 8: Secrets Thiel discusses the importance of discovering and pursuing \\"secrets\\" or untapped opportunities. He uses the example of Airbnb, which discovered the \\"secret\\" that people were willing to rent out their homes to strangers. Chapter 9: Foundations Thiel discusses the importance of a strong foundation in a startup. He uses the example of the early days of PayPal, where a strong founding team was crucial to its success. Chapter 10: The Mechanics of Mafia Thiel discusses the importance of a strong company culture, using the example of the \\"PayPal Mafia\\" - a group of early PayPal employees who have since founded a number of successful tech companies. Chapter 11: If You Build It, Will They Come? Thiel discusses the importance of sales and distribution, not just product development. He uses the example of the Segway, which despite being a technological marvel, failed due to poor marketing and distribution. Chapter 12: Man and Machine Thiel discusses the relationship between technology and labor, arguing that technology should be used to complement human labor, not replace it. He uses the example of IBM's Watson, which assists doctors in diagnosing diseases. Chapter 13: Seeing Green Thiel discusses the challenges of the clean tech industry, using the example of Solyndra, a solar panel company that went bankrupt despite massive government funding. Chapter 14: The Founder's Paradox Thiel discusses the paradox of successful founders, who often have extreme personalities. He uses the example of Richard Branson and Steve Jobs, who despite their eccentricities, were able to build successful companies."},{"instruction":"Summarize: Dr David AlDulaimi is resigning from Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, which is run by Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.

Give a short but complete explanation about every topic, give a formula and an example. Output in the format below: Topic: Explanation: Formula and example:","output":"Sure, I'll provide a brief overview of some key topics in high school algebra up to grade 10. Please note that the curriculum can vary depending on the educational system, but these are generally covered. Topic: Linear Equations Explanation: Linear equations are equations of the first degree, meaning they only contain first powers of the variable. They represent straight lines when graphed. Formula and Example: The general form is y = mx + b. For example, in the equation y = 2x + 3, m is the slope (2) and b is the y-intercept (3). Topic: Quadratic Equations Explanation: Quadratic equations are second-degree polynomials. They have a variable that's squared, and they represent a parabola when graphed. Formula and Example: The general form is ax^2 + bx + c = 0. For example, in the equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, a is 1, b is -5, and c is 6. Topic: Factoring Explanation: Factoring is the process of breaking down an expression into a product of simpler expressions. It's used to simplify equations or expressions. Formula and Example: For the quadratic x^2 - 5x + 6, it can be factored into (x - 2)(x - 3). Topic: Systems of Equations Explanation: Systems of equations are a set of two or more equations with the same variables. The solution is the point(s) where all the equations intersect when graphed. Formula and Example: For the system y = 2x + 3 and y = -x + 1, the solution is the point (0.5, 4) where both lines intersect. Topic: Inequalities Explanation: Inequalities describe an interval of solutions, rather than a single solution. They use symbols like >, <, ≥, and ≤. Formula and Example: For the inequality 2x + 3 > 1, the solution is x > -1. Topic: Exponents and Radicals Explanation: Exponents are a way of expressing repeated multiplication, while radicals represent the inverse operation, the root. Formula and Example: For the exponent, 2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8. For the radical, √9 = 3. Topic: Functions Explanation: Functions are a special type of relation where every input (x-value) has exactly one output (y-value). Formula and Example: For the function f(x) = 2x + 3, if we input 1 (f(1)), the output is 5. Topic: Polynomials Explanation: Polynomials are expressions consisting of variables and coefficients, involving operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. Formula and Example: An example of a polynomial is 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 7. Remember, this is a very high-level overview and each topic has many subtopics and additional details that you would learn in a full algebra course."},{"instruction":"mmarize follow paragraphs.

Then, provide advice on which vitamins and minerals should be supplemented if NAC is taken over a longer period of time. Include all supplements that will be necessary or that you would recommend and give the reason for them. # Input: Acetylcysteine is indicated for mucolytic therapy and in the management of acetaminophen overdose. It has a short duration of action as it is given every 1-8 hours depending on route of administration, and has a wide therapeutic window. Patients should be counselled regarding diluting oral solutions in cola for taste masking, the risk of hypersensitivity, and the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Acetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine, a precursor to the biologic antioxidant glutathione. Hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores.Glutathione, along with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), have been found to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators. At millimolar concentrations, they may also modulate the redox state of the NMDA receptor complex. In addition, glutathione has been found to bind to and activate ionotropic receptors that are different from any other excitatory amino acid receptor, and which may constitute glutathione receptors, potentially making it a neurotransmitter. As such, since N-acetylcysteine is a prodrug of glutathione, it may modulate all of the aforementioned receptors as well. Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting at the redox site. L-cysteine also serves as a precursor to cystine, which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter on astrocytes; hence there is increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses of acetylcysteine, mGluR5. Acetylcysteine also possesses some anti-inflammatory effects possibly via inhibiting NF-κB and modulating cytokine synthesis. Acetylcysteine is extensively liver metabolized, CYP450 minimal, urine excretion is 22–30% with a half-life of 5.6 hours in adults and 11 hours in newborns. A number of possible mechanisms for the mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine have been proposed. Acetylcysteine's sulfhydryl groups may hydrolize disulfide bonds within mucin, breaking down the oligomers, and making the mucin less viscous. Acetylcysteine has also been shown to reduce mucin secret","output":"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) works in several ways: 1. It acts as a prodrug to L-cysteine, which is a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, helping to replenish its stores in the body. 2. Glutathione, which NAC helps produce, can bind to and modulate various receptors, potentially acting as a neurotransmitter. 3. L-cysteine, which NAC helps produce, also leads to increased glutamate release into the extracellular space, affecting various glutamate receptors. 4. NAC has anti-inflammatory effects, possibly by inhibiting certain pathways and modulating cytokine synthesis. 5. As a mucolytic agent, NAC can break down mucin, making it less viscous and reducing its secretion. If you're taking NAC over a longer period, it's important to ensure you're also getting adequate amounts of other nutrients. Here are some recommendations: 1. **Vitamin C**: This vitamin helps with the absorption of NAC and also works synergistically with it due to its antioxidant properties. 2. **Selenium**: This mineral is essential for the proper functioning of glutathione, the antioxidant that NAC helps to replenish. 3. **Vitamin B6, B9, and B12**: These vitamins are involved in the metabolism of amino acids like cysteine, the product of NAC metabolism. 4. **Magnesium**: This mineral is important for many biochemical reactions in the body, including those involving NAC. Remember, it's always best to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen. They can provide personalized advice based on your health history and current needs."},{"instruction":"Summarize how technology has impacted education.","output":"Technology has significantly transformed education in numerous ways.

Like, what you can do is you can look at the past historical returns. So let's say in the universe, there were only two stocks, IBM and apple. You just look at, you know, the returns of IBM and apple and then you basically regress against each other and you can find a correlation between those two stocks. And so every portfolio that you form only will have because there's only two trades, two tradable units and as well, you just you can use that and you can use the correlation matrix. So, the correlation matrix will become two by two because IBM and it has to be the variance and covariance. It's, you know, because it's a two by two matrix. You know, it's simple. It's, it's easier to handle that in the various use cases like portfolio construction or, you know, figuring out residual risk and so on, so forth. Now, the second biggest problem was that, you know, once once you get to watch, add more and more stocks, you know, you get to like, for example, in US there's 10,000 securities so you will get to a problem of 10,000 by 10,000 matrix to model to to see all the correlations. If you add the global stocks, I will become like somewhere around the most tradable stocks are like 65,000 by 65,000. So, the matrix, it's a data becomes pretty large. So, the first and foremost problem was dimensionality reduction. So, that is one one aim of risk models to reduce the dimensionality. So that, you know, you can you can handle a handle any portfolio, modeling risk of any portfolio in a much faster fashion. So that's problem number one. Problem number two is, you know, all of this data when you're modeling correlations they are they're based on past history, right? Like so. You want to be, you want model correlations such that they are robust that they that you know, you're not taking advice. So, you know, you want to you want they are predictive in nature and not like, you know, expert exterminator in nature.

Bara or actual, by the way, they also they are in the business they have been doing this for more than banks, but they they model this. They have to based model that they use. They also started off using statistical model like a PCA model to do the dimensionality reduction and solve and make it robust, but they also have like what is called a cross sectional model, c","output":"- The fundamental problem of measuring risk involves looking at past historical returns. For example, if there were only two stocks, IBM and Apple, you could look at their returns and find a correlation between them. - This correlation can be used to form a portfolio and can be represented in a correlation matrix. In this case, it would be a 2x2 matrix representing the variance and covariance. - However, as the number of stocks increases, the size of the correlation matrix also increases. For example, in the US there are 10,000 securities, leading to a 10,000x10,000 matrix. Globally, the most tradable stocks could lead to a 65,000x65,000 matrix. - The first major problem is dimensionality reduction, which is necessary to handle the large amount of data and to model the risk of any portfolio more efficiently. - The second problem is that these correlations are based on past history.

(1995). Visual object recognition (Vol. 2). Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT press.","output":"Biederman's 1995 book, \\"Visual Object Recognition,\\" is a comprehensive examination of the cognitive processes involved in recognizing and identifying visual objects. The book is divided into two volumes, with volume 1 focusing on the perception of visual objects and volume 2 focusing on the cognitive processes involved in object recognition. In volume 1, Biederman proposes a theory of \\"projective clustering,\\" which suggests that objects are perceived as three-dimensional (3D) shapes despite being viewed from different angles. He argues that the visual system groups together features that are related to the 3D structure of an object, creating a \\"recognition image\\" that allows us to identify the object regardless of its orientation. Volume 2 of the book focuses on the cognitive processes involved in object recognition. Biederman argues that object recognition involves two primary processes: identification and verification. Identification refers to the process of recognizing an object as a specific category (e.g., recognizing a chair as a type of furniture). Verification refers to the process of determining whether a perceived object matches our mental representation of an object. Biederman suggests that these processes are supported by separate brain mechanisms, with identification relying on the temporal lobe and verification relying on the parietal lobe. Biederman also emphasizes the importance of \\"holistic\\" processing in object recognition. He argues that we tend to recognize objects as a whole rather than as a concatenation of individual features. This holistic processing allows us to recognize objects quickly and accurately, even when they are partially obscured or viewed from unusual angles. Throughout the book, Biederman draws on evidence from a variety of sources, including neuroimaging studies, neuropsychological case studies, and behavioral experiments. He also discusses the implications of his theory for a range of psychological phenomena, including object recognition in infants, the effects of brain damage on object recognition, and the role of attention in object recognition. Overall, \\"Visual Object Recognition\\" is a comprehensive and influential work that has had a significant impact on the field of cognitive psychology. Biederman's theory of projective clustering and his emphasis on holistic processing and separate mechanisms for identification and verification have shaped our understanding of how we recognize visual objects."},{"instruction":"Summarize in few token about the food : Good food.

Here at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, the Electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire, or ePAQ, is used to assess pelvic floor symptoms in women. So it is a PROM that's specific to a particular clinical area rather than being generic. Here we talk to Dr. Steve Radley about its development and application. ePAQ is an electronic questionnaire system. It's web-based. It's designed for clinical use. It allows patients to self-complete a comprehensive and detailed assessment of their symptomatology and associated health-related quality of life. It evolved from questionnaires developed as research outcome measures but now has evolved into something that's very much for clinical use, for routine clinical assessment of patients. We issue vouchers, which are sent out to patients, posted or emailed to patients, to allow them to complete the questionnaire at home using the internet. And most of our patients, about 70% of patients, will now do this at home before they come to clinic. And also, post-operatively or post-intervention patients will, again, complete the questionnaire, the majority doing so at home. And the majority of surgical cases will be able to then be seen or assessed in a virtual clinic, the virtual clinic being ePAQ combined with telephone consultation. So I was aware of the value and the power of using questionnaires-- well-validated questionnaires, well-designed questionnaires-- for monitoring outcomes in research. And what I wanted to do was translate that into clinical practice and to use it routinely for all patients coming into this unit. And what we found when we tried to do that on paper was that we generated a lot of paper, and it's a bit of a waste of time, a bit of a waste of paper. We spent a lot of time looking at the results and actually realised that thumbing through a long paper document isn't particularly useful and is not actually feasible in practice. So the other thing you find is when you've got piles of data on paper, at some point in the working week somebody's got to enter these data to a computer. And the \\"eureka!\\" moment, really, was when I was sitting there working through a pile of paper, and I thought, why don't we get the patients to enter the data directly into a database? The danger with data that are collected by clinicians and recorded by clinicians in case notes is that it's interpreted. And so it's often very valuable -- and, clearly, talking to doctors and doctors talking to patients is a key element of the clinical assessment process. However, if you've got an objective measure and detailed measure of a patient's symptomatology before you see them, it's recorded independently, then it's a very powerful tool to support and enable a detailed, robust and valid assessment of their symptoms, quality of life, which then can inform clinical practice. In my area of gynaecology, urogynecology, I'm dealing with patients with very sensitive, somewhat taboo conditions; urinary incontinence, prolapse, and associated sexual dysfunction. ePAQ really helps to explore those issues with patients. Quite often, things like sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, they're very difficult to talk about. Patients often won't talk to their partners about it, may not be completely open with their GPs and with gynaecologists. So enabling that process and getting a good understanding of intimate issues actually proves very helpful and actually quite often uncovers symptoms and concerns that may not have even been recorded or considered prior to the questionnaire being used. The beauty of it within our practice is that it's actually an integral part of our day-to-day clinical practice. It's not a burden to us to do this, it actually adds value. So we're actually doing something that's previously perceived as being burdensome, i.e. filling in questionnaires and collecting data. But actually, that adds value to the clinical process. So it actually makes that whole process more meaningful and valuable. But actually, having set out to improve the quality of our outcome measures in our practice, what I've actually developed is something that improves communication with my patients. And I think a lot of clinicians who use ePAQ find that actually it improves communication and therefore the clinical care they're able to provide. So the original aim of ePAQ was to improve the quality of data collection for outcomes monitoring. Actually, one of the most valuable aspects of ePAQ use from my perspective is a better understanding of my patients and their conditions and their concerns.","output":"The Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield uses an electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire (ePAQ) to assess pelvic floor symptoms in women.

Pink, published in 2011, provides insights and strategies for motivating individuals in the workplace and beyond. The book explores the concept of Motivation 3.0, which emphasizes autonomy, mastery, and purpose as key drivers of human motivation. Here's a summary of the book's main ideas: 1. The Three Types of Motivation: Pink identifies three distinct motivational drives: Motivation 1.0 (survival), Motivation 2.0 (reward and punishment), and Motivation 3.0 (intrinsic motivation). The latter is the most powerful and sustainable, as it taps into people's innate desires for autonomy, mastery, and purpose. 2. Autonomy: People have an inherent need to feel in control of their work, lives, and destiny. Autonomy is essential for Motivation 3.0, as it allows individuals to make choices, take risks, and assume responsibility for their actions. 3. Mastery: Humans have a natural desire to improve their skills and abilities. Pink argues that providing opportunities for people to learn, grow, and achieve mastery is crucial for maintaining motivation. 4. Purpose: People seek to be part of something larger than themselves, to contribute to a cause that has meaning and significance. Purpose-driven motivation is a potent force in fostering long-term engagement and dedication. 5. Extrinsic Motivators vs. Intrinsic Motivation: Pink emphasizes that external rewards and punishments (Motivation 2.0) can actually undermine intrinsic motivation (Motivation 3.0) in the long run. Instead, leaders should focus on cultivating an environment that supports autonomy, mastery, and purpose. 6. The Four Drives: Pink identifies four drives that fuel Motivation 3.0: a. The Drive to Learn: People are motivated by the desire to learn, understand, and make sense of the world around them. b. The Drive to Create: Humans have a natural inclination to create, innovate, and bring new ideas to life. c. The Drive to Connect: People are motivated by the need to form connections, build relationships, and contribute to a community. d. The Drive to Defend: Individuals are driven to defend their values, beliefs, and causes they believe in. 7. The Six A's: Pink outlines six factors that can help foster Motivation 3.0 in individuals and organizations: a. Autonomy: Provide opportunities for people to make choices and take ownership of their work. b. Achievement: Set challenging goals and allow individuals to experience a sense of accomplishment. c. Appreciation: Acknowledge and recognize people's efforts and contributions. d. Affiliation: Create a sense of belonging and community. e. Authority: Empower individuals to take charge of their work and make decisions. f. Adventure: Offer opportunities for exploration, experimentation, and growth. 8. The Power of Purpose: Pink emphasizes the importance of purpose in motivating people. He suggests that leaders should help individuals find their purpose, align it with the organization's goals, and create opportunities for purpose-driven work. 9. The Role of Leaders: Pink argues that leaders play a crucial role in fostering Motivation 3.0. They must create an environment that supports autonomy, mastery, and purpose, and focus on helping individuals develop their skills and abilities. 10. The Implications of Motivation 3.0: Pink acknowledges that transitioning to a Motivation 3.0 approach may be challenging, especially in organizations with entrenched Motivation 2.0 systems. However, he argues that the benefits of increased engagement, creativity, and productivity make the shift worthwhile. In summary, \\"Motivation 3.0: How to motivate people to stay motivated!\\" provides insights and strategies for motivating individuals in the modern workplace and beyond. By focusing on autonomy, mastery, and purpose, leaders can create an environment that fosters intrinsic motivation and leads to sustained engagement, creativity, and success."},{"instruction":"Summarize NAME_1's core characteristics given the following input.

Some of his most profound and novel ideas include: * Mimetic desire: NAME_2 argued that human desire is not inherent or natural, but is instead learned through imitation and modeling. He suggested that our desires are not our own, but are instead derived from our observations and imitations of others. This concept of mimetic desire helps to explain the origins of human culture and socialization. * The scapegoat mechanism: NAME_2 proposed that the scapegoat mechanism is a fundamental aspect of human culture, in which societies unconsciously identify a person or group as the cause of their problems and then reject and persecute them. This Mechanism is used to release tension and conflict in the society, by externalizing the problems and blaming them on an other. * The sacrificial crisis: NAME_2 argued that human history is characterized by a series of sacrificial crises, in which societies become increasingly violent and aggressive as they try to appease their gods or sacred powers. He suggested that the origin of sacrifice is to be found in the fundamental human desire to imitate and surpass our rivals, which leads to a competition for status and recognition, and ultimately to violence. * The origins of religion: NAME_2 argued that religion is not a response to the mysteries of the universe, but rather a response to the problems of society. He suggested that religion is a way for societies to manage and control their internal conflicts, by providing a sense of transcendence and a sense of order. * The anthropology of sacrifice: NAME_2 proposed that sacrifice is a fundamental aspect of human culture and society, and that it is closely linked to the development of language, culture, and society. He argued that the origins of sacrifice can be traced back to the mimetic desire of early humans to imitate and surpass their rivals, and that this desire continues to play a role in human culture and society today. Overall, NAME_2's work focuses on understanding the human desire, behavior, culture and religion from a different perspective, and how these aspects are interconnected and influence each other."},{"instruction":"Summarize: NAME_1, the U.S. investment company led by prominent investor NAME_2, said on Monday that it has purchased additional shares in five major Japanese trading houses, sending its average ownership of them to more than 8.5%.

She flees to the wilderness, alone and free, To find a new world, a chance to be. But danger lurks, in the shadows deep, As Lauren's journey unfolds, her sleep. A cult of fanatics, with a twisted creed, Hunts her down, their evil deed. Lauren must fight, to survive the test, A warrior, with a heart that's blessed. She battles on, through trials and strife, For a brighter future, a new life. In this poem, I've tried to capture the essence of Parable of the Sower, Lauren's journey, a tale of endurance. A world in ruin, a heroine's quest, A hope for change, a brighter crest. Octavia Butler's novel, a masterpiece of art, A warning of what could happen in the heart.

Here are some key takeaways from the chapter on this topic: 1. Prioritize: Leaders must identify the highest priority task and focus on it first. They must resist the urge to try to do everything at once and instead concentrate on the most critical objective. 2. Execute: Once the priority has been identified, leaders must execute with extreme determination and focus, using all available resources to achieve the objective. They must take full responsibility for the outcome. 3. Decentralize Command: In order to effectively prioritize and execute, leaders must trust their team members to take initiative and execute their own tasks. By delegating responsibility, leaders can free themselves to focus on their own critical task. 4. Focus on the important, not the urgent: Leaders must resist the temptation to be distracted by urgent but less important tasks, and instead concentrate on the most important objectives. 5.

It's divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. 1. Inferno: The story begins with Dante lost in a dark forest, symbolizing spiritual confusion. Virgil, the ancient Roman poet, appears as a guide sent by Beatrice (Dante's ideal woman). They descend into Hell (Inferno), which is divided into nine circles, each one a punishment for a specific sin, increasing in severity. Dante encounters various historical and mythological figures along the way, each suffering for their sins. 2. Purgatorio: After exiting Hell, Dante and Virgil climb Mount Purgatory, a place where souls purge their sins to prepare for entrance into Heaven. The mountain has seven terraces, corresponding to the seven deadly sins. As they ascend, they meet souls who are making amends for their sins and learning the nature of virtue. 3. Paradiso: Beatrice guides Dante through the celestial spheres of Heaven. These spheres correspond to different virtues and are populated by saints and other righteous individuals. The journey culminates in the Empyrean, where God resides. Dante experiences a vision of divine love and unity, which is beyond human comprehension.

Do not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor. 10. Do not desire anything that belongs to your neighbor. Five Precepts (Buddhism): 1. Refrain from killing or harming living beings. 2. Refrain from stealing or taking what is not given. 3. Refrain from sexual misconduct or engaging in any sexual act that is not consensual. 4. Refrain from false speech, lies, or gossip. 5. Refrain from intoxicating substances that cloud the mind. Both sets of guidelines are meant to promote ethical and moral behavior, but there are some differences in their approach: 1. Christianity emphasizes the importance of faith and belief in God, while Buddhism emphasizes personal responsibility and self-discipline. 2. The Ten Commandments are seen as absolute and unchanging, while the Five Precepts are considered flexible and context-dependent. 3. Christianity has a more detailed and complex system of moral teachings, while Buddhism's Five Precepts are simpler and more straightforward. 4. Christianity places a strong emphasis on salvation and redemption through faith in Jesus Christ, while Buddhism focuses on personal liberation and enlightenment through ethical conduct and mindfulness. 5. Christianity has a more hierarchical and authoritarian structure, with a clear distinction between clergy and laity, while Buddhism is generally more egalitarian and emphasizes personal responsibility and self-discovery. In conclusion, while both sets of guidelines share some similarities, they have distinct approaches and emphases, reflecting the different philosophical and theological traditions of Christianity and Buddhism."},{"instruction":"mmarize the 7 habits of highly effective people in great detail","output":"Certainly! The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, as outlined by Stephen Covey in his book of the same name, are a set of principles for personal and professional development. Here's a detailed summary of each habit: Habit 1: Be Proactive * The first habit is about taking responsibility for your life and choices. * It's about recognizing that you have the power to choose how you react to situations and to shape your own destiny. * Proactive people focus on things they can control, rather than dwelling on things they can't. * They also prioritize long-term goals and take a long-term perspective in their decision-making. Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind * The second habit is about setting clear goals and priorities. * It's about identifying what is most important to you and aligning your actions with those values. * Proactive people have a clear vision of what they want to achieve, and they prioritize their time and resources accordingly. * They also regularly review and adjust their goals to ensure they are still relevant and achievable. Habit 3: Put First Things First * The third habit is about prioritizing and managing your time effectively. * Proactive people focus on the most important tasks first and delegate or eliminate less important tasks. * They also learn to say no to non-essential tasks and commitments, and they avoid multitasking, which can lead to decreased productivity and increased stress. Habit 4: Think Win-Win * The fourth habit is about creating mutually beneficial relationships. * Proactive people seek to understand and empathize with others, and they work to find solutions that benefit all parties. * They also practice self-discipline and seek to build trust and credibility with others. * They avoid win-lose situations and seek to create win-win outcomes whenever possible. Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood * The fifth habit is about effective communication and empathy. * Proactive people seek to understand the perspectives and needs of others before seeking to be understood themselves. * They listen actively and ask open-ended questions to gain a deeper understanding of others. * They also practice empathy and seek to find common ground with others. Habit 6: Synergize * The sixth habit is about collaboration and teamwork. * Proactive people seek to work with others to achieve greater results than they could alone. * They practice diversity and inclusivity, and they seek to create a sense of community and collaboration in their work. * They also recognize that different perspectives and strengths can lead to better outcomes when combined. Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw * The seventh habit is about self-care and personal renewal. * Proactive people recognize that they need to take care of themselves in order to be effective in their personal and professional lives. * They prioritize self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, and goal-setting. * They also seek to continuously improve themselves through learning and personal growth. In summary, the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People are a set of principles for personal and professional development that focus on taking responsibility, setting clear goals, prioritizing and managing time effectively, creating mutually beneficial relationships, effective communication and empathy, collaboration and teamwork, and self-care and personal renewal. By practicing these habits, individuals can become more effective in their personal and professional lives and achieve greater success and fulfillment."},{"instruction":"SUmmarize the Absurd by NAME_1.","output":"The Absurd is a philosophical concept introduced by NAME_1 in his works, particularly in the novel \\"The Plague\\" and in his essay \\"The Myth of Sisyphus.\\" The concept of The Absurd refers to the experience of feeling the world to be meaningless or undesirable, in the face of the human condition and the lack of inherent meaning in the universe. In the novel, \\"The Plague,\\" the characters struggle to comprehend the meaning and purpose of their lives in the face of a devastating disease that has wiped out most of the population. The city is transformed into a place where people are constantly confronted with death and the meaninglessness of their existence. In this context, The Absurd is seen as an existentialist concept, where individuals are faced with a world that is completely indifferent to their existence and lack any inherent meaning or purpose. In his essay, \\"The Myth of Sisyphus,\\" NAME_2 further developed the concept of The Absurd. He argued that the human condition is characterized by a persistent feeling of alienation and despair in the face of the meaninglessness of existence. He also argued that the human need to find meaning in life is a sign of our humanity and that this search for meaning is a source of inspiration and creativity. However, he also argued that ultimately, this search for meaning is futile, and that we must learn to accept the absurdity of life. Overall, NAME_2' concept of The Absurd is a recognition of the human condition and the lack of inherent meaning in the universe.

Lawmakers spoke to students, including Gov. John Hickenlooper. Posted 7:05 a.m. | Updated 2:56 p.m. Denver-area students marched to the grounds of the state Capitol Wednesday, joining in a nationwide march protesting violence in schools and demanding new gun control measures from lawmakers. \\"One child is worth more than all the guns on Earth,\\" stated one sign held by a protester. \\"I should feel lucky I get to go to school,\\" read another, \\"Not lucky that I made it home alive.\\" Many of the student protesters marched from nearby East High School and other local schools. The event coincided with dozens of other walkouts across Colorado meant to mark one month since the deadly shooting inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Among those at the Capitol was Lar Amadeo, who started at the Denver School of the Arts this year after moving from outside Parkland. She learned from television that her friend, Alex Schachter, had died. Amadeo told her Denver classmates she didn't want their pity — just their political support for gun control. \\"Every day I go to school afraid that I am going to die,\\" she said. \\"And I don't think that should happen anymore.\\" Gov. John Hickenlooper and Democratic lawmakers addressed the crowd. They reminded protestors that Colorado passed universal background checks and a high-capacity magazine ban following the Aurora theater shooting. They also promised to fight efforts to arm teachers. At Columbine High School in Littleton, the site of a 1999 mass shooting, hundreds of students held a silent vigil. Thirty balloons were released, one for each of the 17 victims of the Parkland shooting and 13 for each Columbine victim. The protests even spread to the Auraria college campus in downtown Denver. About 40 students and faculty walked out of class demanding new gun control laws. \\"I’m just exhausted,\\" said Tammy Garrett Williams, a Metro State political science student and the mother of a Columbine survivor. \\"And I don’t know what else to do.\\" Outside the metro area, in downtown Colorado Springs, police estimated close to a thousand students at Palmer High School and community members joined in the walkout. \\"They’re leading and we’re listening,\\" Rachel Jabailey of Colorado Springs said of the students. \\"It’s a different day and so I just wanted to bring myself physically to show support and be here to witness this.\\" Adults and supporters in the community gathered in front of Palmer High School in Colorado Springs before the walkout on Wednesday, March 14, 2018. Taylor Anderson, a junior at Palmer, held an orange and white sign that said, \\"Protect kids, not guns.\\" \\"I’m really tired of adults not taking us seriously and politicians not taking us seriously,\\" Anderson said. Further south, hundreds of students filed out of Pueblo's Central High School just before 10 a.m. Some carried signs and the mood was solemn. Each minute, for 17 minutes, student leaders read the names of each person killed in Parkland along with a bit of bio on each one — then the rest of the minute was silent until the next name was read. At the end of the readings white doves were released in memorial. Several dozen adults lined up on the sidewalk behind the students, many from Pueblo Indivisible, and a few carrying signs that said \\"we've got your backs.\\" Wednesday's nationwide action is one of several protests planned for coming weeks. The March for Our Lives rally for school safety is expected to draw hundreds of thousands to the nation's capital on March 24, its organizers said. A similar event is organized in Denver and will rally on the same day in Civic Center Park. And another round of school walkouts is planned for April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting.

Instead, our genes perform experiments, which require feedback from the environment and corrections of errors. Only with trial and errors can our body properly grow. Our genes contain an elaborate knowledge of which experiments need to be done, and this knowledge of trial-and-error approaches has been acquired through eons of evolution. We kept whatever worked well for our ancestors. However, this knowledge alone is not enough to make us intelligent. To create intelligent behavior such as thinking, decision making, understanding a poem, or simply detecting one’s friend in a crowd of strangers, our bodies require yet another type of trial-and-error knowledge. There are mechanisms in our body that also contain elaborate knowledge for experimenting, but they are much faster. The knowledge of these mechanisms is not collected through evolution but through the development over the lifetime of an individual. These fast adaptive mechanisms continually adjust the big network of our connected nerve cells. These adaptation mechanisms can change in an eye-blink the way the brain networks are effectively connected. It may take less than a second to make a change necessary to recognize one’s own grandmother, or to make a decision, or to get a new idea on how to solve a problem. The slow and the fast adaptive mechanisms share one thing: They cannot be successful without receiving feedback and thus iterating through several stages of trial and error; for example, testing several possibilities of who this person in distance could be. Practopoiesis states that the slow and fast adaptive mechanisms are collectively responsible for creation of intelligence and are organized into a hierarchy. First, evolution creates genes at a painstakingly slow tempo. Then genes slowly create the mechanisms of fast adaptations. Next, adaptation mechanisms change the properties of our nerve cells within seconds. And finally, the resulting adjusted networks of nerve cells route sensory signals to muscles with the speed of lightning. At the end behavior is created.","output":"The theory of practopoiesis proposes that the growth and development of living organisms, including the human body, is the result of a hierarchical process involving both slow and fast adaptive mechanisms. The slow mechanisms, which are shaped by evolution over millions of years, provide a framework for the body to experiment and learn through trial and error. These mechanisms are responsible for the body's growth and development, and they are constantly adjusting and refining the body's systems and structures to better adapt to the environment. However, the fast adaptive mechanisms, which are developed over the lifetime of an individual, are responsible for more complex cognitive functions such as thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving. These mechanisms are able to rapidly adjust and adapt the body's neural networks in response to changing conditions, allowing for quick and efficient processing of sensory information and the creation of new ideas and solutions. The theory of practopoiesis suggests that both the slow and fast adaptive mechanisms are necessary for the creation of intelligence, and that they are organized into a hierarchical structure. Evolution creates genes at a slow pace, which are then used by the mechanisms of fast adaptations to create and adjust the body's neural networks. These networks are then able to route sensory signals to muscles with incredible speed, allowing for complex behaviors and intelligent actions to occur. In summary, practopoiesis proposes that the growth and development of living organisms, including the human body, is the result of a hierarchical process involving both slow and fast adaptive mechanisms. These mechanisms work together to create and refine the body's systems and structures, and to enable complex cognitive functions such as thinking and problem-solving."},{"instruction":"Summarize the benefits of hiring recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) providers from overseas.: Every company wants most efficient employees. To find these employees, you often need to hire a recruiter. The cost of hiring a recruiter varies from country to country and hence to cut costs, companies have been hiring recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) providers from overseas. It is a popular concept among companies of all types as they get the advantage of paying lower costs to offshore recruiters for the same quality of work. Every RPO provider has a set recruitment process. Since the candidate goes through several levels of interview, there is visibility in the process and low chances of partiality. Moreover, considering that the recruiters also have to abide by a strict recruitment process the scope of preferring one candidate over another is eliminated. India is one of the leading global RPO providers. A number of companies are increasingly outsourcing the recruitment process to overseas recruitment providers to focus on more important aspects of their business. Outsourcing the recruitment brings on board quality work as the workforce is completely engaged in building and executing strategic plans for the company’s growth. Earlier the RPO providers managed only the top management recruits, however the trend is slowly shifting towards handling the recruitment at all levels. At times, a company’s HR department might not be equipped to hire employees for highly skilled jobs. Moreover, the HR department in companies also have to carry out supporting roles like conducting employee surveys, which might take their attention off the recruitment task. Hence, hiring RPO providers in a smart move. RPO providers, in turn, have skilled and technical recruiters with years of experience who help in shortlisting the most suitable candidate for a job opening. In fact, setting up an HR department contributes significantly to the overall costs in the company. However, when a company undertakes the services of RPO providers, the latter is paid only after a successful recruitment. Finding suitable candidates and hiring them adds value to the company and its profit in the long run. RPO providers take care of everything from managing the job board, updating the company’s social media channels and respective job portals with the job opening announcements, to the time the hired candidate joins the company. RPO providers conduct cold calling, online tests, and web interviews, which usually is a time consuming process. Since they are constantly coming up with innovative recruitment techniques the system becomes very efficient, and hence they provide better recruitment services. All these aspects together confirm that offshore RPO providers are the best choice not only for startups but enterprises as well when it comes to hiring skilled candidates. Further, there is no need to maintain a huge HR department by a company, a small HR department to look after employees’ immediate needs like grievances, and payroll is sufficient enough.","output":"In summary, the benefits of hiring recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) providers from overseas include: 1. Cost-effectiveness: Companies can save on recruitment expenses by utilizing offshore RPO providers who often charge lower fees for the same quality of work. 2. Transparent recruitment process: RPO providers follow a strict and standardized recruitment process, reducing the chances of biases or partiality. 3. Focus on core business activities: Outsourcing recruitment allows companies to concentrate on their primary business objectives and growth strategies. 4. Access to skilled and technical recruiters: RPO providers have experienced recruiters who can efficiently fill specialized and high-skilled job positions. 5. Reduced HR department costs: Companies can minimize expenses related to maintaining a large HR department, as RPO providers are paid only upon successful recruitment. 6. Comprehensive recruitment support: RPO providers manage all aspects of the recruitment process, from job postings to candidate onboarding, ensuring an efficient system. 7. Innovative recruitment techniques: Offshore RPO providers constantly develop new strategies and methods for recruitment, resulting in better services for their clients. Overall, these benefits make hiring offshore RPO providers an attractive option for startups and enterprises alike, allowing them to maintain a smaller HR department focused on employee management tasks."},{"instruction":"Summarize the benefits of using SEO for online gemstone shops.: GOOGLE,HELP, I AM DROWNING!

Give statements in agreement and in opposition of his viewpoint.","output":"\\"The Bitter Lesson\\" by NAME_1 is not specified in your request. However, I can provide a summary and analysis based on the well-known essay \\"The Bitter Lesson\\" by Rich Sutton, a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence. Summary:  Rich Sutton, in \\"The Bitter Lesson,\\" argues that the most significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been made through methods that leverage computation over human-designed components. He suggests that AI should focus on developing more computational methods rather than relying on human expertise. Sutton believes that the key to AI advancement lies in the power of brute force computation and search, rather than human-like reasoning or logic. Agreement: 1. Sutton's viewpoint is valid as it is evident that many breakthroughs in AI, such as deep learning, have been achieved through computational methods. These methods have outperformed human-engineered solutions in various tasks, including image recognition and natural language processing. 2. His argument aligns with the trend of increasing computational power. As technology advances, we have access to more computational resources, which can be leveraged to develop more sophisticated AI models. 3. The success of reinforcement learning, a field where Sutton has made significant contributions, also supports his argument. It relies heavily on computation and has achieved remarkable results in areas like game playing. Opposition: 1. Critics might argue that solely focusing on computation overlooks the importance of human intuition and expertise in AI development. Human knowledge can guide the design of algorithms and make them more efficient. 2. Relying heavily on computation might lead to the creation of \\"black box\\" models, which are complex and difficult to interpret. This could pose ethical and practical challenges. 3. The approach Sutton advocates may not be feasible for all AI applications due to resource constraints. Not all organizations or researchers have access to the vast computational resources required."},{"instruction":"Summarize the book catch 22","output":"Catch-22 is a novel by Joseph Heller published in 1961. The book follows the story of Captain John Yossarian, a B-25 bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa in the Mediterranean Sea during World War II. The novel is told in a non-linear fashion, with Yossarian recounting his experiences in a series of flashbacks and dreams. Throughout the book, Yossarian struggles with the bureaucratic absurdities of the military and the irrational rules and regulations that govern his life. He is constantly trying to avoid flying more missions, as he believes that doing so will increase his chances of being killed. However, the military has its own set of rules and regulations that make it difficult for Yossarian to avoid flying. One of the main themes of the book is the concept of free will. Yossarian is constantly questioning whether he has any control over his life, or whether he is simply a pawn in a larger, more complex system. Another theme is the nature of war itself, and the way in which it can drive people to do terrible things. Overall, Catch-22 is a satirical and absurdist novel that uses humor and irony to explore the absurdities of war and the human condition. It is widely regarded as a classic of modern literature and a masterpiece of satire."},{"instruction":"mmarize the book concrete mathematics with focus on the stern-brocot-sequence","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize \\"Concrete Mathematics\\" by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth, and Oren Patashnik. The Stern-Brocot sequence is a fascinating topic in number theory that I'd be happy to explain. The Stern-Brocot sequence is a sequence of irrational numbers that was first discovered by German mathematician Carl Stern and later independently by French mathematician Émile Brocot. The sequence is defined as follows: Stern-Brocot sequence = {(2^n / (n+1)) : n = 1, 2, 3, ...} In other words, the sequence starts with the number 2 and then each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2 and dividing by the next term. For example, the first few terms of the sequence are: 2, 4 / 3, 8 / 5, 16 / 7, 32 / 9, 64 / 11, ... The sequence has several interesting properties, including the fact that it is a divergent sequence, meaning that it goes on indefinitely without repeating. It also has a fractal structure, with the terms of the sequence showing a repeating pattern of oscillations. One of the key insights of the book \\"Concrete Mathematics\\" is that the Stern-Brocot sequence has a deep connection to many other areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis. The authors show how the sequence can be used to study topics such as the distribution of prime numbers, the properties of algebraic equations, and the behavior of functions in complex analysis. For example, the authors show how the Stern-Brocot sequence can be used to prove the prime number theorem, which states that the number of prime numbers less than or equal to x grows like x / ln(x) as x approaches infinity. They also show how the sequence can be used to study the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions, and how it can be used to prove theorems about the properties of algebraic equations. Overall, the Stern-Brocot sequence is a fascinating topic in number theory that has many interesting properties and connections to other areas of mathematics. The book \\"Concrete Mathematics\\" provides a detailed and comprehensive introduction to the sequence and its applications, making it a valuable resource for mathematicians and math enthusiasts alike."},{"instruction":"Summarize the book \\"Manufacturing Consent\\" by Herman and Chomsky in approximately 500 words, in the style of a small excited child.","output":"Oh boy, oh boy! *bounces up and down* Let me tell you all about this super cool book called \\"Manufacturing Consent\\" by Herman and Chomsky! *giggles* It's like, totally amazing! *eyes light up* So, you know how sometimes you watch TV or read the news and it just seems like everything is the same?

Generate according to: For me designing the MK Low Whistle was a solitary affair: days, weeks, months and then years of slowly refining a process. When I did eventually start work on the Toob, MK’s chromatic whistle, I was working in exactly the same way that I always had been – on my own. It was while I was staring at the computer, racking my brain (and probably cursing a fair bit!) trying to get to the bottom of one design issue or another, that Brian stuck his head over my shoulder and started asking questions about what I was up to. By chance, he’d been working with the company 4C Design, who work along side me at the Design Hub in Glasgow. I was immediately impressed by how quickly he grasped the problems I was grappling with. Over coming months I was to learn of his unique mix of talents for Art, Maths, Music, Science and Design. Almost similtaneously he was working on projects in Architectural science – solving complex 3D on cutting edge architectural design in the Middle East and beyond, in music – coming up with a new musical notation, illustrating a slew of design ideas for various people, while at the same time taking time out to Dance (Tango) and play the fiddle at Glasgow’s Fiddle workshop. It was immediately obvious to me what Brian could bring to the Toob project through his appreciations and talents. While we still have a long way to go in terms in developing collaborative working methods between ourselves and the music community, I feel we could be on to something with a huge amount of potential in years to come. I always found it amazing that there wasn’t some form of chromatic whistle. I mean this is arguably the worlds oldest melodic musical instrument. Why would it be left out when almost all the other commonly thought of musical instruments are Chromatic. The number of times that I’d be playing, the music would change key and I’d have to pick up a different instrument, or awkwardly half cover a hole to play a note which sat outside the key. I only ever wanted one whistle – a tried and tested friend that I could take anywhere. I’m pretty sure I started making musical instruments just to be able to make this Chromatic Whistle that I wanted to play. But you certainly can’t make a nice Chromatic Whistle without making a great ‘basic’ one first. And so went 10 years of my life; filing, turning, banging, gluing, polishing, crafting, I worked long hours, often through the night to come up something of the highest quality that my hands, eyes and ears would allow. Early sketches were based on a revised version of the Boehm key system – as used on metal Flutes, Saxophones and Clarinets. But the more I looked at it, the more I realised that this heavily mechanised system was a product of the great age of mechanisation, and perhaps in an age where mechanics seemed to be the solution to everything, instrument designers had adopted it too enthusiastically. I thought it might be possible to something simpler and more elegant, and working with the mechanics of the hand. Even so, it was just an concept – I never expected it to work! But early prototypes surprised me – not only could I leave the original architecture of the instrument intact, but the extra notes notes didn’t seem to involve movements that were too awkward. The whistle is an instrument which has always survived on the fringes of society – with it’s simple charm it has been adopted by cultures all the way round the world. The challenge in designing and making the next generation might be trying to maintain the character of the instrument (and the music played on it). So I’ve been working on a project to create a chromatic whistle for roughly six years. It’s a typically long and protracted process for designing a musical instrument, but like so many of the things I’ve been involved with in the last few years, it might be taking longer than expected but it is actually turning out better than expected. The instrument, which is likely to be called a ‘Toob’, is based on a new key system which leaves the initial tone hole layout and architecture of the whistle in tact – making it easy for musicians to adopt. At the moment, it exists as a working prototype (it works, but it looks rubbish!), but there are still a few challenges to be faced in terms of the making and refinement. Until now I’ve kept the design ‘under my hat’ so-to-speak – this is certainly the ‘traditional’ way of approaching innovation – show somebody your ideas and they will steal them! But watching the effect that several big companies with this approach are having, and the recent emergence of collaborative working methods like open source, has caused me to think that there’s a huge amount to be gained from throwing the gates open, documenting our progress, and inviting feedback – so we can harness the expertise of the music community to make the best possible musical instrument we can. It’s an approach which will stand in complete contrast to the ‘romantic’ vision of a instrument maker, shut away, tirelessly working to perfect ‘their’ masterpiece. In addition to myself, designer Brian Loudon (Loud1design) will be collaborating on the project. It offers the opportunity for anyone to get involved with the design and testing of a next generation musical instrument. I for one am excited by what we might come up with.","output":"The author faced several challenges in designing the Toob, a chromatic whistle. One challenge was the lack of a chromatic whistle in the market, despite it being one of the oldest melodic musical instruments. The author wanted a single whistle that could play in different keys without the need to switch instruments or cover holes awkwardly.  Another challenge was finding a key system that was simpler and more elegant than the heavily mechanized Boehm key system used in other instruments. The author wanted to work with the mechanics of the hand to create a more intuitive design. Surprisingly, early prototypes showed that the concept could work, with the extra notes not requiring overly awkward movements. Maintaining the character of the whistle and the music played on it was also a challenge. The whistle has always been a simple instrument with a charm that has been adopted by cultures worldwide. The author wanted to design the next generation of the whistle while preserving its character. To address these challenges, the author collaborated with designer Brian Loudon.

This can lead to the formation of a network of small blood vessels to compensate for the blockage, which can appear like a \\"puff of smoke\\" (moyamoya in Japanese) on an angiogram. The cognitive profile of individuals with moyamoya syndrome can vary greatly, depending on the severity of the disease and the areas of the brain that are affected. However, some common cognitive and neurological symptoms may include: 1. Cognitive decline: Some individuals may experience difficulties with thinking, problem-solving, and memory. This can be due to reduced blood flow to the areas of the brain responsible for these functions. 2. Neurological symptoms: These can include headaches, seizures, and in severe cases, strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).  3. Motor function issues: Some individuals may experience weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, or problems with coordination and balance. 4. Speech and language difficulties: Some individuals may have problems with speech and language, including aphasia (difficulty understanding or producing speech). 5. Behavioral changes: Some individuals may exhibit changes in behavior or personality, such as increased irritability, mood swings, or depression. It's important to note that not all individuals with moyamoya syndrome will experience all of these symptoms, and the severity can vary greatly from person to person.

Generate according to: Margit Detweiler is the president of Gyrate Media, a content strategy firm in Brooklyn. Follow her @margit. Somewhere in midtown Manhattan, inside a floor-to-ceiling-glass conference room, three agencies huddle around a speakerphone. Another team calls from Chicago, someone is calling from an airport in Indianapolis, another phones in from Brazil. There’s the agency of record, the UX agency, the design team, the developer, the P.R. agency, the content strategist, the social media team. They’re collaborating to develop a content marketing plan for Big Brand X — except Big Brand X seems to have no intention of sharing what message or mission they’re trying to convey. Anyone involved in helping brands create content, and I’ve done this myself, will tell you this a depressingly common scenario. Brands want to be publishers, but sometimes they can’t get out of their own way. Here are the common missteps. Invariably, the conversation gets bogged down in irrelevant details and vested interests. When a brand relies heavily on multiple, external teams to formulate its mission or voice, without setting the overall direction and defining clear measurements for success, the vision can become diluted, misguided or plain wrong. “When you don’t establish clear direction, agencies have a vested interest in not taking too many risks,” said Sam Slaughter, managing editor and COO of Contently. You want to set the stage with clear guidance so that your creative teams can focus on doing what they do best, and then let them work. Details matter, but sometimes a brand can be too invested in the wrong details. On one project I worked on, for a large consumer products brand, the svp of marketing spearheading the project spent her time reviewing every piece of content, making lists of scary words to avoid (which included “because” “no” “never” “alarming” and “arsenal”) and hosting all-day sessions to review social media images with the social team, the UX lead and the design team. While some of her suggestions were valid, her efforts spent mucking through the dirty details, instead of leading the team on the overall brand and execution, meant the project never really got off the ground. Conversely, a different consumer project I worked on targeted clear metrics and a highly specific demographic. We collectively kicked off the project with a strong competitive analysis and brand guidelines. What a difference. You’ve seen this approach and clicked away fast: 30 category tabs across the top, a presence on every single social media site with nobody posting, and multiple brand messages shouting at you from every content module. G.E. has created a community of passionate science folks through its focus on “imagination at work,” four core, easy-to-remember themes (moving, curing, powering, building) and experimentation across new platforms from Tumblr to Twitter to Vine. But Craigwell stays laser-focused on her goals and what the audience wants. As Oreo and Tide showed during the Super Bowl, nimble creativity — and having the approvals to be nimble — can truly pay off. Along with brands like RedBull, NASA, Pepsi and others, G.E. has become a poster child for brand content innovation. They quickly take advantage of new platforms (they were one of the first to make six-second videos on Vine) and connect those platforms in meaningful ways. A video series on locomotives might have beautiful imagery on Instagram that’s aggregated for a community of train enthusiasts on Tumblr. Some companies think they won’t get noticed unless they include their brand and tagline in everything they do and beat people over the head with it. You’ll always have more success creating an emotional, memorable connection with your user by creating original, quality content than any #BUYMYSTUFF. But just how important is quality?","output":"Brands often make several common missteps while creating content marketing plans. Here are some of them: 1.

According to this view, justice is determined by the final outcome or end-state of these distributions, rather than by the processes or principles that led to this outcome. Nozick critiques the end-state view and contrasts it with his own entitlement theory of justice. In contrast to the end-state perspective, Nozick's entitlement theory emphasizes the importance of historical principles and individual rights. Justice, in this view, is not primarily about ensuring that goods are distributed according to a specific pattern, but rather about ensuring that transactions—such as transfers, exchanges, and acquisitions—are legitimate and based on voluntary, informed consent. Nozick's critique of the end-state view focuses on its potential to infringe upon individual freedoms and its incompatibility with a respect for individual rights. By prioritizing specific patterns of distribution—such as wealth equality or the principle of needs-based distribution—the end-state view may justify redistributive policies that violate personal property rights and coerce individuals to part with their resources. In summary, the end-state view of distributive justice is concerned with the fairness of final outcomes of resource distribution in society, while Nozick's entitlement theory focuses on the legitimacy of the processes that lead to those outcomes and the preservation of individual rights. Nozick's critique of the end-state view raises important questions about the potential tension between distributive justice and the respect for individual liberty."},{"instruction":"Summarize the events in ukraine","output":"Certainly, here is a summary of the major events in Ukraine: 1. 2014: Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych is ousted in a popular uprising, leading to a political crisis and the annexation of Crimea by Russia. 2. 2014-2015: Pro-Ukrainian forces, backed by the Ukrainian military, launch a counteroffensive against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, leading to the ongoing Donbas War. 3. 2015: Russia begins to provide military support to the separatists, including troops and weapons, leading to a significant escalation of the conflict. 4. 2014-present: Ukraine and Russia have been involved in a naval conflict in the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. 5. 2019: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is elected on a platform of ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine and improving relations with Russia. 6. 2022: Russia launches a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has led to significant fighting and casualties on both sides.

Since whenever these are refuted, the credit of Patrocles is by so much advanced. Nor does Patrocles appear to state any thing improbable when he says that the army of Alexander took but a very hasty view of every thing [in India], but Alexander himself a more exact one, causing the whole country to be described by men well acquainted with it.

Princes who trusted him with important responsibilities: Seleucus Nicator and Antiochus Soter, who were prominent leaders of their time, entrusted Patrocles with significant tasks, indicating their faith in his abilities and integrity. 2. Authors who followed his statements: Many writers and historians of the time, such as Hieronymus of Cardia, recorded Patrocles' accounts of Alexander's campaigns in India. This suggests that Patrocles' version of events was widely accepted and considered credible by contemporaries. 3. Critics who recorded their names: Historians like Hipparchus, who criticized Patrocles' accounts, did so in a way that actually reinforced his credibility. By refuting Patrocles' claims, these critics inadvertently highlighted the reliability of his testimony. 4. Alexander's own endorsement: Patrocles claimed that Alexander himself had a more detailed and accurate view of India, which he obtained by sending men familiar with the region to explore and describe it. According to Patrocles, Alexander later handed this description over to Xenocles, his treasurer. This account suggests that Alexander trusted Patrocles and valued his knowledge and expertise.

Most of the studies on IRM so far have focused on theoretical results, toy problems, and simple models.

Using natural language inference (NLI) as a test case, we start with a setting where both the dataset and the bias are synthetic, continue with a natural dataset and synthetic bias, and end with a fully realistic setting with natural datasets and bias. Our results show that in naturalistic settings, learning complex features in place of the bias proves to be difficult, leading to a rather small improvement over empirical risk minimization. Moreover, we find that in addition to being sensitive to random seeds, the performance of IRM also depends on several critical factors, notably dataset size, bias prevalence, and bias strength, thus limiting IRM’s advantage in practical scenarios.

It seems Oreos are as habit-forming as cocaine — for rats, anyhow. At least that's what a new study has found. The study was run by science professor Joseph Schroeder and his students. It used rats to test foods with a lot of fat and sugar in them, to see if the foods might be making people addicted. In other words, would it be really hard for people to stop eating those foods? The results? Rats seemed to like cookies as much as cocaine. The study shows that foods with a lot of fat and sugar do the same thing to the brain that drugs do, Schroeder said. That may explain why some people can't stop eating them, even when \\"they know they are bad for them.\\" Rats Race To Oreos The study was thought up by college student Jamie Honohan. Honohan wondered why so many poor people are obese — that is, very overweight. She wanted to test the idea that high-fat, high-sugar foods are as addictive as drugs. There was a reason Oreos were chosen, Schroeder said. The researchers wanted something that was tasty for humans as well as rats. That way the study would say something about \\"a problem facing humans.\\" Honohan said she also wanted to use something common in grocery stores. Plus, she noted, rats really like Oreos. The researchers set up two little rooms for the rats. Then, they tried several different experiments. In one experiment, rats were given Oreo cookies in one space and rice cakes in the other. It was clear that the rats preferred the Oreos, she said. They split the cookies apart and gobbled up the cream. Then, they went on to eat all the cookies. Not all the rice cakes got eaten. After this, the food was removed. The rats were given the choice of where to spend time. They spent far more time in the room where the Oreos had been, than where the rice cakes had been. Rats Get A Sugar High The researchers did the same experiment with drugs. Rats were given a shot of cocaine in one room. And in the other room, they were injected with salt water. Then the shots were stopped. The rats were given the choice of which room to spend time in. They liked the room where the drugs had been better. What did the researchers observe? The rats spent as many hours in the Oreos room as they did in the drug room. Then the researchers looked at what was going on in the rats' brains. They wanted to figure out which the rats enjoyed more — eating cookies or being given drugs. So they measured how active neurons were in the part of the rats' brain that feels pleasure. Neurons are nerve cells that carry \\"messages\\" in the brain. Rats and humans both have neurons. It turned out that the cookies activated many more neurons than the drugs did. In other words, the rats got more pleasure out of Oreos than cocaine. This suggests that \\"high-fat, high-sugar foods are addictive,\\" Schroeder said. Hard To Quit Eating High-Sugar Foods Honohan hopes people will learn something from the study. Maybe they will understand how hard it is to quit eating foods with a lot of fat and sugar. Honohan said that in some ways, junk foods may be \\"more dangerous to society than drugs.\\" This is because \\"you don't have to go (into) a dark alley to buy them. You go into any grocery store or bodega.\\" And they are cheap. The cost makes them attractive to poor people. As for Oreos, Honohan is done with them. She used to eat them before the study. \\"Now I can't even look at them,\\" she said.","output":"A study led by science professor Joseph Schroeder and his students found that Oreos can be as addictive as cocaine for rats.

Title: Pixel Fold leak details full specs, free Pixel Watch perk, more Content: There have been quite a few leaks for the Pixel Fold over the past week. Thanks to NAME_1 of Front Page Tech, we now have all of the detailed specs for the Pixel Fold. NAME_2 starts out by confirming the 1,799 price for the Pixel Fold. It will come in Chalk and Obsidian 256GB at that 1,799 price, while the 512GB will be available for 1919 in Obsidian only. To alleviate some of the pain of the price, Google will be offering a free Pixel Watch for everyone who pre-orders the foldable. The May 10 pre-order date is further confirmed from the Google Store, with his source claiming a shipping date of June 27. It will be available May 30 for pre-order from partners like carriers and Best Buy. Into more of the specs, NAME_3’s source claims that both the 256GB and 512GB models, both with UFS 3.1 storage, will have 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM. It will run the Tensor G2 chip with the Titan M2 security chip. Confirming the report from CNBC, the Pixel Fold will weigh 10oz or 283g. Folded, the dimensions are 5.5 height x 3.1 width x 0.5 depth (inches). Unfortunately, there are no dimensions for it unfolded quite yet.

Here we shall explore the meaning of management time as it relates to the interaction between managers and their bosses, their peers, and their subordinates. Specifically, we shall deal with three kinds of management time: Boss-imposed time—used to accomplish those activities that the boss requires and that the manager cannot disregard without direct and swift penalty. System-imposed time—used to accommodate requests from peers for active support. Neglecting these requests will also result in penalties, though not always as direct or swift. Self-imposed time—used to do those things that the manager originates or agrees to do. A certain portion of this kind of time, however, will be taken by subordinates and is called subordinate-imposed time. The remaining portion will be the manager’s own and is called discretionary time. Self-imposed time is not subject to penalty since neither the boss nor the system can discipline the manager for not doing what they didn’t know he had intended to do in the first place. To accommodate those demands, managers need to control the timing and the content of what they do. Since what their bosses and the system impose on them are subject to penalty, managers cannot tamper with those requirements. Thus their self-imposed time becomes their major area of concern. Managers should try to increase the discretionary component of their self-imposed time by minimizing or doing away with the subordinate component. They will then use the added increment to get better control over their boss-imposed and system-imposed activities. Most managers spend much more time dealing with subordinates’ problems than they even faintly realize. Hence we shall use the monkey-on-the-back metaphor to examine how subordinate-imposed time comes into being and what the superior can do about it. Where Is the Monkey? Let us imagine that a manager is walking down the hall and that he notices one of his subordinates, NAME_1, coming his way. When the two meet, NAME_1 greets the manager with, “Good morning. By the way, we’ve got a problem. You see….” As NAME_1 continues, the manager recognizes in this problem the two characteristics common to all the problems his subordinates gratuitously bring to his attention. Namely, the manager knows (a) enough to get involved, but (b) not enough to make the on-the-spot decision expected of him. Eventually, the manager says, “So g","output":"This article discusses the concept of management time and the different types of time that managers deal with: boss-imposed time, system-imposed time, and self-imposed time. Boss-imposed time refers to activities required by the boss that cannot be ignored without penalty. System-imposed time refers to requests from peers for support, which also come with penalties for neglect. Self-imposed time is used for tasks that the manager originates or agrees to do. Some of this time is taken by subordinates, called subordinate-imposed time, while the remaining portion is the manager's discretionary time. The article suggests that managers should try to minimize subordinate-imposed time to increase their discretionary time and gain better control over boss-imposed and system-imposed activities. The article also introduces the concept of the \\"monkey-on-the-back\\" metaphor to explain how subordinate-imposed time arises and what managers can do about it."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following call transcript, think step by step \\"Agent : THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING WITH NAME_1 Customer : NAME_2 HOW ARE YOU Agent : GOOD HOW ARE YOU Customer : I'M GOOD THANK YOU I AM OVER THE PHONE BUT SHE WAS AVAILABLE Agent : YEAH WHAT'S THE CLAIM NUMBER Customer : AWESOME ONE EIGHT ZERO THREE SEVEN TWO SIX TWO SEVEN HUNDRED Agent : FOUR WHERE BODY CORPORATE Customer : YEAH PERFECT AND MY PHONE Agent : ALRIGHT THROUGH Customer : AWESOME THANK YOU Agent : IT'S JUST AN ERROR JUST BUSY AT THE MOMENT I CAN HELP YOU WITH Customer : I'M JUST CALLING ABOUT THE INSURANCE CLAIM YOU'VE GOT THEIR NUMBER OBVIOUSLY Agent : YEAH Customer : YEAH JUST DOUBLE CHECKING WITH THIS ONE NORMALLY WITH YOUR HOURS WE HAVE AN AUTOMATIC APPROVAL AND A HUNDRED SO WE'VE JUST KIND OF DONE THE APPROVAL OF THE CLAIM AND I HAVE CONTACTED THE CONTACT IT'S KATE HER NAME WAS AND SHE JUST SAID THE CLAIM WAS DECLINED SO SHE WAS VERY CONFUSING CALLING SO I JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE CHECK ON YOUR SIDE IF IT IS ACTUALLY IN FACT SORRY Agent : LET ME HAVE A QUICK LOOK FOR YOU YEAH WE'VE WE'VE GOT THE REPORT TODAY CONFUSED AS TO WHY SURE IT'S DECLINED Customer : YEAH SHE SAID SHE GOT LIKE A WELCOME LETTER OR SOMETHING FROM YOU GUYS OR Agent : HAVEN'T MADE CONTACT WITH HER ASTHMA Customer : A FEW DAYS AGO Agent : LET ME HAVE A QUICK LOOK SEE YA Customer : NO Agent : OKAY YEAH BASICALLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS INSURE DOESN'T HAVE CONTENTS INSURANCE K APPARENTLY SHE IS APPROVED YOU TO WRAP BUTTON REMOVED THE CARPET [LAUGHTER] SO APPARENTLY THAT HAVE TO REPLACE THAT PRIVATELY JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE INSURANCE FOR IT Customer : OKAY Agent : AND THEY'RE ALSO AUTHORISE PARTY ON THE POLICY Customer : PAY IT'S NOT AN AUTHORISED PARTY Agent : NO SHE IS Customer : RIGHT OKAY Agent : DO YOU MIND JUST PUTTING LIKE A HOLD ON I'LL TRY AND REACH OUT AND SEE Customer : OKAY Agent : WHAT EXACTLY YOU WANT TO DO Customer : YEAH OF COURSE NO WORRIES AT ALL THANK YOU BYE Agent : I SEE THANK YOU NO WORRIES\\"","output":"The conversation is between an agent (Name_1) and a customer (Name_2).

It's fairly premiums. I'd expect that to work 100 percent of the time and not break easily. The scent I recommend would be quite distinguishable from other sense for similar products in the market. Just something similar, but just a little bit of a different twist to it. There was nothing. I looked at it and thought, don't like the look of that. I've actually looked quite intriguing. There's nothing I would outright say, no, not for me. On the whole, my feelings about it, were quite positive. Like I've said already, it's put on me down to the branding. I don't have an extensive knowledge. However, products of its kind in the market, but the packaging alone intrigued me. There's nothing I'd outright say I disliked about it. Predominantly the packaging, the scent also sounds quite interesting in different. It doesn't look overly different in reality to other products of its kind. But at the same time, the packaging and general feel of it and the scent did make it stand out. That's what I liked about it. I felt good about it. Looking at it, it's just sort of product I would try. It looks slightly different predominantly from the packaging, obviously in the day, cleaning products or cleaning products, but I know you get what you pay for. Overall positive feelings about the product. I think the scent stood out as quite unique, as well as the packaging looked quite cool. In terms of its overall presentation, looking at it alone, I would look at it and go. Just like an intriguing product to try out at least. If I experience this product in real life, I would expect it to be a very fresh smelling, minty fragranced, and quite a stringent, basically non streaky, would actually leave surfaces sparkling clean, no residue, and a lingering freshness. I can't say it's a real dislike. But I thought the actual design of the bottle wasn't striking enough. I can understand that this is a product that is used to sell cleaning products in. It's obviously tried and tested good product. But I thought that if it hadn't been some different style then it would have been more striking and more appealing. I do actually like the packaging of this product. It gives it a clean, fresh, striking look, which is quite appealing. Which is quite different from the general products that are actually on the market at the moment. Overall, I feel indifferent about this product. It is quite eye-catching. Brings your attention to a new product, and if it was on offer than I probably would purchase to try it. But generally, I do buy supermarket brands, own brands because they are cheaper. I'd expect a positive experience as I think dettol is a good brand. I'd consider it to have a pleasant smell, to leave everything smelling fresh and clean. I'd expect the color to be clear. I don't expect it to spray easily even when you're down to the last bit in the bottle, spray out a good distance, I would say. I don't think there is anything that I actually dislike about it. It does what I wanted to do. I think as cleaning products go. It's got a good sense. Yeah, I can't think of anything that I dislike. I liked the products. I felt like it's a brand that I trust. I think it has a pleasant smell for a cleaning products. I like that it kills 99.9 percent of bacteria as well. I think it does what I want it to do, it clean surfaces nicely. Yeah, I liked the product and it does what I wanted to do, is good at cleaning my surfaces, has pleasant smell. I like this as it kills 99.9% of bacteria. I feel it's brand that I trust. I think why I go for Dettol just because I think of it as a good brand for cleaning products. I think normally I always go for a spray that kills 99.9% of bacteria. That was one of the reasons I picked it. I think it says that kills cold and flu viruses. It's not really why I picked it, but I would say that it stands out. I think it was the colors, the green and the white that stood out for me with the packaging. The bottle was just basically the same as general household cleaning products. But the actual colors and the design did give it a good, fresh, clean look. I would expect it to be powerful to work quickly. I'd expect it to really be a lot different with other products because debtor was more of a household brands. I'd expect better results as other brands. I wasn't sure if the coloring like the green was for mold or if it's meant to be an EcoColors in between so I wasn't really sure what that's for also, it looks like something that looks fine at the front but could have a lot of chemicals in it. I think sometimes things try and make themselves seem to be less chemically than they are but other than that, it all seem fine. If I purchase this product in real life, I would hope that it would work just like other sprays that I have, especially the normal that all antibacterial spray that I use. I would like it to be a clear spray. I imagine there might be a slight green or yellow colour into it because of the flavor. I would like it to be clean. I would like it to smell really fresh, without being too strong because they wouldn't want that to add perfume to any surfaces or any of the kids toys that I might be cleaning. I would just like it to be the same height and same size as other bottles I have as well. Just at first sight, the only thing I didn't really like, and I've already mentioned this, is that the flavor of the bottle or the fragrance of the bottle was really small print at the bottom. When I want to buy a product, I like to know what exactly the fragrance is and it's probably the first thing I will look at because I am quite fussy about smells, I don't like for example really floral smells. Best one I would have chosen a way because it has such easy, but that' s the only thing I would say about it. This product is antibacterial. Having small children in the house, I think it's important to have everything sanitised and as hygienic as possible. I also like that it looks like a good shape of a bottle with the spray. That it's nice, and slim as well, because, I have a lot of pain and products on my cupboard under the sink. It looks it would slow and really well with the rest of them. I think I would definitely buy this if it was on the shelf in front of me. I would be very interested. If I purchased this product in real life, I would expect it to obviously do its job. I will expect it to have a pleasant smell and not too toxic because I know something's smelt quite toxic and unpleasant and I expect it to be quite colorful like green or yellow or white, see-through whitish. I'd expect to spray quite good. No issues and quite a lot out at once. Because I know some bottles when you spray, you have to spend multiple times to get something out. Yeah. I don't think there's anything that I dislike about the product because I think the packaging and what it says on there, I think it's all fine and not really what I dislike. I think there's more things that I like about the product and dislikes. I'd say there's nothing I can say to this question that I dislike.","output":"Key themes: 1. Packaging and branding 2.

Before learning other coping mechanisms, their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to emotional isolation, self-injury or suicidal behavior. They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, shut them down entirely since awareness would only cause further distress. This can be harmful since negative emotions alert people to the presence of a problematic situation and move them to address it. Treatment of bipolar disorder Forms of stress may include having too much to do, too much complexity and conflicting demands among others. There are also stresses that come from the absence of elements such as human contact, a sense of achievement, constructive creative outlets, and occasions or circumstances that will naturally elicit positive emotions.Antidepressant Antidepressants provide a modest-to-moderate reduction in anxiety in GAD. The efficacy of different antidepressants is similar.Coping Research has shown that everyone has personal healthy coping strategies (self-soothing, relaxation distraction), however, access to social and professional support varies. Increasing distress and inadequate support results in the additional use of unhealthy coping strategies. Overwhelming distress exceeds the capacity of healthy coping strategies and results in the use of unhealthy coping strategies. Overwhelming distress is caused by problems in one or more biopsychosocial domains of health and wellbeing. The continuum of coping strategies (healthy to unhealthy, independent to social, and low harm to high harm) have been explored in general populations, university students, and paramedics.","output":"There is a connection between stress management techniques and depression, but this relationship can vary depending on the individual's background and severity of the condition. People with borderline personality disorder are particularly sensitive to negative emotions, and their attempts to manage or escape from these feelings may lead to emotional isolation, self-injury, or suicidal behavior. These individuals may not be able to regulate their negative emotions and instead shut them down, which can be harmful for identifying a problem and taking steps to address it. The treatment of bipolar disorder may involve addressing various forms of stress, including those resulting from lack of interaction with others, lack of accomplishment, and lack of positive events.

Shad and I met with Peter Bloom in La Jolla (San Diego) last week. Pete has been involved in a number of various energy projects over the years and he and I share an interest in antique heavy equipment (this is where I met him). After our meeting, Pete summarized our discussions - see his email below. I'm sharing this with you because in a way, Pete's email forms the skeleton of a business plan for R&R. He captured the main topics we discussed but we need to separate those major topics into their own \\"stand alone\\" business plans.  For now considering your present assignment, let's focus on utility work in the USA only. We can look at the other items later on.  A couple of weeks ago, Alan and I developed a budget identifying the \\"cost of doing business\\" should we move to Texas or California. This summarizes the expenditures we'd expect such as personnel salaries, office rental, vehicles, etc. We did a three year forecast of these costs to see how much money we would need to operate a company down in the USA. This was a rather \\"crude\\" estimate in that all we did was multiply the rate or cost of an item by the number of units or hours. With respect to the number of hours that a person would contribute, we simply assumed two categories. One is where a person would have full time involvement and therefore would consume 2,080 hours, which is considered to be standard work year (40 hours a week x 52 weeks a year). The other is where they would have part-time involvement and in this case, we assumed they would only work half a year or 1,040 hours. Given more time, we need to refine this estimate a bit more. The main purpose of this budget was to seek financial assistance in the form of a business loan so we were \\"conservative\\" in our numbers in this estimate. In reality, our actual costs would likely be less but for the purposes of this budget (where we were seeking as much money as we could get), we went slightly overboard with our numbers. Knowing our costs, we now need to figure out how much revenue we could earn. How we earn revenue is by undertaking projects. So, what I asked Steven to do initially was some desktop research to identify potential projects in the Texas market that we'd be qualified to bid on - specifically, high voltage transmission line work. These could be found by searching various local utility websites. I think there are maybe six major utilities in Texas - like AEP Texas, CenterPoint Energy, Oncor Electric, Texas - New Mexico Power, etc. Projects should be listed on these (or similar) websites along with other information such as schedule (when they are expected to be built), estimated value, etc. After you collect this information, we'll then summarize it on a spreadsheet and assess the value of what we expect our portion of this work would be. After you gather all this information on the spreadsheet, we'll have what we need to complete our business plan and answer the questions Pete asks in his email. And from your research, we'll assume that we earn X million in revenue per year less Y million in expenses and the balance should be a positive number that represents our profit. I hope this makes sense. For now, just see what you can do by identifying potential clients (utility companies) in Texas, their project list, the value of these projects and when they're expected to be built.

Direct utility estimation can be used in situations where the environment is stochastic, meaning that the outcomes of actions are not deterministic, and the rewards associated with those outcomes are uncertain. In such cases, the expected utility of an action is used to make decisions that maximize the expected cumulative reward over time.

Even more jarring, these numbers account for only first-time downloads and exclude re-installs and installed updates to these same applications. This type of hyper-growth was fueled, in part, by the global pandemic. As a result, developers had to push out new apps to meet these unique environmental demands, as well as new features and improvements to account for the change in the way day-to-day tasks were to be completed. With such fast-paced development, it left the door open for a reduction in quality leading to self-inflicted issues or room for a third party to gain unauthorized access to systems and information. Unfortunately, a number of high notoriety apps proved this to be true. Let’s take a look at how prevalent these types of breaches are, what the attack vectors were, and how you can better secure your apps moving forward. How prevalent are mobile security threats? One of the largest corporate team collaboration tools, Slack, fell victim to a data breach. A bug within their “Shared Invite Link” was found to be transmitting a hashed version of the user’s password. While Slack denied that clear-text versions of the password were made accessible, they forced those affected customers to reset their passwords and wipe app data logs.  Users of a mobile banking and payment app by Klarna found themselves confused as they were briefly exposed to different users’ account information. Given the nature of potentially sensitive information being shared, the company had to lock down the service until the issue was rectified.  Apple and Google found themselves in hot water as well with flaws found in iMessage and 13 popular Android apps, respectively. The iMessage flaw exposed all of its 900 million active users to spyware granting access to the device owner’s photos, messages, personal data, and location. The Android apps’ issues exposed personal data including, emails, chat messages, passwords, and photos of as many as 100 million users.  Even a private Canadian COVID vaccination passport app, Portpass, found itself in harm’s way when ineffective data storage led to personal unencrypted data being made accessible in plaintext. Hackers were able to gain access to the data of 650,000 users. As the number of devices and app downloads skyrockets year-over-year, the attack surface expands along with it. Mobile application security threats have never been more prevalent. What are the common attack vectors? The data breaches outlined in the previous section highlight how important it is for developers to remain vigilant in their coding practices. Organizations such as The OWASP Foundation work to improve the security of software and bring to light common vulnerabilities, including those found in mobile applications. Alongside the list of popular risks are the associated attack vectors, security weaknesses, technical and business impacts, as well as information on whether you may have such a vulnerability and how you may go about protecting against it. The breaches outlined above fell perfectly into some of the OWASP Top 10 mobile risks buckets: M2: Insecure Data Storage – Portpass app M3: Insecure Communication – Google apps M5: Insufficient Cryptography – Slack app M7: Client Code Quality – Klarna banking and payment app M8: Code Tampering – Apple iMessage Just from these few examples, we can see how commonplace some of these risks are. Five of the top 10 are showcased in these apps alone. Many more fall victim to these issues, as well as the remaining five. It’s critical for every developer to familiarize themselves with these mobile risks to ensure they’re well-equipped to build and release secure applications. How can you ensure your apps are secure? The most proactive approach development teams can take is to get their code audited. There are professionals out there who assist in identifying these vulnerabilities so you can address them before they become catastrophic. If any issues are found, taking immediate action to rectify them is crucial. Teams will need to strategize ways to best mitigate these risks. This could involve looking inward to the internal development team for fixes and improvements, or it may mean seeking external solutions where subject matter experts handle the problem via their services. Ionic’s Enterprise SDK is just one example of how invaluable a trusted external partner can be to your development team. Ionic’s professional support and advisory services ensure teams reach their goals, avoid technical debt, increase performance, and improve their mobile app’s security.  Ongoing security training and keeping the development team up to date on best practices are effective strategies for keeping apps secure. An informed team is better positioned to make reactive, as well as proactive, decisions on mobile app security risks.

The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law, or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of computation. Most AI research has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent were constant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an improvement that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation. These two need not run counter to each other, but in practice they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other. There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other. And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation.  There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson, and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent. In computer chess, the methods that defeated the world champion, Kasparov, in 1997, were based on massive, deep search. At the time, this was looked upon with dismay by the majority of computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that leveraged human understanding of the special structure of chess. When a simpler, search-based approach with special hardware and software proved vastly more effective, these human-knowledge-based chess researchers were not good losers. They said that \`\`brute force\\" search may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy, and anyway it was not how people played chess. These researchers wanted methods based on human input to win and were disappointed when they did not. A similar pattern of research progress was seen in computer Go, only delayed by a further 20 years. Enormous initial efforts went into avoiding search by taking advantage of human knowledge, or of the special features of the game, but all those efforts proved irrelevant, or worse, once search was applied effectively at scale. Also important was the use of learning by self play to learn a value function (as it was in many other games and even in chess, although learning did not play a big role in the 1997 program that first beat a world champion). Learning by self play, and learning in general, is like search in that it enables massive computation to be brought to bear. Search and learning are the two most important classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI research. In computer Go, as in computer chess, researchers' initial effort was directed towards utilizing human understanding (so that less search was needed) and only much later was much greater success had by embracing search and learning. In speech recognition, there was an early competition, sponsored by DARPA, in the 1970s. Entrants included a host of special methods that took advantage of human knowledge---knowledge of words, of phonemes, of the human vocal tract, etc. On the other side were newer methods that were more statistical in nature and did much more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Again, the statistical methods won out over the human-knowledge-based methods. This led to a major change in all of natural language processing, gradually over decades, where statistics and computation came to dominate the field. The recent rise of deep learning in speech recognition is the most recent step in this consistent direction. Deep learning methods rely even less on human knowledge, and use even more computation, together with learning on huge training sets, to produce dramatically better speech recognition systems. As in the games, researchers always tried to make systems that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked---they tried to put that knowledge in their systems---but it proved ultimately counterproductive, and a colossal waste of researcher's time, when, through Moore's law, massive computation became available and a means was found to put it to good use. In computer vision, there has been a similar pattern. Early methods conceived of vision as searching for edges, or generalized cylinders, or in terms of SIFT features. But today all this is discarded. Modern deep-learning neural networks use only the notions of convolution and certain kinds of invariances, and perform much better. This is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes. To see this, and to effectively resist it, we have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach. One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning. The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.","output":"1.

Some common symptoms include trembling or twitching, heart palpitations, and physical complaints such as stomach aches, headaches, and general aches and pains in the body. Notice if you have any of these symptoms and think back to when they started. Did the symptoms begin around a stressful time in your life? This may be related to stress response syndrome. You might feel nervous or tense, or find yourself crying frequently. Other symptoms include depression, anxiety, worry, and tension. You could also feel hopeless, sad, or helpless. You may also withdraw from people or social events or isolate yourself from others frequently.  Notice major shifts in your emotional functioning as related to stressors in your life. Did any emotional symptoms occur right after the event? Did they come gradually over the first months after an event? Emotional symptoms can onset immediately or over time. Some people experience behavioral changes as a result of experiencing distress. You may experience impulsive behavior such as impromptu shopping trips. Or you may experience defiant behavior, such as not wanting to follow directions or listen to authority. Children and teens may experience behavior changes more often than adults, and may act out their feelings. This can include skipping school, engaging in fights, or other negative behaviors. summary: Identify triggers of stress response syndrome. Be aware of physical symptoms. Look for emotional symptoms. Notice any changes in behavior.  Summarize the following: Begin with dry, clean hair. Carefully brush your hair until it is smooth. Pay particular attention to removing any snarls or knots in your long locks. Bend forward at your waist. Brush your hair forwards towards your forehead. Gather your hair into a ponytail at the base of your forehead. Secure it tightly with a rubber band. Imagine that you are transforming your hair into a unicorn’s horn. The ponytail should be located in the same place as a unicorn’s horn. Remain bent over at your waist. Slowly slide your rubber band towards the ends of your hair. Stop 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm)  from the ends of your hair. Adjust the rubber band to the desired length—remember, it is always better to cut a little bit off at a time! Position your non-dominant hand securely over the rubberband. As you stand up straight, try not to shift your hair or the position of your hand. Using a pair of sharp shears, cut just below the rubber band. Set down the hair you cut off, remove the ponytail holder, and assess your layered look. If you want to cut more hair off, repeat the process. After you remove the ponytail holder, make sure to check you layers for evenness. If you notice any areas that are uneven, use a pair of scissors to clean them up. Be sure to look in a mirror as you do this. summary: Prep your hair. Brush your hair into a ponytail. Position the rubber band. Cut your hair.  Summarize the following: French kissing, or kissing with tongue, is a common way of sharing intimacy with a partner. Slip your tongue across his lips and touch his tongue gently, but don’t shove your tongue into his mouth. If you start making out while you're standing up or you're sitting in an uncomfortable spot, it's okay to take a break to move somewhere more comfortable. Try sitting on a couch or a bed where you'll have room to get cozy together. As you’re kissing, you can show him that you want to move from simple kisses to making out by pressing your body against his. The heightened physical contact will lead to a feeling of deeper intimacy. Don’t just leave your hands laying by your sides or in your lap! Run your hands across his chest or along his upper arms, or rest your hand on the side of his neck. If you take a break from kissing, keep your hands busy by playing with his shirt or his hair. The neck is a very sensitive area, so don’t be afraid to kiss along his throat or behind his ears. Take the time to whisper something sexy while you’re kissing close to his ears! Try saying something like, “I’m really enjoying this” or “You’re so sexy.” Stop for a breather every so often, especially if you don't want things to get too hot and heavy. Play with his hair, touch his face, or play with his fingers while you catch your breath. If you don't want things to progress past making out, you should know your limits and stop making out before it goes too far. When you're ready to end the make out session, slow your kisses and gradually stop.  Never let anyone pressure you to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you want to stop kissing, the other person should stop, even if you were the one who initiated the kiss. Just because he seems aroused doesn't mean he's ready to have sex. If you do want to go further, talk to him about what he wants, and make sure you don't pressure him if he wants to stop.","output":"Summary: French kissing is a way to share intimacy with a partner. Start with gentle tongue contact and avoid shoving your tongue into their mouth. Find a comfortable spot to make out and use your hands to touch their body. Kiss their neck and whisper something sexy. Take breaks and set boundaries. Always prioritize your comfort and communicate with your partner."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following news article in one sentence.

What was it and how did you handle it? Knowing what you know now, would you do anything differently?  - 2020. We wanted to create a new product - a platform for the developers and data science.  - They were two different approaches. Stand alone product. The other approach was to enhance the main product to enable...  Q: What was the problem you were trying to solve?  - we have our main product .. [tech details]  - we want to develop algo that find bugs.  - I thought it's not a good idea to build a new product and we can gain much more if we can build on top of the existing product.  - One of my peers thought differently because he thought he can do it faster. He also underestimated the size work.  - After several discussions my manager decided to go with my peer approach.  - unfortunately, the approach selected encountered a lot of problem. and we had to do the entire cycle.  - once I got the management of the entire product (2021) was to create a vision of one product.  Q: who did you disagree with?  - I thought we won't be able to deliver the new product approach in 10 weeks.  - [hand waving]  - I thought my manager had interest to retain my peer.

They disagreed with their peer and manager about the approach to creating a new product for developers and data science. The candidate believed in enhancing the existing product rather than creating a standalone one, arguing that it would mitigate main risks and be more beneficial in the long run. Despite their disagreement, the manager decided to proceed with the peer's approach, which unfortunately encountered numerous problems and required a complete redo.  The candidate felt that the decision was influenced by the manager's desire to retain the peer, who would have been unhappy if his approach was not chosen. The candidate tried to convince the manager by explaining their perspective, but in hindsight, they would have also proposed a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate the feasibility of their approach.  When the candidate took over the product management in 2021, they implemented their vision of a unified product. They also expressed that they would have acted differently in the face of project failure, suggesting that they should have cut their losses and tried their approach instead of investing more resources into the failing one.  Overall, the candidate showed a willingness to disagree when they believed it was in the best interest of the business, and a commitment to the chosen course of action, even when it was not their preferred approach.

Reports say targets include U.S. Commerce Secretary NAME_1, U.S. State Department officials and other organizations not yet publicly revealed. Microsoft disclosed the incident last Tuesday, attributing the month-long activity to a newly discovered espionage group it calls Storm-0558, which it believes has a strong nexus to China.

While the U.S. government has not publicly attributed the hacks, China’s top foreign ministry spokesperson denied the allegations on Wednesday. Where China has used previously unknown vulnerabilities to individually hack into Microsoft-powered email servers to steal corporate data, this hacking group instead went directly to the source by targeting new and undisclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s cloud. In its blog post, Microsoft said the hackers acquired one of its consumer signing keys, or MSA key, which the company uses to secure consumer email accounts, like for accessing Outlook.com. Microsoft said it initially thought the hackers were forging authentication tokens using an acquired enterprise signing key, which are used to secure corporate and enterprise email accounts. But, Microsoft found that the hackers were using that consumer MSA key to forge tokens that allowed them to break into enterprise inboxes. Microsoft said this was because of a “validation error in Microsoft code.”","output":"Microsoft is still investigating how hackers obtained a Microsoft signing key to break into dozens of email inboxes, including those belonging to federal government agencies.

It is commonly referenced as a theory, a methodology, a set of instruments, sometimes even a philosophy to guide and support creative technical activities with systematic means. Introduction of TRIZ:  Origins of Classical TRIZ:  TRIZ is a theory for solving problems during the inventive process. It provides a set of instruments which dramatically decrease the amount of trial-and-errors when a problem situation requires creativity and invention in order to be solved.

The distance between sadness and joy, between good and bad fortune, seemed to be much greater than for us; every experience had that degree of directness and absoluteness that joy and sadness still have in the mind of a child. Every event, every deed was defined in given and expressive forms and was in accord with the solemnity of a tight, invariable life style. The great events of human life—birth, marriage, death—by virtue of the sacraments, basked in the radiance of the divine mystery. But even the lesser events—a journey, labor, a visit—were accompanied by a multitude of blessings, ceremonies, sayings, and conventions. There was less relief available for misfortune and for sickness; they came in a more fearful and more painful way. Sickness contrasted more strongly with health. The cutting cold and the dreaded darkness of winter were more concrete evils. Honor and wealth were enjoyed more fervently and greedily because they contrasted still more than now with lamentable poverty. A fur-lined robe of office, a bright fire in the oven, drink and jest, and a soft bed still possessed that high value for enjoyment that perhaps the English novel, in describing the joy of life, has affirmed over the longest period of time. In short, all things in life had about them something glitteringly and cruelly public. The lepers, shaking their rattles and holding processions, put their deformities openly on display. Every estate, order, and craft could be recognized by its dress. The notables, never appearing without the ostentatious display of their weapons and liveried servants, inspired awe and envy. The administration of justice, the sales of goods, weddings and funerals—all announced themselves through processions, shouts, lamentations and music. The lover carried the emblem of his lady, the member the insignia of his fraternity, the party the colors and coat of arms of its lord. In their external appearance, too, town and countryside displayed the same contrast and color. The city did not dissipate, as do our cities, into carelessly fashioned, ugly factories and monotonous country homes, but, enclosed by its walls, presented a completely rounded picture that included its innumerable protruding towers. No matter how high and weighty the stone houses of the noblemen or merchants may have been, churches with their proudly rising masses of stone, dominated the city silhouettes. Just as the contrast","output":"The text describes a time when the world was half a thousand years younger, where experiences and events had sharper distinctions and were more intense. Life was filled with rituals, ceremonies, and conventions, even for minor events. Misfortune and sickness were more feared, and the contrast between health and illness, wealth and poverty, was more pronounced. Enjoyments were more fervently appreciated due to their stark contrast with hardship. Society was more public, with people's status and professions clearly displayed through their attire and behavior. The administration of justice, sales, weddings, and funerals were all public events. Cities were enclosed, with distinct and colorful architecture, dominated by the towering structures of churches. The text suggests a world of heightened contrasts and public displays, where life was lived more intensely and publicly."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following text:  You are currently calling number 2, waiting to speak with a representative.

affected when I speak I'm moving my hands but I'm also moving some of my body she wasn't doing that I do a newscast in Spanish now let's see how it does with the Spanish newscast on incendio Forrestal ha effectado una Grand Park de la region it sucked in Spanish she actually threw in some Spanglish there miles to Hector is and the accent I have Casado she definitely struggled there the AI cannot take my job for now I'm a bartender surprise me with a Twist on a Negroni and give it a name fill a mixing glass with ice add the Gin Campari and sweet vermouth gently muddle two to three fresh Sage leaves in the glass stir the mixture until well chilled Express the orange peel over the drink release the oils and use it as a garnish there you go you have your Sage Negroni so it's a good classic Negroni I'm not really getting sage just adding the sage leaves was not very creative AI didn't ask me any follow-up questions I would say what do you like is there a style of gin that you like I think if you want to have a truly bespoke cocktail you gotta go see a bartender I'm a screenwriter I'm going to give this AI a prompt that describes a scene in my latest movie and to see how well it can match it in this scene set in 1949 three World War II widows toast their younger sister Ruby's wedding exterior Beach day Mildred Shirley and Charlotte Frolic at the shoreline of the beach and may you never have to experience the Heartbreak that we did the character literally says exactly what like you want the story to do what's going on Ruby seems tense I don't know but I'm going to find out just very on the nose dialogue there's a lot of parentheticals describing how the characters saying the Line This is a screenwriter no no you start to tip into the director's territory I think that AI can help with my my job in conceptual brainstorming playing out scene ideas if you get stuck on a scene but overall I don't think AI can do my job I'm a music producer I'm writing a song for a pop client please write this song and include chords for the guitar the client is heavily influenced by Lana Del Rey it looks like we've gotten a chord structure and some lyrics a typical progression so not too interesting but that's okay so let's make a beat when I work with an artist that's looking for a specific influence I'll think about the BPM that that artist usually goes for [Applause] okay this is pretty good it's a good start another great day in the city I'm feeling lost oh Such a Pity City Lights and heartbeats you walk in and make me complete I like that it's a starting point of course some of the lyrics are super corny I will admit a lot of the time that's how it starts for me right now these programs can't do my job I'm a journalist I'm the reviews editor at wired and I test products for a living so I asked chat gbt to write a review of a product that I've actually written about in the style of my own writing when it comes to electric skateboards there are plenty of options to choose from a little boring this is pulling in data specifically from my review and so it has a lot of similar characteristics and sentences that I might typically use unfortunately I think it's Stripped Away a lot of the personality in the original review it kind of just took a lot of the basic details and spit out this thing that is kind of generic as for things that did right it actually brought out a lot of these specs like the 3000 watt Motors the 26 miles per hour speeds when reading this review it almost sounds like I could have written it by just reading a press release the AI cannot physically handle this product it's not exactly testing the product itself at that point can you really trust where the source is coming from asking chat gbt to write a review based in my voice is definitely weird I'm a circus artist what would I ask the AI to do hmm I don't think there's anything that I can think of that I would have the AI do for me I'm a copywriter McDonald's just went 100 vegan write several taglines so we've got veganize your taste buds today feels like a used car salesman no animals harmed only flavor enhanced I don't ever go to a fast food restaurant and say I really want my flavor enhanced that's not something I'm ever looking for our last one here is wow very short we've got It's Time to Go Green did it run out of um words it typed up some general ideas which actually could help if you were brainstorming and you're like I have nothing at all AI could do my job at a very like a Monday morning no coffee kind of way if you wanted to pay no money and get a bad product sure hey I could do my job I'm a personal trainer please design a fat burning weekly at home workout plan this is definitely a typical plan that someone might want to burn calories with a full body workout you're also doing some type of pull workout that's going to work your back your posterior chain and you're also doing some kind of push so I will say that I like that that it's giving a full range of those types of exercises most people know what a push-up is but do they know how to correctly do a push-up it's saying three sets of eight to ten reps but how much time is in between each set ideally you would want to be able to see the client in person or on a virtual call so that you can see what their form looks like I don't think AI can do my job I'm a DJ I have my radio show coming up I play uplifting disco music for about two hours make a full playlist slash set list for my show it's hitting the Disco on the head for sure I've played a few of these artists on my show before so it's definitely getting pretty close to maybe what a tracklist would be one of these tracks Gotta Keep On by sweet cream I looked it up and there's no trace of it on the internet anywhere where did it get this song from does the song actually exist AI can make a playlist being able to look out into a room and look out into a dance floor and say okay people are tired let me match that energy I don't think that it can do that based on what I've seen I'm a voice actor shouldn't cost the Earth we've created a new line of compostable shoes that are made from sustainable materials I've asked the AI to read this copy let's hear this thing fashion shouldn't cost the Earth we've crew line of compostable hey but not great it's very computer-like it has a strange Cadence and so it ends every sentence like this sustainable which is not the way a human talks it can't change on the Fly is there a joke that I'm supposed to get in the next line it doesn't understand all those things the things that come from like life experiences it's never going to be like the thing that you're going to use for like McDonald's commercials it's going to be like the things that no one really likes to do anyway like 400 hours of instruction manuals or something like that can AI do my job kinda but not really well although it still freaks me out I'm an influencer and I want to know if AI can do my job I want chat gbt to help me with an IG caption that's a picture of me smiling standing at the top of my Matra in Paris Standing On Top of the World or at least on top of mamatra smiley face eyes the view from here is breathtaking the Sakura cord in my back reminding me of the city's Rich history and culture feeling grateful and inspired what a day it has been hashtag grateful this is like really strong but it doesn't necessarily capture how I would speak my audience would know that this is not me probably from the overwhelming amount of emojis I would probably say like hey y'all or like sis that was amazing this AI program cannot do my job but it's very close I'm a chef write a recipe for an Indian restaurant meal include a protein marination it's got definitely a lot of spices that you use in Indian cooking it's actually missing a key component it didn't include yogurt which kind of acts as a binding agent 400 Degrees 20 to 25 minutes for chicken it would probably dry it out overall I would say it's like a nice 8 out of 10 dish I do think a substantial part of being a chef is that creativity and coming up with dishes so in terms of that aspect of the job I think AI comes dangerously close to being able to do my job I'm a translator please translate the opening paragraph of The Sun Also Rises into Korean structural sentence pretty good but there are so many mistakes like if you see the second sentence this is wrong translation in Korean we have casual form and then also respectful form this AI translation use basic written form in first sentence but in the second sentence he used like respect for form it's not consistent AI cannot do my job maybe someday it can do it but so far it's like it made so many mistakes I'm a firefighter there's no way AI can do my job [Music]\\"","output":"The video \\"(2) A.I. Tries 20 Jobs | WIRED - YouTube\\" explores the capabilities of AI in performing various jobs. The jobs tested include software engineer, doctor, graphic designer, relationship therapist, stand-up comedian, lawyer, news anchor, bartender, screenwriter, music producer, product reviewer, circus artist, copywriter, personal trainer, DJ, voice actor, influencer, chef, translator, and firefighter. In each job, the AI was given a task related to the profession. For instance, as a software engineer, it was asked to generate code for a website. As a doctor, it was asked to diagnose a patient based on symptoms. As a graphic designer, it was asked to rebrand the McDonald's logo as vegan.  The results varied across professions. In some cases, the AI performed well, providing useful outputs like generating code or providing a diagnosis. However, in many cases, the AI fell short, lacking the human touch, creativity, or nuanced understanding required for the job. For example, as a therapist, the AI provided generic advice that lacked personalization. As a comedian, the AI's joke was deemed cute but not particularly funny.  In conclusion, while AI has made significant strides and can assist in various tasks, it is not yet capable of fully replacing humans in most of these professions. The AI's performance was generally seen as a good starting point or a tool for brainstorming, but it lacked the depth, creativity, and personal touch that a human professional brings to their job."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following.

[ __ ] out of me what's your people what do you mean your favorite people you whack your routers what have you done yeah super interesting and fascinating language models I don't know if you know what those are but that's the general uh systems that uh on July child GPT and GPT they've been progressing over the past maybe four years aggressively there's been a lot of development GPT one gpt2 gpt3 uh gbt 3.5 and Chad gbt there's a lot of interesting technical stuff that maybe we don't want to get into sure let's get into it well I'm fascinated by it it's a Chad GPT is based on fundamentally on a 175 billion uh parameter neural network that is gpt3 and the rest is what data is it trained on and how is it trained so you already have like a brain a giant neural network and it's just trained in different ways so Chad uh GPT 3 came out about two years ago and it was like impressive but dumb in a lot of ways it was like you would expect as a human being for it to generate certain kinds of text and it was like saying kind of dumb things that were off and you're like all right this is really impressive but it's not quite there you can tell it's not intelligent and what they did with uh GPT 3. 5 is they started adding more and different kinds of data sets there one of them probably the smartest neural network currently is codex which is fine-tuned for programming like it was it was uh trained on code on programming code and when you train a programming code which chat GPT is also you're teaching it something like reasoning because it's no longer information and knowledge from the Internet it's also reasoning you can like logic even though you're looking at code programming code is you're looking at me like what the [ __ ] is he talking about no no no no that's not what I'm looking at I'm looking at you like oh my God but reasoning is a in order to be able to stitch together sentences that make sense you not only need to know the facts that on July those sentences you also have to be able to reason yeah and we think of it we take it for granted as human beings that we can do some common sense reasoning like like this war started at this date and ended at this date therefore it means that uh like the start and the end has a meaning there's a temporal consistency there's a cause and effect all of those things are inside programming code by the way a lot of stuff I'm saying we still don't understand we're like intuiting why this works so well really these are the intuitions yeah there's a lot of stuff they're not clear so Chad so GPT 3. 5 which Chad GPT is likely based on there's no paper yet so we don't know exactly the the details but it was just trained on on code and more data that's able to give it some reasoning then this is really important it was fine-tuned in a supervised Way by human labeling small data set by human labeling of here's what we would like this network to generate here's the stuff that makes sense here's the kind of dialogue that makes sense here's the kind of answers to questions that make sense it's basically pointing this giant Titanic of a neural network into the right direction that aligns with the way human beings think and talk so it's not just using the giant wisdom of uh Wikipedia and just I can talk about what data sets this train on but just basically the internet it was pointed in the wrong direction so this uh supervised labeling allows it to point in the right direction to when it says [ __ ] you're like holy [ __ ] that's pretty smart so that that's the alignment and then they did uh something really interesting is using reinforcement learning uh based on labeling data from humans this that's quite a large data set the task is the following you have this smart DPT 3.5 thing generate a bunch of text and humans label which one seems the best so ranking like you ask it a question of for example you could do uh generate a joke in a style of Joe Rogan right and you have a label that has five options and you have a label as I mentioned dick and [ __ ] I don't know how exactly but uh so you get it to rank the the human label is just over just sitting there there's a very large number of them they're working full-time they're labeling the ranking of the outputs of this model and that kind of ranking used together with a technique called reinforcement learning is able to get this thing to generate very impressive to humans output so it's not actually there's not a significant breakthrough in how much knowledge was learned that was already in gpt3 and there was much more impressive models already trained so it's on the way not just open AI but this kind of fighting fine tuning is called by human labelers plus reinforcement learning you start to get like like where uh students don't have to write essays anymore in high school yeah where you can style transfer like I said uh do a uh Louis CK joke install Joe Rogan or Joe Joe Rogan joke and the style of Lucy K and does an incredible job at those kinds of style transfers you can uh more accurately query things about the different historical events all that kind of stuff how far away are we from something like chat GPT being impossible to detect whether or not it's a person or whether it's chat GPT well it depends who is playing with it I think we're not that far away in terms of capability but in order to use these systems and rather in order to train these systems you have to be a large company and large companies tend to get scared when it's doing interesting stuff really well they tend to want to even currently with chat GPT it's become a lot less interesting interesting spoken in a Bukowski Hunter S Thompson kind of interesting because the companies are kind of censoring it you don't want it to have any kind of controversial opinions you don't want it to be too edgy you don't want it to be real too like if I ask it how do I build the bomb because I want to destroy the world we wanted to prevent that how about how do I uh uh I don't know convince I don't know anything about this but how do I convince a dude or a girl to sleep with me and go like anything I'm just off the top of my head anything you start to get nervous imagine if you're a company how do I want people to use this kind of system right especially because it's basically an assistant that gives you wisdom about the world gives you knowledge about the world you can be like how do I replace a carburetor yeah that's great\\"","output":"Joe Rogan is discussing the latest advancements in language models, specifically Chat GPT, with Lex Fridman. Joe is fascinated by the capabilities of these models, which are trained on large datasets of text and can generate human-like language. He notes that Chat GPT 3.5, which is likely based on a 175 billion parameter neural network, has been fine-tuned for programming and can reason in a way that is similar to human thinking. Joe explains that the model is trained on a supervised way by human labeling of small data sets, which allows it to generate sentences that make sense and can answer questions in a way that is similar to human reasoning. He also mentions that reinforcement learning is used to train the model, which involves ranking the outputs of the model based on human labeling. Joe then discusses the potential capabilities of these models, such as generating jokes in the style of comedians, accurately querying historical events, and even potentially replacing human assistants. However, he notes that large companies may be hesitant to use these models due to concerns about controversial opinions or edgy content. Overall, Joe is impressed by the progress being made in language models and the potential they have to revolutionize the way we interact with technology."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following.

five-day window today comes to the conclusion of this new moon portal that is still open now why is it important that we start to recognize some of the things here today is because if you look at how your energies have been over the past few days it's highly likely that you will be able to resonate with number one your emotions have been a little bit vibrant it's been a little bit Amplified because that new moon is there it's charging it's activating your Energies number two it's highly likely that you've had certain desires some desires may be that you haven't thought about for a long time or some things that you know remind you of your big dream your big goal your big why and sometimes it's a wild Dream It's A Wild goal right it's a miracle of a manifestation sometimes it can even feel a little bit overwhelming right so these ideas and this imagination this creativity especially with this new moon in Pisces is going to be very apparent for a lot of people and the third thing that I see is that there will be also a lot of doubts and a lot of fears a little bit of anxiety or stress or overwhelm because the things are too strong too powerful too wild too out there that your mind cannot gather its thoughts to how you can actually make it happen and therefore it equates to overwhelm and stress and maybe an element of doubt and fear if you can resonate with any of these things do let us know inside the comments below so that at least it helps other people who are on this journey of Awakening of expanding their Consciousness to also understand that they are not alone right we are all in this together with the collective consciousness and so while this is happening what is very important for us to establish during this time well number one I think it's very important for us to work on grounding our Energies do some practices go out in nature have your Barefoot on ground on grass right be close to trees breathe inhale exhale in our personal practices ground those energies when you feel a little bit light-headed so much overwhelm here breathe in through the crown and exhale out down through the root chakra and into the core of the universe into the core of the Earth because that's allows our energies to ground and feel more peace more powerful allows for a little bit more certainty Builds on those foundations so I think grounding is going to be a very important practice during this time so try to do it today if you can do some practices the second thing allow yourself for scripting get that manifestation Journal out allow yourself to go wild with that scripting go absolutely Wild right allow that crazy dream of yours that crazy uh what may be unimaginable law may even sometimes feel a little bit unachievable that goal allow yourself to script it out and when you script it out observe it look at it and ask yourself this question where does this desire where does this feeling where does this imagination where does it all come from because if it's unimaginable or it seems to be too overwhelming let me tell you something it's not your limited pre-programmed mind I thought of it something that is beyond you that you are downloading that you are channeling that is calling for you so allow yourself to script it and realize come to the realization that that truth that you have written down right is the truth and it can become your reality and the third thing I recommend everybody do during this time while the ports are still wide open is to take Massive Action take action towards that dream take action towards that goal commit step into that portal take that leap of faith have that trust and have that courage that what you can imagine what can come through you belongs to you is a part of you because the universe will not give you anything you cannot handle it's there for you so have trust have faith take that leap of faith step into that power and take action and when you take action make sure to follow through know that you are powerful know that you are strong know that that unknown and the changes that come along the way and the discomfort that may come with it is a part of your growth Journey it is here for you new moon for New Beginnings especially this powerful new moon is a Quantum shift is an opportunity for you to completely 10x 100x even a thousand X your life and your reality so make the most out of it other than that I just send my love and my prayers to every single one of you sending strength and courage to find the true you the new you the most powerful version of you and

Title: \\"The Future of Learning - YouTube\\" Transcript: \\"what do we think of when we think of the future as a country we have always embraced the future and discussed many big ideas about what the future may hold all of us have a common interest in the future kids what does the future hold for them our current system is failing our kids and our country we know that America is falling behind we are not getting kids where they need to be in reading science and math education is a critical part of the solution to every problem we face the key question is what does the future of learning look like and how will we create it when we think about the future we're usually doing one of two things dreaming or dreading when we dream we start with an idea a positive trend and take this idea to its logical conclusion we imagine a utopia that represents our hopes for all that's possible maybe that idea is a belief in the promise of technology to transform learning what would that look like we might dream of being able to assess each student's needs and then magically give them exactly what they need exactly when they need it but this is impossibly perfect and simplistic ignoring the complexities of the learning process when we dread we start with a fear a downward trend and we likewise play out this idea to its logical conclusion we imagine a dystopia one filled with our fears of what might happen in the future here the very same issue the use of technology in the classroom might veer off in a completely wrong direction with dreadful outcomes kids trapped in a matrix of robotic instruction of course this is equally simplistic and ignores technology's potential whether dreaming or dreading our role in the future we imagine is usually passive where the future is something that happens to us and to those around us but there's a third way we can think about the future between dreaming and dreading lies designing for designers the future is in a far off place it's a place where they work every day design is a four of activism we imagine the future we want then pick up the tools to start building it designers see the world as a kit of parts they reshape and reassemble the best pieces from what's already out there to create something new and better so what does it take to rethink learning it's not about replication it's about selecting and integrating many different parts to create the foundation of a new model this is the art of Integrative design from birth to adulthood society's purpose is critical to accelerate our learning and what's most important for kids today is learning how to learn society must develop learners ready to tackle challenges that cannot anticipate education is the system we created to serve that purpose over a hundred years ago we invented modern schooling to send kids to one of three main places the factory the farm or the university we always lost some kids but this model provided a middle class life for most and economic growth over time the economy changed farm jobs diminished and office jobs surged college grads always had better access but there was also a path straight from high school to the office as office work changed it got harder to get there from high school eventually that path disappeared College became the main path to opportunity we started sending more kids to college but we didn't change the overall system education broke down trapping too many kids on paths and no longer made sense for them or for the country as farm and factory jobs continued to decline we started to lose even more students the retail sector rose up to catch them but these low-skill low-wage jobs often fail to move kids forward in life with a decline of good jobs kids had nowhere to go retail increasingly offered the only alternative we lost even more students to dead-end futures more high school graduates tried to get into college but found they were not prepared for success academically or financially fortunately community colleges emerged to help people reengage in their own learning and seek new pathways forward they helped many students get back on track but most students still found their way to Community College on their own or by accident today far too many kids exit the K through 12 system feeling stuck our model of school is broken to understand how it's broken we need to look inside we see a system of six parts which create a student's experience first what they learn how they learn and how we know they're learning and also where and when learning happens and who's involved how we configure these parts determines how kids move through the learning process more often than not these parts form rigid barriers blocking the way forward or putting kids on the wrong path various innovators have focused on adjusting one or two of these parts to help kids move forward this has spurred important progress but this approach is not the answer what we need is learning integrated by design addressing all parts at once rather than one or two in isolation when we get this right we make it possible for kids to accelerate their learning to move forward in the direction they want to go the best design models require Kidpower students must apply themselves to the learning process it's our job to give them this chance and we believe that's more possible now than ever before our research shows that a few key attributes are central to the new models we need future of learning models must be personalized learner driven applied cost-effective and tech enabled and of course kids don't power this system on their own for every model a set of outside conditions can either block its progress or help it take off and really work for kids without the right conditions better models cannot take hold and scale but just imagine what the future of learning would look like if we align these new models with the conditions that help them succeed it would be a future where schools help kids get what they need to become successful learners and to accelerate their learning but while school remains critical it's not the only place where learning happens kids must be able to explore all their opportunities for learning both in school and beyond when we create a single integrated system students will practice becoming lifelong learners ready to go on to college or good jobs ready for the challenges and opportunities of the future that awaits them this is society's new purpose we're already mapping this new learning ecosystem we call our map the human capital continuum the paths that learners travel from birth to age 26 as they prepare for success in the adult world and we're far too many gets stuck at key transition points at two revolutions we design and

I’m NAME_1, and in this episode, I talk SaaS go-to-market with NAME_2 and our newest enterprise general partner NAME_3. The first half of the podcast looks at how remote work impacts the SaaS go-to-market and what the smartest founders are doing to survive the current crisis. The second half covers pricing approaches and strategy, including how to think about free versus paid trials and navigating the transition to larger accounts. But we start with why it’s easier to move upmarket than down… and the advantage that gives a SaaS startup against incumbents. NAME_4 : If you have a cohort of customers that are paying you 10,000 a year for your product, you’re going to find a customer that self-selects and is willing to pay 100,000 a year. Once you get one of those, your organization will figure out how you sell to, how you satisfy and support, customers at that price point and that size. But it’s really hard for a company that sells up market to move down market, because they’ve already baked in all that expensive, heavy lifting sales motion. And so as you go down market with a lower price point, usually, you can’t actually support it. NAME_1 : Does that mean that it’s easier for a company to do this go-to-market if they’re a new startup as opposed to if they’re a pre-existing SaaS? NAME_5 : It’s culturally very, very hard to give a product away for free that you’re already charging for. It feels like you’re eating away at you","output":"In this podcast episode, NAME_1, NAME_2, and NAME_3 discuss SaaS go-to-market strategies.

The discussion begins with the idea that it's easier for a SaaS startup to move upmarket than down. NAME_4 explains that once a company has customers willing to pay a higher price, the organization learns to cater to this market. However, it's challenging for a company that sells upmarket to move downmarket due to the high costs of their sales motion. NAME_1 and NAME_5 further discuss the difficulty for existing SaaS companies to shift their go-to-market strategies, especially when it involves offering a previously paid product for free."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following Transcript (Subtitles): Subtitles: 20 00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:45,131 Oh-ho, whoo!

Who is more likely to develop type 1 diabetes? What are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes? What causes type 1 diabetes? How do health care professionals diagnose type 1 diabetes? What medicines do I need to treat my type 1 diabetes? How else can I manage type 1 diabetes? Do I have other treatment options for my type 1 diabetes? What health problems can people with type 1 diabetes develop? Can I lower my chance of developing type 1 diabetes? What is type 1 diabetes? Diabetes occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes mainly from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the glucose in your blood get into your cells to be used for energy. Another hormone, glucagon, works with insulin to control blood glucose levels. In most people with type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. As a result, your pancreas stops making insulin. Without insulin, glucose can’t get into your cells and your blood glucose rises above normal. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive. Who is more likely to develop type 1 diabetes? Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. Having a parent or sibling with the disease may increase your chance of developing type 1 diabetes. In the United States, about 5 percent of people with diabetes have type 1.1 What are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes? Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are serious and usually happen quickly, over a few days to weeks. Symptoms can include increased thirst and urination increased hunger blurred vision fatigue unexplained weight loss Sometimes the first symptoms of type 1 diabetes are signs of a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) NIH external link. Some symptoms of DKA include breath that smells fruity dry or flushed skin nausea or vomiting stomach pain trouble breathing trouble paying attention or feeling confused DKA is serious and dangerous. If you or your child have symptoms of DKA, contact your health care professional right away, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. What causes type 1 diabetes?

Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby in three paragraphs: The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a novel set in the roaring twenties in New York City and Long Island. The story revolves around the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby, who throws extravagant parties in the hopes of winning back his lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby and Daisy had a romantic relationship before she married the wealthy and brutish Tom Buchanan, and Gatsby is determined to win her back. The novel explores themes of love, greed, and the corrupting influence of wealth, as well as the disillusionment of the American Dream. Through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to Long Island and becomes friends with Gatsby, the reader is introduced to the glamorous and superficial world of the wealthy elite. However, as the novel progresses, the façade of wealth and luxury is stripped away, revealing the emptiness and moral decay of those who are seemingly living the American Dream. The tragic ending ultimately highlights the futility of Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy and the corrupting influence of wealth and power. Through its exploration of the American Dream and the excesses of the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby remains a timeless classic that continues to captivate readers with its themes of love, greed, and the human condition. The novel's vivid characters and vivid prose make it a must-read for anyone interested in literature and the human experience."},{"instruction":"mmarize the great NAME_1 as if you were NAME_2","output":"NAME_1 is a highly accomplished individual who has made significant contributions in their field.

Founded in 1954 by Jack Tramiel in Toronto, Canada, it initially produced typewriters and adding machines before moving into electronic calculators in the 1960s. In the 1970s, as the calculator market became saturated, CBM transitioned into the burgeoning personal computer market. Their first product in this area was the Commodore PET, released in 1977, which was one of the first fully assembled personal computers available to consumers. However, CBM is perhaps best known for the Commodore 64, introduced in 1982. This 8-bit home computer became incredibly popular due to its advanced graphics and sound capabilities, coupled with its affordability. It is often credited as the highest-selling single computer model of all time. In the mid-1980s, CBM released the Amiga, a powerful multimedia computer that was ahead of its time. Despite its technical prowess, the Amiga struggled to compete with IBM and Apple's offerings, and CBM's fortunes began to decline. By the early 1990s, CBM was facing financial difficulties. Despite attempts to modernize their product line, they were unable to regain their former market position. In 1994, CBM filed for bankruptcy and its assets were sold off. While Commodore Business Machines is no longer in operation, its impact on the early days of personal computing is undeniable, and its products, particularly the Commodore 64 and Amiga, continue to have a cult following among vintage computing enthusiasts."},{"instruction":"Summarize the home page at www.milewealth.com","output":"MileWealth is a financial services company that offers a range of products and services, including investment management, financial planning, and wealth management.

The story begins in the final year of the war. The narrative starts with a dispute between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles over a captive woman named Briseis. Agamemnon takes Briseis from Achilles, which leads to Achilles withdrawing from the war in protest. This causes a significant setback for the Greeks. The gods, who have personal stakes in the war, interfere frequently, aiding their preferred sides and causing more conflict. The war intensifies when Hector, the noble Trojan prince, kills Patroclus, Achilles' best friend, thinking he was Achilles. This event brings Achilles back into the war with a thirst for revenge. He kills Hector in a one-on-one battle and dishonors his body by dragging it around the city walls of Troy. The gods intervene again, ensuring Hector's body is returned to his father, King Priam, for a proper burial. The Iliad ends with Hector's funeral, leaving the outcome of the war untold in this epic. However, it is widely known from other sources that the war ends with the fall of Troy, thanks to the infamous wooden horse strategy. The Iliad is not just a war story, but a tale of wrath, honor, death, and fate, exploring the heroism and horrors of war and the profound truths of the human condition."},{"instruction":"Summarize the importance of mindfulness and how it relates to stress reduction.","output":"Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present, aware of our thoughts, emotions, and surroundings, and accepting them without judgment or reaction.

In Chapter 3, titled \\"The History of Financial Markets,\\" NAME_2 discusses the evolution of financial markets and the key events that have shaped them. Here are the important points from this chapter: 1. Financial markets have evolved over time, from the early days of trading in coffeehouses in the 17th century to the sophisticated electronic exchanges of today. 2. The Dutch East India Company, established in 1602, was one of the first modern corporations. It issued shares that could be traded, paving the way for the development of financial markets. 3. The South Sea Bubble, which occurred in the early 18th century, was one of the first major financial market crashes. It was caused by excessive speculation in the South Sea Company's shares, leading to a sudden collapse in prices and widespread financial ruin. 4. The establishment of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1792 marked a significant milestone in the development of financial markets in the United States. 5. The gold standard, which was prevalent in the 19th and early 20th centuries, was a system where currencies were backed by a fixed amount of gold, providing stability to international finance. 6. The Great Depression, which began in 1929, was a severe economic downturn that exposed the flaws of the gold standard and led to significant financial reforms, such as the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1934. 7. The Bretton Woods system, established after World War II, was a new international financial framework that replaced the gold standard. It involved the US dollar being backed by gold and other currencies being pegged to the dollar. 8. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 led to the floating of currencies, which allowed them to fluctuate against each other based on market forces. 9. Deregulation and innovation in financial markets during the 1970s and 1980s"},{"instruction":"Summarize the intent of the text delimited by triple backticks into a single phrase start with a gerund.

Generate according to: Technologies design, production and marketing company Tesmec Group is constantly improving, adapting and evolving its machine concepts. Owing to its pursuit of a ‘glocal’ growth strategy, this means that Tesmec is global, but at the same time they have a local presence in strategic areas of the world. This is to enable the company to reach out, and identify and meet market needs in the best way possible, says Tesmec sales and marketing Africa specialist Ashley Gerstner. Tesmec believes that new technologies can fill the infrastructural gaps that exist between countries, as these will improve efficiency and meet the needs for future generations. Gerstner further mentions that research on industrial products pushes the company to be more innovative in its components, mechanisms and electronics to improve the performance of its products. Tesmec believes that attention to the machine or equipment does not stop at the product, but continues throughout its life cycle, through on-site inspections, regular reporting and continuous monitoring by company technicians. Gerstner points out that Tesmec machines are equipped with smart, innovative electronics and components such as its Re.M remote monitoring system. It provides on-demand retrieval of operating, maintenance and troubleshooting information to help improve each machine’s bottom-line performance. Gerstner further explains that Tesmec machines are also fitted with the new electronic TrenchTronic control system with touch screen and a completely new human-machine interface. This has been developed with the main purpose of improving ease of use of Tesmec machines, increasing productivity and making it less dependent on operator skills. Two of the company’s most notable successes in South Africa involve its trenching machines. Four of Tesmec’s 1 475 Trenchers were successfully used for State-owned Transnet’s new multi-product pipeline, to excavate pipeline trenches for the 500 km trunk line which ran from Durban to Gauteng. Tesmec’s trenching machines were also used for the Gamagara water project where a 1 675 Tesmec Trencher successfully excavated 50 km of pipeline trenches. Phase I of this project is an 85 km pipeline that stretches from Roscoe to Black Rock in Kathu, in the Northern Cape. On completion, beneficiaries of Phase I will include fourteen livestock farms, twelve mines, solar parks and the communities of Kathu, Olifantshoek and Hotazel. The maximum capacity of the current water scheme is 2 500 m3/h and the new scheme will be able to supply a peak demand of 5 200 m3/h, including future water supply to Botswana. The pipeline system is being upgraded by replacing the existing pipelines with a larger-diameter pipeline. The original scheme was built more than 50 years ago and has exceeded its life span. Gerstner adds that its machines were chosen as the best solution for these projects because its all-soil and very hard rock excavation expertise makes it possible to apply its trenching technology advantages to any terrain.","output":"Tesmec is a technologies design, production, and marketing company that is constantly innovating and improving its machine concepts to meet market needs.

The paper deals with the analysis and comparison of two approaches for training an AI system for image synthesis.","output":"Hello! I'm here to help you with any questions you have. The research paper you've provided is focused on comparing two approaches for training an AI system for image synthesis. The two approaches are: 1. Traditional Method: This approach involves training an AI system using a generative model, such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Variational Autoencoder (VAE), to learn the underlying distribution of images. 2. Progressive Growing Method: This approach involves training an AI system using a progressive growing network, where the network is progressively grown and fine-tuned through multiple iterations to improve its capability in generating high-quality images. The key findings of the research paper are: 1. Traditional Method: The traditional method is effective in generating high-quality images, but it has some limitations. For instance, it can be computationally expensive and may not be able to generate diverse enough images. 2. Progressive Growing Method: The progressive growing method is able to generate high-quality images with a more diverse range of styles and structures. This is because the progressive growing network is able to learn and adapt to the input data more effectively. In summary, the research suggests that the progressive growing method outperforms the traditional method in terms of generating high-quality and diverse images using an AI system. However, both methods have their own strengths and limitations, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and requirements.

The study demonstrated that Artificial Intelligence can accurately detect Covid-19 using deep learning methods.","output":"Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. It has been used successfully in a variety of fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In recent years, deep learning has also been applied to the field of healthcare, where it has been used to develop new methods for diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and developing new treatments. One area where deep learning has had a significant impact is in the field of medical imaging. Deep learning algorithms have been developed that can accurately detect and classify diseases from medical images, such as X-rays, MRI scans, and CT scans. In particular, deep learning has been used to develop algorithms that can accurately detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays. One study that demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning for detecting COVID-19 was conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The study, which was published in the journal Nature Medicine, used a deep learning algorithm to analyze chest X-rays from patients who were suspected of having COVID-19. The algorithm was able to accurately detect COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 97%. This means that the algorithm was able to correctly identify patients who had COVID-19 94% of the time, and it was able to correctly identify patients who did not have COVID-19 97% of the time. The results of this study suggest that deep learning algorithms can be used to accurately detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays. This could be a valuable tool for clinicians, as it could help them to identify patients who need to be tested for COVID-19 and to monitor patients who are suspected of having the disease. In addition to the study conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, there have been a number of other studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning for detecting COVID-19. For example, a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center used a deep learning algorithm to analyze chest X-rays from patients who were suspected of having COVID-19.

There were 1.5 million CIEDs implanted in 2011 and that number continues to grow. Between 1% and 4% of implantations result in infection, which have potential for severe morbidity and mortality outcomes. The mortality rate from CIED associated pocket infections can be as high as 66% if the device is not removed and up to 18% with device removal and antibiotic therapy. To address the need for additional methods to reduce or prevent these infections, 21MedTech is developing the ARRAY envelope for longer-term protection. The ARRAY envelope employs a novel bioresorbable polymer film that facilitates the controlled release of rifampin and minocycline locally following surgical implantation of a CIED. The envelope is highly tunable, enabling control over drug release and degradation time, and has been shown to be highly biocompatible in vivo. Prior to this Direct to Phase II proposal, 21MedTech has demonstrated safety and efficacy of the envelope material in vitro and in vivo and has demonstrated feasibility with controlled release of rifampin and minocycline over 28 days. 21MedTech has also shown improved drug release profiles over the commercially available TYRXTM envelope in vitro, which exhibits a burst release (>90%) in the first 24 hours. The goals of this proposal will be to optimize release of antibiotics from the envelope, assess safety and efficacy, and to determine the effective dose in a well-defined animal model. Success with these goals will advance the ARRAY envelope towards FDA clearance. Commercialization of the ARRAY envelope will improve CIED surgical outcomes and improve patient quality of life by reducing CIED associated infections.\\"\\"","output":"1. 21MedTech is developing the ARRAY™ antibiotic-loaded envelope, a novel method aimed at reducing the rising rates of infections associated with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).

The artist expresses the theme of drumming your own beat, living by your choices, and not conforming to societal norms. He begins by expressing his gratitude for life and the opportunities it has brought him, but also admits he's not the same person he used to be, now gaining more respect, freedom, and love. He lists a few of his accomplishments, reminiscing on times when he's been through lows and highs in life. He briefly touches on how he's learned from mistakes and regrets that he wouldn't change anything, even though he's made mistakes, as they are a part of his story and journey. Sinatra sings about the ways he's lived, reflecting on the things he's done but isn't afraid to die, knowing he'll be judged by his life. The chorus, \\"I did it my way\\" is a persistent message that echoes throughout the song, emphasizing his stance on being an individual and staying true to oneself. He highlights that he's a poor Albert, a man of wealth and taste, and loved, loved too much. He sings about historical figures such as Leadbelly and Floyd, who both sang the blues, but they didn't know the first thing about him, referring to the feeling of being misunderstood and different from others. The song concludes with Sinatra humbly asking for a comfortable chair and a pretty girl, saying he's being beat him to a pulp and is feeling swell. He thankfully says his talk isn't all about how he wants to be a good boy or bad boy, but it's all about satisfying some distant indifferent stars. He ends with letting the listeners know that there's no time starting over because \\"life's too short.\\" All in all, \\"My Way\\" by Frank Sinatra is a poignant message about the pursuit of life, individuality, and taking life's journey on your terms."},{"instruction":"Summarize the main characteristics of modernism and its impact on various art forms. Generate according to: Music has always been the sphere of gift and inspiration. Numerous composers and artists put their ideas into various music forms depending on their life experience and music they work with. Modernisms is referring to a series of radical movements in art, photography, architecture, literature, applied arts and music. Modernism emerged in the early 1890s. Beethoven’s contribution to world culture was determined by his unique symphonic works. He was the greatest symphonist, and his music fully embodied his worldview and basic artistic principles. Although Beethoven lived half his life in the 18th century, he is considered to be a composer of modern times. The classical works of art, whether these are paintings, sculptures or anything else, represent the high value nowadays. It is not only about the fact that they depict the scenes of that-time life or have an artistic merit. It is a message that an artist wanted to express through each particular painting of what mattered even more, as well as the methods used for this purpose. The book One River by Wade Davis is an example of brilliant non-fiction literature. It tells about the life of people in distant lands. It is an exploration of Amazon River and people who live there. This book discovers history, politic, science, botany, and culture of Indians. The novel by Mary Elizabeth Braddon Lady Audley’s Secret is a brilliant picture of life of Victorian England. There are some outstanding images of women in it. The author describes the life and destiny of Lady Audley, who is the main female character of this novel.","output":"Modernism is characterized by a series of radical movements in various art forms that emerged in the early 1890s. It profoundly impacted art forms such as music, photography, architecture, literature, and applied arts. Modernism sought to break away from the established conventions and artistic traditions, ushering in the era of experimentation and innovation. Key characteristics of modernism include the rejection of realism, emphasis on individualism, and a shift towards abstraction and symbolism. In music, modernism provided a fertile ground for composers to explore new harmonic languages, forms, and techniques. Prominent figures such as Beethoven, although rooted in the classical tradition, significantly influenced modernism by challenging established norms with their extraordinary symphonic works, thus embodying the spirit and artistic principles of the movement. Modernist music saw a growth in the use of atonality, polytonality, and experiments with rhythm and texture introduced by composers like Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and Claude Debussy. Modernism also influenced the realm of visual arts, as seen in the breakthrough works by painters and sculptors who sought to depict their subjects in non-traditional ways. They employed abstraction, symbolism, and unconventional techniques to convey messages that were often introspective and deeply personal. In this sense, modernist paintings and sculptures represented more than just aesthetic value, becoming vehicles for the artists' unique visions and communicating ideas beyond their time. In literature, modernism was marked by a transition towards experimentation in narrative styles, themes, and techniques. Writers produced groundbreaking works with innovative storytelling methods, stream-of-consciousness writing, and a focus on the psychological complexities of human existence. One River by Wade Davis, a non-fiction book exploring the Amazon River, serves as a prime example of how modernism influenced literature by delving into diverse subjects such as history, politics, science, and culture to paint a vivid account of the author's discoveries. Lady Audley's Secret by Mary Elizabeth Braddon is a novel that showcases modernism's influence on the depiction of women's roles and experiences in Victorian England. The book challenges societal norms and traditional gender roles through its complex portrayal of the titular character, Lady Audley. This novel sheds light on the broader themes of modernism by exploring the intricacies of individual identities and experiences against the backdrop of cultural and societal norms. In conclusion, modernism was a vital movement that revolutionized various art forms and catalyzed daring innovations in content, form, and technique. The impact of modernism can be seen across disciplines, from music and visual arts to literature, encouraging artists to break free from convention and redefine the boundaries of their respective crafts."},{"instruction":"Summarize the main events in World War II in 200 words.","output":"World War II, from 1939 to 1945, was the deadliest conflict in human history.

The study analyzes the impact on air and water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, resource conservation, and the overall reduction of waste in landfills. The paper asserts that proper implementation and management of recycling programs can significantly improve environmental quality by reducing pollution, conserving resources, and decreasing the amount of waste sent to landfills. For instance, recycling helps to minimize greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the need for energy extraction and processing, thereby decreasing the release of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere.  Moreover, recycling helps to conserve natural resources such as trees, minerals, and water. Although recycling itself can consume energy, the benefits in resource conservation often outweigh these costs. Recycling processes also encourage the reduction of waste sent to landfills, which reduces the amounts of methane and other harmful gases produced by decomposing organic waste.  However, the paper also identifies several challenges and limitations associated with recycling programs. These include high implementation costs, poor public participation, and the variability in quality of recycled materials. In addition, certain materials are difficult to recycle due to technological constraints, and the effectiveness of recycling programs can vary depending on factors such as economic policies and local infrastructure. In conclusion, while recycling programs can have a positive impact on the environment, their success largely depends on careful planning, efficient management, and high levels of public engagement. Effective recycling programs can help to mitigate pollution, conserve natural resources, and decrease reliance on landfills.

It's based on the belief that everything in the universe is interconnected and that the energy, or \\"chi,\\" in a space can influence well-being and success. Here are some of its key principles: 1. **The Five Elements**: Feng Shui uses five elements - Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water - to create balance and harmony. Each element is associated with certain colors and shapes and can be used to enhance specific areas of life. 2. **The Bagua**: This is a grid that Feng Shui practitioners use to analyze the energy of a space. Each of the eight sections corresponds to different life areas, such as wealth, health, and relationships. 3. **Yin and Yang**: These are opposing but complementary energies. Yin is soft, slow, and passive, while Yang is hard, fast, and active. A balance of these energies is considered ideal. 4. **Chi**: This is the life force energy that flows through everything. The goal of Feng Shui is to attract and enhance positive chi and to deflect or dissipate negative chi. In modern life, Feng Shui principles are often used in home and office design to create harmonious, balanced spaces. This could involve the placement of furniture, the choice of colors, the use of plants, and the incorporation of elements like water features or mirrors. For example, a desk might be positioned to face the door (a power position), clutter might be minimized to allow chi to flow freely, or specific colors might be used to enhance the energy of a particular life area.  Remember, Feng Shui is a complex practice with many layers and nuances, and this is just a basic overview.

The requirements for the project include hiring an intercept interviewer to assist with collecting responses from passersby through face-to-face interviews on an iPad/tablet. The survey is only a few minutes long, and the interviewer will be interviewing with one other interceptor in the shopping centre on the day. The target is to complete 25 interviews per person, with a total of 50 interviews for the shopping centre. The research will be conducted on Saturday 26th January, 9am onwards, and the interviewer must be available for up to 6 hours. The interviewer must have a positive attitude, be confident, outgoing, and a good communicator, and must be comfortable approaching people and getting them to complete a short survey on the spot. Previous experience in cold calling or door knocking is preferred, but it is not necessary. The interviewer must be able to provide their own iPad or tablet that has 4G or be able to hotspot to their own 4G device (i.e. smartphone) to complete the surveys with people.

Firstly, the centrally planned economy of the GDR was inefficient and lacked market mechanisms. This led to a misallocation of resources, with industries producing goods that were not in demand or of poor quality. As a result, the GDR struggled to compete with the more efficient and technologically advanced economies of the West. Secondly, the GDR heavily relied on outdated and polluting industries, such as coal mining and heavy manufacturing. These industries caused significant environmental damage, including air and water pollution, deforestation, and soil degradation. The lack of environmental regulations and enforcement further exacerbated the problem. Additionally, the GDR's economic policies prioritized heavy industry and military spending over investments in infrastructure, education, and consumer goods. This led to a neglect of important sectors, such as agriculture and consumer goods production, which further hindered economic growth and contributed to environmental degradation. Furthermore, the GDR's isolation from the global economy limited its access to modern technologies and international markets. This hindered innovation and made it difficult for the GDR to keep up with the rapidly changing global economic landscape. Lastly, the political and social system of the GDR, characterized by a lack of political freedoms and widespread surveillance, stifled creativity, entrepreneurship, and individual initiative. This further hindered economic development and contributed to the decline of the GDR economy. Overall, a combination of inefficient economic planning, reliance on polluting industries, neglect of important sectors, isolation from the global economy, and a repressive political system led to the decline of the GDR economy and major damage to the environment."},{"instruction":"Summarize the reported numbers in bulletpoint: Actually, the highest during the past 10 years with 22.3% on a cash basis and 46.3% on a GAAP basis, led by a large lease in our flagship Tech Square campus in Cambridge.

How do they affect students?","output":"Trigger warnings are statements that warn individuals about potentially distressing content in various media, including novels, movies, lectures, and academic material. They have been a topic of debate in recent years, particularly in the context of higher education and mental health. Research on trigger warnings is still relatively limited, but there have been a few key studies that highlight some potential effects on students. 1. A study published in Clinical Psychological Science in 2018 by Benjamin Bellet, Payton Jones, and Richard McNally investigated the effects of trigger warnings on participants' emotional responses to potentially distressing literary passages. The results suggested that trigger warnings may increase the likelihood of interpreting subsequent information as more emotionally charged, especially for those individuals who believe that words can cause harm. 2. Another study in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry in 2020 by Jones, Bellet, and McNally explored the potential implications of trigger warnings in reducing anxiety. In this study, participants were exposed to trigger warnings before reading negative texts and images. The results did not find any evidence supporting the short-term efficacy of trigger warnings in reducing anxiety symptoms. 3. A 2019 study by Mevagh Sanson and colleagues published in Cognition and Emotion examined the impact of trigger warnings on students' self-protection strategies. This study found that warnings may promote avoidance behavior, with students reporting they were less likely to choose material with a trigger warning compared to material that did not have one. In summary, current research on trigger warnings is limited, and their effects on mental health and emotions are not yet fully understood. Some studies suggest that trigger warnings may increase individuals' sensitivity to emotional content, while others indicate that they could promote avoidance behavior. There is no strong evidence so far to support claims that trigger warnings reduce symptoms of anxiety. More research is needed to draw definitive conclusions on the overall impact of trigger warnings on students."},{"instruction":"Summarize the responses of the candidate in this final interivew  NAME_1: But, welcome again.

There are many different techniques used for text summarization, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. **Extractive summarization** extracts the most important sentences from the text and presents them in a concise way. This can be done manually or automatically. Manual methods typically involve a human reader who selects the most important sentences. Automatic methods use natural language processing techniques to identify the important sentences. Extractive summarization is a relatively simple and efficient method, but it can sometimes miss important information that is not explicitly stated in the text. **Abstractive summarization** generates a new summary that is not simply a copy of the original text. This can be done manually or automatically. Manual methods typically involve a human writer who paraphrases the original text. Automatic methods use natural language processing techniques to generate a summary that is fluent and coherent. Abstractive summarization is more difficult than extractive summarization, but it can produce more readable and informative summaries. The choice of summarization technique depends on the specific application. For example, if the summary is to be used by a human reader, then an abstractive summary may be preferred. However, if the summary is to be used by a machine, then an extractive summary may be more suitable. In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in using deep learning techniques for text summarization. Deep learning models have been shown to be able to generate summaries that are more accurate and informative than summaries generated by traditional methods. However, deep learning models can be computationally expensive, and they require a large amount of training data. The future of text summarization is likely to see the continued development of deep learning techniques. Deep learning models will be able to generate more accurate and informative summaries, and they will be able to do so more efficiently. In addition, deep learning models will be able to be adapted to different summarization tasks, such as generating summaries for different types of texts or for different audiences."},{"instruction":"Summarize the text bellow in a subject line: We 're joined next by NAME_1 , CEO of Google Cloud , and NAME_2 , CEO and founder of Scale AI .

The summary states that if the global average temperature rises above 4°C (50%) by 2100, this would have severe and far-reaching impacts on the Earth's systems, including the climate, oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems. The text notes that, based on the best available scientific evidence, the warming of the planet's average temperature will be driven primarily by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. The summary states that if the warming is not limited to 1.5°C, it could lead to significant disruptions to the Earth's climate, such as sea-level rise, more frequent and intense heatwaves, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods, and the loss of biological diversity. The text notes that, while there are several strategies that could be used to limit the severity of future warming, including reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, adapting to the impacts of climate change, and investing in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture practices, significant challenges and investments will be required to implement and monitor these strategies.

The text notes that, while the impacts of climate change are already being felt around the world, the severity and scale of the impacts will continue to increase over time unless substantial and sustained action is taken to reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The summary states that the likelihood of achieving the 1.5°C goal will depend on the speed and scale of climate action and the ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change."},{"instruction":"Summarize the theory of evolution. No input","output":"The theory of evolution is a scientific explanation for how living organisms have changed over time through the process of natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow. Here is a brief summary of the key points: 1. Descent with modification: All living organisms share a common ancestor and have evolved over time through a process of modification. 2. Variation: Living organisms exhibit genetic variation, which is the raw material for evolution. 3. Heredity: The characteristics of an organism are determined by its genetic makeup, which is passed on from one generation to the next. 4. Adaptation: Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. 5. Natural selection: The process of natural selection acts on the variation in a population to favor individuals with traits that are better suited to their environment. 6. Speciation: Over time, populations can diverge and become reproductively isolated from one another, leading to the formation of new species. 7. Macroevolution: The gradual changes that occur over long periods of time, leading to the diversity of life on Earth. 8. Molecular evolution: The evolution of genetic material at the molecular level, which provides evidence for evolutionary relationships. 9. Phylogeny: The study of the evolutionary history of organisms, including their relationships and evolutionary paths. 10. Co-evolution: The idea that different species can evolve in response to each other, leading to reciprocal adaptations and co-evolutionary relationships. These are the main points of the theory of evolution, which has been extensively tested and supported through scientific evidence and observations."},{"instruction":"\\"---\\" Summarize the topics below in FAQ format, but summarize them in 1 question and answer. Please observe the options below. - Tone: Polite. - Style: In detail. - Reader level: College student - Length: Within 1500 characters - Perspective: Marketers - Format: Markdown Form - Answer me in English --- First of all, I think it would be good if you could tell us about the concept or characteristics of Ad-Mine. Yes, please answer first. We started with the integrated pad. Since the integrated pad itself is focused on the gate, people think filters are the most important thing. Now we're making a pick that we're looking forward to every day. Your brand needs care based on your skin type. So, let's use the conditioner. \\"Ad\\" is French, and it means \\"see you tomorrow.\\" Is it a hat every day? \\"See you tomorrow, see you tomorrow.\\" So if you think of it as a social feeling of anticipating not just today, but tomorrow, and anticipating new changes, I think it'd be nice if you could introduce the brand that you decided to launch before starting a business. I graduated from Seoul National University with a degree in venture management. I've been interested in starting a business since I was in college, but when I thought I couldn't do it anymore, I decided to try it. And I started with a brand business and I'm preparing a lot of things now.  Then how long have you been in this business? That start-up experience came out in October last year when I left the company. It's been about a year and a half. Then, may I ask what kind of work you usually do at your company? But the previous company was it company, and I went to it company called SK Plant, and now I came out of it after working on service planning and strategy planning. Thank you now. Actually, when the CEO is young, if there's something like age, these reporters really like to hear that the young CEO is doing well. So if you don't mind, I was born in 6 years. Thank you.    I think it'd be good if you could tell us about how AdMang's brand is growing. Adma launched its first launch in March last year, and since its first launch, it has planned to collaborate with various creators and released it. The first collaboration target was Arang, a creator, and starting with Arang, Jiyoon, Inseong, and Processing, it's a brand that's growing through collaboration with various influencers. We're going to communicate the benefits of the brand effectively to our customers. When I looked at the AdMang brand, the tono pad was done with Arang from the planning team. The model is not Arang, so the other creators who sold the products that you mentioned earlier are also pursuing this form of collaboration. And so, the goal of developing in the future is to collaborate with influencers who can collaborate. For example, toner pads are the representative products.  So, can you tell us what you liked more about doing it with Aran? You're a beauty expert in product development. Oh, so please tell me right away if there's anything you're lacking that you've been advised on or advantageous about. I think Arang is the best professional in cosmetics. Since we developed it with him, he pointed out clearly what kind of needs customers have and what factors they need to develop to satisfy these needs. So, we were worried when it first came out. It's because everything is based on the specifications of the shower, so the cost is a bit too high. The cost level that works well in the market is determined, right? I was a bit worried because there were products that went beyond those, but now that we played, I realized that this was the right direction. So now, I'm not going to look at the management numbers, but I'm going to make it with the direction that I'm going to make more decisions about customers and professional needs in that direction.","output":"**Q: Can you provide an overview of Ad-Mine, its growth, and its collaboration with influencers?** A: Ad-Mine is a brand that started with an integrated pad, focusing on providing care based on individual skin types.

The founder, a graduate of Seoul National University with a degree in venture management, started the business about a year and a half ago after leaving a previous IT company. Ad-Mine launched its first product in March last year and has since grown through collaborations with various creators such as Arang, Jiyoon, Inseong, and Processing. The goal is to effectively communicate the benefits of the brand to customers through these collaborations. For instance, the toner pads, one of the representative products, were developed with Arang, a beauty expert. Despite initial concerns about the high cost due to the product's specifications, the positive response from customers confirmed the right direction for the brand.

Just so we are on the same page about the proclamation let me share with you how the Church about how the message of Jesus about God is Good News for humanity. Here it is that: “Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God; a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world” (GDC 101). First of all I just want to know if you have ever heard a more potent and powerful expression of the Kingdom of God, “with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world.” As you know salvation is the central message of the good news. “This is the great gift of God which is to be considered as comprising not merely liberation from all those things by which man is oppressed, but especially liberation from sin and from the domination of the evil one, a liberation which incorporates that gladness enjoyed by every man who knows God and is known by him, who sees God and who surrenders himself trustingly to him.” This is a good beginning point for what might discuss what would be an “intimate and vital bond of man to God,” so that is a starting point of departure and the scope of our conversion because not all people believe even in this very brief and limited view of the Gospel message proclaiming salvation which is liberation, but also an intimate relationship with God. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Here are at least five reasons why the Gospel might be forgotten, overlooked or even explicitly rejected. I want to know in the comments below if one or more of these attunes might apply to you or may have been your perspective before you believed. Revolt against evil in the world Religious ignorance or indifference The cares and riches of this world The scandal of bad example on the part of believers Currents of thought hostile to religion  Finally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call. (CCC 29) Let me know if you are a believer and have ever once identified with one of these six reasons. If you do not believe does one of these six reasons apply to you and if so, which one. Pause, the video and go in the comments and let me know your thoughts. Take a moment to consider which one applies to you then we will discuss a passage from Scriptures and get your thoughts on that. First, of these six just pick one and let me know which one you think most applies to you now or at one time in your life may have been a reason for not believing in the proclamation without getting into any other reasons which one of these do you think relates to you the most. I would actually say after thinking more about it; before I believed I related most to number 2: religious indifference and a good dash of number 3 the cares and riches of the world with a great heaping helping of personal sin. I was not rejecting the Gospel because I was somehow revolting against in the world as reason not to believe, nor did care about scandals or hypocrites. Maybe a little on the prevailing negativity or lack thereof positive towards religion. If I had order these from most likely my attitude was from most to least was 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1. Mainly, I was just indifferent to it all and didn’t know much of anything, so I really did not care and because of my cares for the world and the things it namely my sinful desires I did not take it seriously. Then of course, I would hide from God out of fear and to flee his call, which I did during the middle part of my journey of faith as I was learning to commit my life to him. I would say now if there is anything that might hinder my faith it could be a revolt against the evil in the world. It sounds strange that what was least important to me before I believed would now be something that I could see making it difficult to believe. I might even say that the scandal and bad example on part of believers could also cause me to struggle in my faith. Oddly enough, I can definitely relate to all this attitudes although I don’t hold any of them now I can see how I could and might have these views and where you might stand in the conversation?

No heavy earth-moving equipment was available in the area, so villagers were digging through tons of dislodged mud with farm tools and their bare hands in a search for survivors, police Chief Lt. Col. Imron Yunus said.      The landslide occurred at a tea plantation near the mountainous village of Tenjoljaya in the Ciwidey district after days of heavy rain, he said.      Yunus said more than 60 people remained under the mud and debris, which covered at least 50 houses near the Perkebunan Teh Dewata tea plantation.      Yunus said five bodies had been pulled from the mud.      (This version CORRECTS village name to Tenjoljaya in graf 3) ||||| Heavy rain triggered floods in the area last week At least five people have been killed and dozens are missing after a huge landslide buried a village in West Java, Indonesia, officials say. Rescue teams have been sent to look for survivors at a tea plantation near Bandung, south of the capital, Jakarta. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the landslide, which is reported to have hit a workers' housing area in the morning. Landslides triggered by monsoon rain or floods are common in Indonesia. Bandung has had particularly heavy rains and floods, with scores of people fleeing from their homes to safety during the past two weeks. Communication problems More than 300 search and rescue personnel with heavy equipment are heading to the area, near Ciwidey village, about 35km (22 miles) south-west of Bandung city, officials say. \\"It had been raining very heavily since yesterday [Monday] and that probably caused the landslide,\\" Disaster Management Agency spokesman Priyadi Kardono told the AFP news agency. \\"We believe the landslide area could be the size of two football fields. The tea-processing plant and 50 houses were also buried.\\" Another official said some houses were buried so deep that even the rooftops were invisible. The plantation owns barracks to provide housing for its hundreds of workers. Mr Kardono said roads to the area had been blocked: \\"We're facing problems trying to reach them.\\" Rescue efforts are also being hampered by poor communication due to the collapse of a mobile phone tower which was brought down by the landslide. As no heavy earth-moving equipment was available in the area, villagers were digging through tonnes of mud with farm tools and their bare hands to search for survivors, police Chief Lt Col Imron Yunus told the Associated Press news agency. The Indonesian Red Cross said about 500 villagers who lost their homes had been moved to temporary shelters in neighbouring villages. Landslides - especially during the rainy season - are frequent in Indonesia, where years of deforestation can often leave hillsides vulnerable to collapse, says the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Jakarta. According to environmentalists, tropical downpours can quickly soak hills stripped of vegetation which had held the soil in place.

The article from Aeon discusses the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) and how close we are to creating truly intelligent machines. The author, neuroscientist and AI researcher David Eagleman, argues that while AI has made significant progress in recent years, it is still far from achieving true human-like intelligence. Eagleman explains that AI is primarily based on machine learning, which involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data. While these algorithms can perform tasks such as image recognition and language translation with impressive accuracy, they lack the deeper understanding and intuition that humans take for granted. The author also notes that the brain is a highly complex and mysterious organ, and that our understanding of how it works is still limited. Therefore, it is difficult to create AI that can truly mimic human intelligence. Eagleman suggests that we are more likely to achieve AI that is more like a \\"super-human\\" version of ourselves, rather than a truly intelligent machine. Despite these challenges, Eagleman acknowledges that AI has the potential to revolutionize many fields, including healthcare, transportation, and education. However, he emphasizes the need for caution and ethical consideration in the development and deployment of AI, to ensure that it is used responsibly and for the benefit of society as a whole. Overall, the article provides a balanced view of the current state of AI, highlighting both its potential and its limitations. It emphasizes the importance of continued research and development, as well as the need for ethical guidelines to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits humanity."},{"instruction":"mmarize this article: https://rb.gy/t2dpnh","output":"The article reports on a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco, which found that people who regularly consume artificial sweeteners may have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

The optic cups are precursors to the retina, and its development within the mini organoids resembled the emergence of eye structures in human embryos. The research could help scientists understand eye diseases, eye development, and differentiation processes, reports Michelle Starr for Science Alert. The study was published this week in the journal Cell Stem Cell. Organoids are small, three-dimensional tissue cultures that can replicate organs. Researchers grow tiny organoids from stem cells, or cells that have the potential to mature into any cell in the body, reports Yasemin Saplakoglu for Live Science. Growing organoids allows researchers to peer into how organs develop and provide valuable insights into how organs could react to specific drugs or treatments. There are two types of stem cells: adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a type of adult stem cell, which are derived from human embryos. Instead, iPSCs are taken from adult human cells, usually from a skin or blood sample, and converted into an embryonic-like state. Instead of remaining a skin or blood cell, these iPSC cells can now develop into any cell in the body. In previous studies, only pure retinal cells or optic cups were grown in the lab individually. Jay Gopalakrishnan, an organoid expert at University Hospital Düsseldorf, and his colleagues used iPSC-grown mini brains to see if eye structures could develop as an integrated part of the organoid—instead of growing the two parts separately, Science Alert reports.","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the article!

This is probably unsurprising because I am a machine learning engineer, it is my job to build the types of systems these artists are using. But what is less obvious is that my support is also because I am an artist, specifically a landscape photographer. Photography—just like AI-generated art—has a complicated history as “art”. Although the first photograph was taken in 1826, it wasn’t until 1924 that an American museum recognized the medium as art by including photographs in its permanent collection. At first artists feared photography would replace traditional visual arts due to the ease of taking a picture. But eventually they realized it was a useful tool that could be combined with other art forms, even if they did not recognize photography as an art in its own right. The concerns and criticisms currently being directed towards AI-generated art are the same as those leveled against photography in the past. And just as photography eventually gained ac","output":"- The open-source release of Stable Diffusion has led to significant advancements in AI-generated art. - Some artists have expressed concerns, claiming AI art is stealing their work, leading to protests on platforms like ArtStation. - Others argue that AI-generated art cannot be considered art because it isn't human-made. - The author, a machine learning engineer and landscape photographer, supports AI-generated art. - The author draws parallels between the acceptance of photography and AI-generated art as forms of art. - The first photograph was taken in 1826, but it wasn't until 1924 that an American museum recognized photography as art. - Initially, artists feared photography would replace traditional visual arts due to its ease, but they eventually saw it as a useful tool that could complement other art forms. - The author suggests that the criticisms against AI-generated art are similar to those faced by photography in its early days, implying that AI-generated art may also gain acceptance over time."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in under 300 words, adjusting the tone for Millenial readers. https://www.vogue.com/article/harry-styles-emrata-fashions-new-favorite-power-couple","output":"Alright, fam, here's the lowdown on the latest fashion power duo that's got everyone buzzing.

Japan's pacifist constitution currently allows only for self-defence, but Mr Abe has called for a re-interpretation. Any change is likely to seriously alarm Japan's East Asian neighbours. Mr Abe was set to visit the site of the 2013 Boston marathon bombing on Monday before travelling to Washington ahead of talks on Tuesday with President Barack Obama. The changes were announced in New York by Mr Kerry and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. \\"The guidelines that we have worked on that have been announced today will enhance Japan's security, deter threats and contribute to regional peace and stability\\", Mr Kerry said. \\"The United States and Japan stand together in calling for disputes in the region to be resolved peacefully.\\" Mr Kerry also renewed the US security pledge over the islets known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China. China has disputed Japan's territorial claim to the islands, which are close to important shipping lanes, offer rich fishing grounds and lie near potential oil and gas reserves The new guidelines are expected to reflect Japan's shift in its defence aspirations which were outlined in a cabinet resolution last July.

That’s the amount the average UK household wastes each year, by throwing away untouched or unopened food, according to the waste and sustainability charity Wrap. That’s a staggering 2m tonnes and the equivalent of roughly one in every three bags of groceries we bring into our homes. Food waste is not only bad for our pockets, it’s bad for the environment, too: 36m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions could be saved if we stopped throwing it into landfill. Storing ingredients properly to keep them fresher for longer, planning mealtimes and getting creative with leftovers are three simple ways with which we can reduce our food-waste footprint. Let’s start with the UK’s five most-wasted ingredients. Bread We chuck out about 20m slices of bread every day. I always store half my fresh loaves in the freezer, sliced and wrapped tightly. Revive a stale loaf by sprinkling with a little water, placing on a lined baking sheet and into a low oven for a few minutes (or in the microwave in 30-second blasts). Alternatively, turn it into breadcrumbs (or do like the Italians and make pangrattato), use to thicken soups, such as pappa al pomodoro (Tuscan bread and tomato soup), ribollita and gazpacho, or use instead of pine nuts in a pesto; they’re the secret to thicker sauces, too.

NAME_1 was terminated in January 2018 after presenting a scathing quality control report on the vessel to OceanGate’s senior management, including founder and CEO NAME_2, who is on board the missing vessel. According to a court filing by NAME_3, the preamble to his report read: “Now is the time to properly address items that may pose a safety risk to personnel. Verbal communication of the key items I have addressed in my attached document have been dismissed on several occasions, so I feel now I must make this report so there is an official record in place.” The report detailed “numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns,” according to the filing. These included NAME_3’s worry that “visible flaws” in the carbon fiber supplied to OceanGate raised the risk of small flaws expanding into larger tears during “pressure cycling.” These are the huge pressure changes that the submersible would experience as it made its way and from the deep ocean floor. He noted that a previously tested scale model of the hull had “prevalent flaws.” Carbon fiber composites can be stronger and lighter than steel, making a submersible naturally buoyant. But they can also be prone to sudden failure under stress. The hull that NAME_3 was writing about was made by Spencer Composites, the only company to have previously made a carbon fiber hull for a manned submersible. (That submersible was commissioned by explorer NAME_4 for a record-breaking dive, but he died in a light aircraft crash before it could be used.) NAME_3’s recommendation was that non-destructive testing of the Titan’s hull was necessary to ensure a “solid and safe product.” The filing states that NAME_3 was told that such testing was impossible, and that OceanGate would instead rely on its much touted acoustic monitoring system. The company claims this technology, developed in-house, uses acoustic sensors to listen for the tell-tale sounds of carbon fibers in the hull deteriorating to provide “early warning detection for the pilot with enough time to arrest the descent and safely return to surface.”  NAME_3, however, worried in the lawsuit that the","output":"The director of marine operations at OceanGate, a company that specializes in manned submersibles, was fired in January 2018 after raising concerns about the safety of the company's first-of-a-kind carbon fiber hull.

Crystal The game takes place in a lab, in which two scientists in charge of robot ants are competing to find the most efficient way of gathering crystals. However, the ants cannot be controlled directly. The ants will respond to the presence of beacons.  \\tRules The game is played in turns. On each turn, both players perform any number of actions simultaneously. The Map On each run, the map is generated randomly and is made up of hexagonal cells. Each cell has an index and up to six neighbors. Each direction is labelled 0 to 5. Hex directions Each cell has a type, which indicates what the cell contains: 0 if it does not contain a resource. 1 if it contains the egg resource. 2 if it contains the crystal resource. The amount of resources contained in each cell is also given, and is subject to change during the game as the ants harvest cells. A cell may also have a base on it. The players’ ants will start the game on these bases. Blue base Egg Ants & Beacons Both players start with several ants placed on their bases. The players cannot move the ants directly but can place beacons to affect their movement. Players can place any number of beacons per turn but can only place one each per cell. When placing a beacon, players must give that beacon a strength. These beacon strengths act as weights, determining the proportion of ants that will be dispatched to each one. In other words, the higher the beacon strength, the greater the percentage of your ants that will be sent to that beacon. Example In the following example, there are three beacons of strength 2,1, and 2.  White numbers in a colored diamond represent the ants. Here, 10 ants in total will be dispatched to the beacons. The 10 ants will move to the three beacons, keeping the same proportions as the beacon strengths. The ants will do their best to take the shortest paths to their designated beacons, moving at a speed of one cell per turn. In between turns, the existing beacons are powered down and removed from play. Use beacons to place your ants in such a way to create harvesting chains between your bases and a resource. Harvesting Chains In order to harvest crystal and score points, there must be an uninterrupted chain of cells containing your ants between the resource and your bases. The amount of crystal harvested per turn is equal to the weakest link in the chain.

The French government and ruling classes viewed the protests as an act of \\"insurrection,\\" and there were instances of violence and vandalism, including the burning of town halls and the ransacking of administrative buildings. The police used tear gas, water cannons, pepper spray, bullets, and grenades to suppress the protests, and around 457 arrests were made.

So when we’re talking about something built around words, we can give a system a tremendous amount of words written on the internet to learn from. That’s harder when you’re talking about driving, harder when you’re talking about caring for the elderly, harder when you’re talking about unusual diseases, harder when you’re talking about all kinds of things in the real world where we don’t have gigantic data representations of them and we can’t run simulations the way we can of, say, a computer game a million times. So how do you solve that problem if these systems are going to make the jump into the world we live in, where not all the data is digitally presentable or rerunnable so you can simulate? What happens there? GARY MARCUS: I think this goes back to why we so badly need a paradigm shift. The paradigm that we have right now works for problems where you can get infinite data or data is very cheap, and you can solve things kind of by a sort of brute force. You can predict the next word that somebody is going to say pretty well by just having an internet’s worth of data, which is a lot of data, and you can get that data. But there are other things, like how people think about each other, that are maybe never expressed and that you maybe just can’t find the data for. And then you have these so-called outlier cases. So the problem with driverless cars is that things come up and there just isn’t any data there to represent these weird scenarios, like what happens if you summon your car across a jetway. And so humans are not so driven by massive amounts of data. We always need some data but we’re trying to have abstractions. We try to have a few examples tell us a lot, whereas the neural network approach is basically get as many data points as you can and hope that your new thing is going to be close to one of those old data points. I think that that’s just the limited paradigm, and that’s what we’re discovering. It’s not really working for truth and reasoning. [MUSIC PLAYING] EZRA KLEIN: What is the time frame, if you were to guess, on which you think we will begin to have things that have a general intelligence to them, because I get the sense you don’t believe it’s impossible. GARY MARCUS: I don’t think it’s impossible at all. Humans could do it. Humans are basically machines. We’re biological machines. The heart is there to pump the blood, and the brain is there to process information. And we are able to be fairly general. The notion of a general intelligence is actually a little bit vague. So when we talk about it for a human, we mean any reasonable problem I can get you to solve. But it doesn’t mean, for example, that everybody is going to be able to solve some complicated problem in differential calculus or whatever. So there’s some variability. But importantly, I can tell anybody who’s, let’s say, had at least some education to do like a zillion different things, and they can learn pretty quickly to do that thing at least reasonably well, whereas machines are mostly trained on one particular task, and they do it well. GPT is interesting because it’s trained on one particular task, which is predict the next word on a sentence, and it can do a bunch of things. But you still wouldn’t trust it the way you would trust an undergraduate intern to, let’s say, make phone calls to a bunch of people and check that everything is OK and so forth. Like here’s a new task. You’ve never done it before. Go do it. We don’t really know how to do that yet. Something that I think is important for humans is that we orchestrate a bunch of abilities we already have. So if you look at brain scans, that old saying about you only use 10 percent of your brain is wrong. But there’s a little substance to it, which is at any given moment you’re only using certain pieces of the brain. And when you put someone in brain scan, you give them a new task, try this thing, they’ll use a different set of underlying brain components for that task. And then you give them another task, they pick a different set. So it’s almost like there’s orchestration. Like you guys come in, you guys come in. We’re very, very good at that. And I think part of the step forward towards general intelligence will be instead of trying to use one big system to do everything, we’ll have systems with different parts to them that are, let’s say, experts at different components of tasks. And we’ll get good at learning how to plan to use this piece and then this piece and that piece. I see all of this happening over the next decade, two decades, three decades, four decades. On my darker days I say, you know, the stuff that we’re doing right now just doesn’t have anything to do with the answer. On my brighter days I say, but there’s so many people working on the problems that eventually we’re going to sort this out. And it’s very hard to know. I mentioned Yann LeCun a couple of times, and we disagree about a lot of things. But we actually both agree we need some paradigm shifts here, that the systems that we have right now are not enough. But then question is, what are those paradigm shifts? You could think in the age of alchemy, people didn’t really know what they were looking for. They knew they could get some stuff to happen, but they didn’t have a theory of chemistry yet. And they didn’t even know how to frame the question at that point. And I think we’re a little bit like that. We need some new ways of thinking about things, and it’s hard to predict when those will happen. Will they happen this year? Did they already happen but nobody knows about them? Or is it going to take another 10 years of brushing away the cobwebs in front of our eyes to say, we weren’t thinking about this correctly at all. There’s this other thing that we need to do. And so it’s really hard to put any kind of specific number around it. As a scientist, I always want to put confidence intervals around things anyway. I want to say, 10 plus or minus 5, or 40 plus or minus 10 or something like that. But in this case, there’s so much unknowable about what the answer is going to look like relative to what we know now that it’s hard to say. You mentioned my book a couple of times, “Rebooting A.I.” I think there we gave — and Ernie Davis, my co-author — I think we gave a good diagnosis of where the field is falling short. But we didn’t even pretend that we knew the answer. We have a sentence in there about how we think we need to do these seven things, and it’s a tall order. We give a sketch of what might need to be done, but each of those seven things is hard. So one example is we talk about causal reasoning. How is it that when we see some things, and then some other things, we decide which of these things actually caused those and which are just correlated? We talk a lot about temporal reasoning. So it’s easy to trip GPT up with things like you say, this cow died. When will it be alive again? And instead of saying, well, that’s ridiculous. It’ll never be alive again. Just go and try to calculate how long it takes for new cow to be born. So the systems that we have now are not that great at temporal reasoning. So we need to do work on temporal reasoning. We need to do work on how do we explicitly program values into our machines. If we don’t do that, we’re in real trouble. summarize this","output":"Gary Marcus, a scientist, and author, discussed the limitations of current artificial intelligence (AI) systems and the need for a paradigm shift in the field. He believes that the current approach, which relies on massive amounts of data and brute force, is not sufficient for solving complex problems in the real world, where data may be limited or unavailable. He suggests that humans have a different approach to problem-solving, which involves abstractions and orchestrating different abilities, and that AI systems need to move towards this approach. He also mentions that we need to program values into our machines, or we could be in trouble.

Similar to LLaMA, we trained a ~15B parameter model for 1 trillion tokens. We fine-tuned StarCoderBase model for 35B Python tokens, resulting in a new model that we call StarCoder. We found that StarCoderBase outperforms existing open Code LLMs on popular programming benchmarks and matches or surpasses closed models such as code-cushman-001 from OpenAI (the original Codex model that powered early versions of GitHub Copilot). With a context length of over 8,000 tokens, the StarCoder models can process more input than any other open LLM, enabling a wide range of interesting applications. For example, by prompting the StarCoder models with a series of dialogues, we enabled them to act as a technical assistant. In addition, the models can be used to autocomplete code, make modifications to code via instructions, and explain a code snippet in natural language. We take several important steps towards a safe open model release, including an improved PII redaction pipeline, a novel attribution tracing tool, and make StarCoder publicly available under an improved version of the OpenRAIL license. The updated license simplifies the process for companies to integrate the model into their products. We believe that with its strong performance, the StarCoder models will serve as a solid foundation for the community to use and adapt it to their use-cases and products. Evaluation We thoroughly evaluated StarCoder and several similar models and a variety of benchmarks. A popular Python benchmark is HumanEval which tests if the model can complete functions based on their signature and docstring. We found that both StarCoder and StarCoderBase outperform the largest models, including PaLM, LaMDA, and LLaMA, despite being significantly smaller. They also outperform CodeGen-16B-Mono and OpenAI’s code-cushman-001 (12B) model.

Now NAME_1, DeepMind’s cofounder and CEO, says his engineers are using techniques from AlphaGo to make an AI system dubbed NAME_2 that will be more capable than that behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Content To honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it originates from. DeepMind’s NAME_2, which is still in development, is a large language model that works with text and is similar in nature to GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT. But NAME_3 says his team will combine that technology with techniques used in AlphaGo, aiming to give the system new capabilities such as planning or the ability to solve problems. “At a high level you can think of NAME_2 as combining some of the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with the amazing language capabilities of the large models,” NAME_3 says. “We also have some new innovations that are going to be pretty interesting.” NAME_2 was first teased at Google's developer conference last month, when the company announced a raft of new AI projects. AlphaGo was based on a technique DeepMind has pioneered called reinforcement learning, in which software learns to take on tough problems that require choosing what actions to take like in Go or video games by making repeated attempts and receiving feedback on its performance. It also used a method called tree search to explore and remember possible moves on the board. The next big leap for language models may involve them performing more tasks on the internet and on computers. NAME_2 is still in development, a process that will take a number of months, NAME_3 says. It could cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. NAME_4, OpenAI CEO, said in April that creating GPT-4 cost more than 100 million. Playing Catch-Up When NAME_2 is complete it could play a major role in Google’s response to the competitive threat posed by ChatGPT and other generative AI technology. The search company pioneered many techniques that enabled the recent torrent of new AI ideas but chose to develop and deploy products based on them cautiously. Since ChatGPT’s debut Google has rushed out its own chatbot, NAME_5, and put generative AI into its search engine and many other products.

So as promised, here is an update. So I had a good discussion with, with Aaron and here's kind of our general thoughts about this situation. 0:15 So in general, you know, this is obviously not an optimal situation. Usually we would expect to be better kind of informed from the start and, you know, be involved in what's going on to, to kind of a little bit better understand the situation and so on. 0:36 But I also understand that this is a little bit of a stressful situation for you too. So I think we are going to kind of like give you the benefit of the doubt here and like as I mentioned on Friday, we're open to collaborating and I think the most logical thing to do would be to kind of repurpose the material we already have so that you can make use of it. 1:04 You don't have to create something from scratch. And this could maybe be a start of more of a long term collaboration with kind of you repurposing some of our material within the Indian market. 1:19 However, the main thing for us in order to make a decision is we need to really understand then what, what that would entail in terms of you providing us with a proposal of everything from, I think it would be useful to know what is the timeline, you know, what would you need, by what point what would we have to do, like what would be expected from us to do and by what point what would be the general reason for us to do it in terms of what, like how would the kind of revenue split or licensing look like? 2:04 And yeah, in general, how do we want to go about potentially then running this for, for, for the, you know, client that you have? 2:20 Like how, how do you, how and when would you foresee running this for the client that you have? Because I think it's really tricky timing because we're used before Christmas and so it's, it's, it's not optimal in that sense, but for us to really make a decision whether, you know, we can do this and if we're willing to, to find a way to work this out we really have to understand, you know, what, what needs to be done when does it need to be done and how should we, should we do it? 2:57 And I think right now We honestly don't really have a clear proposal about that. So I think that's what really we would need a very clear proposal and, and then we can make a real decision whether it's, it's something we can commit to doing. 3:12 Because right now, again, the problem is we, we were never informed initially about this project in full. And now it feels like we're kind of like figuring out, okay, how can we do this together? 3:24 And in general terms, or for the most part, you know, we really care about doing not the quick thing but the right thing, right? 3:34 We wanna do things in the best way possible. So this very stressed throw something together approach is not really what we would like to do. 3:44 And so we usually like to work more long term thinking more in steps, plan and so on. But again, the situation is what it is. 3:53 So if you can at least provide us with a clear understanding of, again, you know how this can look like, what the timeline is and what you propose as some form of like revenue or licensing split or structure, then we can make a final decision whether we can do it or not. 4:13 Because right now it's a little bit unclear of what, what this would entail. But it seems like a, yeah if we can make it work, I think it would be a nice opportunity to collaborate and maybe having this as a first step towards more long-term collaborations as well. 4:33 So, so yeah let me know if I have any questions, but, but that basically that's, that's what we would need a clear proposal of of how we could do this and, and what you suggest. 4:45 So yeah, if you have a chance to provide that as soon as possible, but when you get a chance and then we can look at it and make a decision. 4:53 But that's where we're right now and I hope you understand the situation. So, so yeah, hope this finds well and talk to you soon. 5:02 Bye.\\"","output":"Subject: Request for a Clear Proposal on Collaboration Hi Rahul, Hope all is well!

Before Support Center, customers had to email support before they could get any help 😬, it was clunky and prone to *\\"*email got sent to spam errors\\", and *\\"*I didn't check my email problems\\", realizing that the experience wouldn't do, the dev team drafted up the idea to connect the current Salesforce based ticketing system with a UI/UX customers would enjoy. The main hick-up we ran into during development was caching (the bane of all Software Engineers everywhere) and the excessively complex (and archaic) work of integrating with Salesforce. 📚 Fun fact: Salesforces uses a SQL-like syntax for querying data that's similar to SQL but yet very far away from SQL, it's called SOQL, and working with it can be very frustrating The problems boiled down to:  How do you keep the cache always up to date?  How to keep the support center fast, responsive, and reliable with the most up-to-date info?  How to make working with Salesforce easier? The solution to all these problems... 🥁 webhooks of course.  In essence, whenever a change is made on Salesforce we call a webhook and have that webhook sync with a cache that we use for the support cases 🤯. We can then expand how long the cache should securely hold case data, and add a cache warm-up for when on the main page. Both of these deal with the caching issues, and for the last problem we just powered through and I think the results are pretty fantastic.

The day was proceeding like any other Tuesday when NAME_4's research assistant, appeared at her office door with a concerned look on his face. The latest participant in the double-blind trial, a man named NAME_1, had filled out a standard questionnaire at the end. Strangely, at the very bottom of the form, NAME_1 had written in bold letters: \\"This experience has helped me sort out a debilitating personal issue. Google my name.

Two months earlier, activists at Chicago Antifascist Action had exposed NAME_1's identity, and he had lost his job. NAME_6 was now very worried.

Our approach is built upon hierarchical models, combining a low-level imitation policy and a high-level motion planning policy to steer the character in a motion embedding learned from broadcast videos. When deployed at scale on large video collections that encompass a vast set of examples of real-world tennis play, our approach can learn complex tennis shotmaking skills and realistically chain together multiple shots into extended rallies, using only simple rewards and without explicit annotations of stroke types. To address the low quality of motions extracted from broadcast videos, we correct estimated motion with physics-based imitation, and use a hybrid control policy that overrides erroneous aspects of the learned motion embedding with corrections predicted by the high-level policy. We demonstrate that our system produces controllers for physically-simulated tennis players that can hit the incoming ball to target positions accurately using a diverse array of strokes (serves, forehands, and backhands), spins (topspins","output":"This paper presents a system that learns diverse, physically simulated tennis skills from large-scale demonstrations of tennis play harvested from broadcast videos.

After the death of his father, Casper is plagued by feelings of self-blame and post- traumatic stress. These feelings slowly but surely push him into a corner and force him to face himself. LONG SYNOPSIS While Casper (25) is out hunting with his father Joseph, his father dies. We as an audience are not told exactly what happened, but it’s clear that Casper feels a lot of guilt and believes he could have prevented his father's death. Casper decides to move back in with his mother Chris for a while so they can process this death together and make the necessary preparations for the funeral. Even though Casper tries to reconnect with his mother, the close bond they once had feels completely lost now that Joseph is gone. Everywhere Casper goes he feels like he is being followed, more and more often he begins to see a strange figure in the distance. It resembles Casper himself, but its head is completely wrapped in wool. This strange entity does nothing, it just stands there, looking at him in silence. Casper can't keep his focus on anything and is constantly distracted by this presence. The more Casper sees the entity, the closer he seems to get. At the reception after the funeral Casper is slowly being pushed into a corner. Behind his back, people seem to have their own opinions about the death of his father and they don’t seem to really care for him. Casper isolates himself from the rest and we learn that his father committed suicide in front of him. He slowly gets trapped in his own head and eventually has no choice but to confront the entity. He gathers all his courage and walks towards it, for the first time. He attacks the entity and begins to remove the covers from its face. He keeps looking, but there appears to be no one under the cloths. Perhaps he is not as guilty after all as he blames himself?","output":"Guilt"},{"instruction":"mmarize this [MUSIC PLAYING] EZRA KLEIN: So this gets back to the more optimistic view, which is that as these models get larger, their ability to create not just truthful content but innovative content, advances in knowledge even, would increase. But you write in that paper you mentioned a few minutes ago, “Deep Learning is Hitting a Wall,” quote, “A 2022 paper from Google concludes that making GPT-3-like models bigger makes them more fluent but no more trustworthy.” Tell me about that paper. How did that work, and why should I trust that result? GARY MARCUS: So I mean, what people have been doing is just throwing a lot of benchmarks of different sorts that are indices of different things and saying, if we have a model that’s this big, if we have a model that’s 10 times bigger, if we have a model that’s 100 times bigger, how much better do we do on all of the things that we’re testing? And some things are much better. So if you want to have a model give you a synonym of something, the more data that you train it on, the more likely it’s going to give you an interesting synonym or give you more synonyms. And so there are many ways in which these models have steadily improved. On truthfulness, they really haven’t improved as much. I don’t think we have great benchmarks around truthfulness. I think it’s only in the last six months that people have really broadly recognized in the industry how serious a problem that is. And so there’s one benchmark called Truthful Q.A. We probably need 10 or 20 looking at different facets of the problem. But the result reported in that particular paper by Google was there wasn’t as much progress on understanding truthfulness. There are other problems, too. I mean, we’ve been focusing mainly around misinformation. But there’s a broader question about comprehension, and do these models really understand the world that they’re in? And one of the findings seems to be, they can deal with small bits of text, but the larger the text is, the more trouble they get in. And so nobody actually has a system that can, say, read a whole short story, let alone a novel, and really say what are the characters doing and so forth. And that Google paper also reported — or maybe, I guess, it was a subsequent paper called “Big Bench,” reported that making models bigger is not necessarily helping in the comprehension of larger pieces of text.","output":"The conversation is about the limitations of deep learning models in generating truthful and comprehensive content, despite their ability to generate fluent and large amounts of text.

In classical computers, information is stored and processed using bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1. However, in quantum computers, information is stored and processed using quantum bits, or qubits. What makes qubits special is that they can exist in multiple states at the same time. While a classical bit can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This is known as superposition. It's like having a coin that can be heads and tails at the same time. Another important property of qubits is entanglement. When qubits are entangled, the state of one qubit becomes connected to the state of another qubit, no matter how far apart they are. This means that changing the state of one qubit will instantly affect the state of the other qubit, even if they are separated by vast distances. These unique properties of qubits enable quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. Quantum computers can solve complex problems that would take classical computers a very long time or be practically impossible. They have the potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, drug discovery, and material science. However, quantum computing is still in its early stages, and building practical, error-free quantum computers is a significant challenge.

This shows the fragility of the system. News agencies can try to explain the reasons as being poor risk management and losses on securities, they can blame the Federal Reserve, even here in Canada, regulators seized the assets of the Toronto branch. Is this something new?  Not at all.  We can talk about the virtual economy that is created by Ribā and the stock market.  Numbers are overinflated and the wishful thinking of investors are culprits as well.  All it takes is a slight loss in confidence.  Depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money, and stockholders also rush to sell their valueless stocks. We should not get entrapped in the symptoms, brothers and sisters.  What we are seeing today, what we saw in the 2008 financial crisis and others before it, are symptoms of the inherent problem. The trouble started when money no longer carried any intrinsic value.  Never in the history of man have we been in a situation in which money is literally created out of thin air by a cartel of private bankers.  The Federal Reserve in the United States is not federal and it certainly has no reserves. Before President Nixon's decision on August 15, 1971 to completely eliminate gold from the money equation, there was the gold exchange standard where money was tied to gold. Before the gold exchange standard was the gold standard, and this was before the United States government, under President Franklin D Roosevelt, seized all gold from its citizens on March 9, 1933. Conventional banking, which has its own history and development, is fueled by the modern fiat monetary system. Banks don't have money stored away.  Money is created when banks give out loans.  Money is created from debt! So such collapses are not a surprise nor should they be. Gold never gets old.  If you have savings, invest them in gold coins outside of the grid.  I mean go out and buy gold coins and store them away yourself. The United States is bankrupt, and things will only get worse as time passes. It is a blessing that I am in the process of writing my book on Ribā and Islamic banking.  People in general, and Muslims in particular, have to have some foundational knowledge of how we came to the situation we are in today as far as the monetary system. We have to know what is Sharī‘ah compliant and adhere to it. Those convenient Fatāwā about it being permissible to buy a house on a conventional mortgage in the West are not only fragile as far as their justifications and proofs, but as time continues, practical events will prove that there is nothing good about Ribā. A house bought with Ribā is a cursed house.","output":"The 16th largest bank in the U.S., Silicon Valley Bank, collapsed due to a bank run, highlighting the fragility of the banking system.

In this period, and within the specific circumstances of Greek culture, reason (logos, ratio) is discovered as a new explanatory principle.  In the centuries preceding this spectacular innovation, Greek culture, like many ancient cultures, is based on age-old traditions established through stories. These stories, myths, provide an answer to all sorts of questions: questions of origin, of meaning, of the legitimacy of power, anxious questions about fearful events, or questions, filled with wonder, about the why of things.  As a rule, a myth refers to a single, foundational event that took place somewhere in the dim and distant past or outside time. The present is subsequently derived from this event. In this tradition, the causes of events are not impersonal forces, but mostly gods or demigods, who determine the course of events through their actions. Mythical people live in a universe where everything is brought about by mysterious, divine acts of will, which do not even have to be rational or moral. The fortunes of the world are the effect of sexual relationships between gods, of their internal struggle for power, of their whims, or of other contingent motives.  The Greek mythical world view was established by poets such as Homer (8th century BC) and Hesiod (7th century BC). In his Theogony, Hesiod describes the origin of the gods, and establishes their mutual relations. Regarding the very beginning of the cosmos, he writes: In truth at first Chaos came to be, but next wide-bosomed Gaia (earth), the ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympos, and dim Tartaros in the depth of the wide-pathed earth, and Eros, fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the 19 mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them. From Chaos came forth Erebos and black Night; but of Night were born Aether and Day, whom she conceived and bore from union in love with Erebos. And Gaia first bore starry Ouranos (heaven), equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long hills, graceful haunts of the goddess Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bore also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontos, without sweet union of love. But afterwards she lay with Ouranos and bore deepswirling Okeanos, Koios and Krios, and Hyperion and Iapetos, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne ... (Hesiod, Theogony v. 116-135) (Trans. H. G. Evelyn-White, with mod.) This text serves as a perfect illustration of the explanatory method used in myths. The order of reality is derived from the genealogy of the gods. Natural forces and celestial bodies are described as anthropomorphic gods, and the world order is the effect of their contingent decisions and relations.  Obviously, it cannot be denied that myths have an explanatory value: the point of myths is precisely to explain how what exists has come about. In that sense, myths tell a truth. But their method of explanation is distinctive in a number of ways. First, it is kind of knowing that is not critical. Myths do not question their own explanatory method. In general, myths are also normative: they not only explain why things are what they are, but also show why things have to be that way. Hence, the present is affirmed and, what is more, legitimized. In the telling of myths, which is often accompanied by other ritual practices, the cause is re-presented, time and again. It is a contact with the divine, where the practice of telling plays a crucial role. \\"","output":"Western philosophy originated in the 6th century BC in ancient Greece, where reason, often referred to as \\"logos\\" or \\"ratio,\\" was introduced as a new explanatory principle. Before this, Greek culture, similar to other ancient civilizations, relied on traditional stories, or myths, to provide answers to various questions about life's meaning, origin, and the legitimacy of power. Myths generally involve a foundational event from the distant past or outside of time, with the present being derived from these events. The causes of these events were often gods, demigods, or other supernatural entities. Poets like Homer and Hesiod helped establish the Greek mythical worldview, as seen through Hesiod's Theogony, which uses genealogy to explain the origin of gods, their connections, and the order of the world. Myths have explanatory value as they attempt to provide reasons for existence but do not use critical thinking, and instead often set norms and legitimize the present in the process of re-presenting the divine in storytelling rituals."},{"instruction":"Summarize this text while focusing on \\"what is NAME_1 about?\\": This article is missing information about the creation/production of the series and its critical and commercial reception in Japan.(April 2023)    NAME_1: I'm Now Your Sister! お兄ちゃんはおしまい!

These magnets emit high energy Beta Particles, which are essentially high energy electrons. The idea is that these electrons in motion will generate electricity that can be harnessed through copper wire for practical use.  The generator also includes a Microwave Hot Water Boiler Heating System. This system aims to create a higher energy output than its input by converting thorium/uranium electrons into microwave energy. The system involves a magnetron microwave device and a klystron, both of which have cathodes and anodes plated with thorium and uranium. The magnets used in these devices are made of radioactive cobalt. The operation of the magnetron involves applying a high D-C potential between the cathode and anode, which sets up a radial electric field. This field, combined with other forces, causes electrons to take a spiral path. The oscillations of the magnetron resonators then set up an A-C electric field across the resonator gaps.  The thorium and uranium metal cathode, along with the magnetic metal anode of cobalt plated with radioactive metal, in the magnetron, are expected to increase spiraling reactions when an electric current is applied. This is hoped to cause the magnetron output current to be many times the electric input. The invention also includes electric devices that convert thorium, uranium, cesium, tungsten, nichrome, and argon gas atoms into electric energy. The goal is to use a smaller amount of mechanical energy input to obtain a greater energy output of electric energy.

Despite various recent works devoted to reducing the quadratic cost of such models (as a function of the sequence length n), dealing with ultra long sequences efficiently (e.g., with more than 16K tokens) remains challenging. Applications such as answering questions based on an entire book or summarizing a scientific article are inefficient or infeasible. In this paper, we propose to significantly reduce the dependency of a Transformer model's complexity on n, by compressing the input into a representation whose size r is independent of n at each layer. Specifically, by exploiting the fact that in many tasks, only a small subset of special tokens (we call VIP-tokens) are most relevant to the final prediction, we propose a VIP-token centric compression (Vcc) scheme which selectively compresses the input sequence based on their impact on approximating the representation of these VIP-tokens. Compared with competitive baselines, the proposed algorithm not only is efficient (achieving more than 3× efficiency improvement compared to baselines on 4K and 16K lengths), but also achieves competitive or better performance on a large number of tasks. Further, we show that our algorithm can be scaled to 128K tokens (or more) while consistently offering accuracy improvement.\\"","output":"Transformer models are crucial in natural language processing and computer vision, but struggle with efficiently handling ultra-long sequences, such as summarizing a scientific article or answering questions from a book.

Instead of investing the money, the perpetrator uses the initial deposits to pay out returns to subsequent investors, essentially creating a pyramid scheme. The scheme typically relies on new investors to keep the scam going, with the perpetrator constantly raising more money to pay out to earlier investors. When the fraud collapses, victims are left with nothing, and the perpetrator typically disappears with all of the money. Ponzi schemes are illegal, and many governments have laws in place specifically targeting them. The perpetrator can face criminal charges, and the victims may be able to recover some of their losses through legal action. It is always important to be careful about investing your money and to conduct thorough research to ensure that any investment opportunities are legitimate."},{"instruction":"Summarize what HTML is in 1 sentence, while also including the differences between HTML 4 and HTML 5, the impact of HTML on web development, and providing an example of a complex HTML code that includes tables, forms, and multimedia elements.

Search engines like Google use complex algorithms to determine the relevance and quality of web pages, and proper HTML structure can help improve a page's chances of ranking higher in search results. For example, using semantic HTML elements like headings, lists, and tables can help search engines better understand the content and structure of a web page, while using alt text for images and descriptive text for forms can help improve accessibility and user experience. Additionally, using a consistent and well-structured HTML code can make it easier to maintain and update web pages over time."},{"instruction":"Summarize what the MLcan ecohydrological model does","output":"The MLCan (Multi-Layer Canopy) ecohydrological model is a sophisticated tool used to simulate the interactions between vegetation, the atmosphere, and the soil.

Some of the reasons why it is considered \\"bullshit\\" include: 1. Inaccurate portrayal of events: The movie takes several liberties with the actual events of the Titanic sinking. For example, the character of Rose, played by Kate Winslet, is entirely fictional, and her romantic relationship with Jack, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is not based on any real individuals. 2. Unrealistic love story: The central love story between Rose and Jack is seen by some as overly melodramatic and unrealistic. The rapid development of their relationship and the extreme circumstances they face together are often criticized as being too far-fetched. 3. Simplistic portrayal of social classes: The movie simplifies the complex social dynamics of the time, particularly the class divide on the Titanic. It presents a black-and-white view of the rich as villainous and the poor as virtuous, ignoring the nuances and complexities of the real social structure on board the ship. 4. Inaccurate depiction of the sinking: The movie's portrayal of the sinking itself has been criticized for its inaccuracies. Some argue that the sinking was overly dramatized, with certain scenes and events exaggerated for cinematic effect. 5. Lack of focus on real-life heroes: The movie focuses primarily on the fictional love story, overshadowing the real-life heroes and survivors of the Titanic disaster. Many argue that the film missed an opportunity to highlight the bravery and resilience of those who were actually on board the ship. It's important to note that while the movie may have taken creative liberties, it still resonated with audiences and became a cultural phenomenon. However, for those seeking a more accurate depiction of the Titanic disaster, there are other documentaries and books available that provide a more factual account of the events."},{"instruction":"mmarize with details and quotes this paper \\"Experiences with a Distributed, Scalable, Methodological File System: AnalogicFS\\"","output":"Certainly! \\"Experiences with a Distributed, Scalable, Methodological File System: AnalogicFS\\" is a research paper that discusses the development and implementation of a distributed file system called AnalogicFS.

Many stocks have lower implied volatility and are not ideal for trading, but Meta has higher implied volatility compared to the benchmark (NASDAQ). The article discusses different strategies that can be used for selling premium in Meta, including the 20 Delta option, the iron condor, and the synthetic strangle. It also explains how the trade can be executed in an IRA account or a margin account. The article highlights the usefulness of CVaR for determining the real risk involved in the trade and for assessing additional risk when rolling options. It also mentions the impact of buying power and risk on the type of account used. The iron condor trade in Meta is filled at 5.55, and CVaR is useful for assessing additional risk when rolling options. The trade has a 66% probability of profit (Pop) and generates Theta decay. The Vega indicates a short volatility position, and Delta is beta-weighted to SPY and has slightly negative exposure. The article also discusses the good correlation between Meta and the overall market and how managing the trade involves rolling the untested side when Delta reaches 15. The follow page shows all trades and adjustments made by the team, and other trades include Nvidia and Amazon adjustments.

This organisation, launched just under two months ago, currently has around 25 members among the more radical Russian activists, including NAME_1, NAME_2, NAME_3, NAME_4, NAME_5, and other individuals known for criticising the actions of Russian authorities in this war. They say they are a mixed bag: national-bolsheviks, national-democrats, communists, and monarchists, but any differences between them are forgotten in favour of one goal - \\"to win the war\\". \\"[We are] participants of the SMO, non-systemic politicians, and people who have been criticising the authorities for 20 years and saying it’s going the wrong direction\\", says NAME_6 about current members of the Club. We've seen NAME_1 doing regular lonely livestreams in the past 15 months, but now, he is ready to act: \\"...after a series of non-critical defeats, the Russian army is unable to win the war in its current state [...] measures to improve the situation have not been implemented, are not being implemented, and there","output":"The \\"Angry Patriots Club\\", led by NAME_1, is a group of radical Russian activists preparing for potential political action in Russia. The group, which was formed less than two months ago, includes prominent figures like NAME_2, a known Novorossiya terrorist, and other individuals critical of the Russian authorities' handling of the war. The group's members come from various political backgrounds, but they are united by their common goal to \\"win the war\\". NAME_1, who has been known for his solitary livestreams over the past 15 months, has indicated that the group is ready to act due to the Russian army's inability to win the war and the lack of measures to improve the situation."}]`),_={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function O(a,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(o(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(o(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
