Corden says young audiences are happy to watch shows on a computer. Online move has been criticised by other BBC3 stars including Matt Lucas. Gavin & Stacey was first shown on BBC3 in 2007 before moving to BBC1. Corporation hopes to save £50million a year by making channel online only. The money would be ploughed back into enhancing flagship channel BBC1.","output":"BBC3 To Move Online, Maybe Losing Some Stars in the Process BBC3, the digital youth-focused channel known for hits like Gavin & Stacey and Little Britain, is set to move entirely online next year. The corporation aims to save £50m annually by transitioning the channel to be streamed only through iPlayer. The move has raised some concerns among BBC3’s stars, including Matt Lucas, who criticised the decision on social media. The shift to digital is driven by changing viewing habits as young people increasingly watch on-demand content through their mobiles and computers. In response, BBC3 will be moved to the iPlayer service from 2015, saving the corporation a significant amount of money as overheads like analogue signal costs will no longer be necessary. This follows the steady rise of online shows and streaming services, like Netflix, which have challenged the dominance of traditional television. According to James Corden, the creator and star of Gavin & Stacey, this move could actually benefit the channel by making it more accessible to younger viewers who are already comfortable with watching shows online. Meanwhile, BBC Director-General Tony Hall has argued that the savings from transitioning BBC3 would be used to boost the budget of the flagship channel BBC1, allowing it to create better shows and compete with other networks internationally. However, it is worth noting that BBC3’s programming could be negatively impacted by the move, as some of its stars may decide to move with the channel online, while others may choose to work with other channels instead. Despite these concerns, Hall is optimistic, stating that by moving BBC3 online, the corporation is embracing the future of television and investing in the next generation of viewers."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called back electromotive force (emf). The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply.

British archaeologists consider it the most easterly example of a manmade frontier barrier system in the Roman Empire. University of Exeter experts believe. declassified photographs taken during covert surveillance may herald a. new era for archaeological discovery.","output":"The Trajan's Rampart, a massive border barrier system built by the ancient Romans, is a remarkable feat of engineering that ran 60 kilometres from the Danube to the Black Sea. Measuring 3.8 meters tall and over eight meters thick, it was designed to keep hostile tribes and armies from invading the Roman province of Moesia Inferior. Although much of the rampart has been destroyed or washed away over time, British archaeologists recently identified it as the most easterly example of a man-made frontier barrier system in the Roman Empire. This discovery is significant because it sheds light on the Romans' borders, their military tactics, and their interactions with neighboring tribes. As if that weren't exciting enough, the University of Exeter has revealed that declassified photographs taken during covert surveillance may herald a new era for archaeological discovery. The photographs, which were taken by the US military during the Cold War, show the area around the Black Sea in exceptional detail – including areas that are now inaccessible or destroyed. By analyzing these photographs, researchers hope to find overlooked archaeological sites, map ancient trade routes, and learn more about the peoples who lived in the region. This technology could prove to be a game-changer for archaeologists, giving them access to data that was previously impossible to obtain. In conclusion, the discovery of Trajan's Rampart is a fascinating insight into the Roman Empire's border defenses. Furthermore, the use of declassified surveillance photographs to aid in archaeological research is a creative and innovative approach that could revolutionize the field. As we continue to uncover new artifacts and data from the past, we can gain a deeper understanding of the way civilizations lived and interacted."},{"instruction":"Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Not one of your harderhitting stories, and that's a real strength of this film.

It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

The United States has been a major supplier of military equipment to Bahrain, particularly since the two countries signed a defense cooperation agreement in 1991. While the exact number of tanks and aircraft provided by the US to Bahrain is not publicly available, it is clear that Bahrain received a greater number of aircraft than tanks. The Bahraini Air Force has received F-16 Fighting Falcons, AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters, and UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters from the US, among other aircraft. The F-16 is a multi-role fighter aircraft capable of performing air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, while the AH-1Z is an attack helicopter designed for close air support and anti-armor operations. The UH-60 is typically used for transport and utility missions. These aircraft have helped modernize and enhance the capabilities of the Bahraini military. In contrast, Bahrain's tank fleet mainly consists of M60 Patton tanks, which were originally developed in the United States in the 1950s. While the M60 has been upgraded over the years, it is still an older tank design and is less capable than more modern tanks like the M1 Abrams. Bahrain has also purchased Leopard 2 tanks from Germany, but the number of these tanks is relatively small compared to the overall Bahraini tank fleet. In conclusion, while Bahrain has received both tanks and aircraft from the United States, it is clear that the country has received more aircraft than tanks in recent years. The Bahraini Air Force has benefited from a range of US-supplied aircraft, which have enhanced its operational capabilities and helped modernize the military."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: field, mist, tree","output":"The misty field was encompassed by tall trees."},{"instruction":"hiro Singles to Break Hits Record The Seattle Mariners #39; Ichiro Suzuki broke a longstanding Major League record with his 258th hit of the season, a thirdinning single against the Texas Rangers on Friday.

Now he's Pope. It's possible he had a second lover after Amalia Damonte.","output":"The current pope, Francis, has always been known for his humble and compassionate nature. However, it may surprise some to learn that he was once a fiery tango dancer with a passionate heart. When he was only 12 years old, he fell madly in love with a girl named Amalia Damonte. Unfortunately for young Jorge (the future Pope Francis), Amalia didn't feel the same way. Despite his heartache, Jorge eventually moved on and went on to become a priest and later, a bishop. Now as pope, he even admitted in an interview that his love for tango still burns strongly. But did Jorge ever have another love interest after Amalia? Some speculate that he did, although concrete evidence is scarce. Whatever the case may be, it's clear that the pontiff's heart has always remained tender and full of expression, even as he took on the mantle of leadership for the Catholic Church. Ultimately, whether or not he had another love interest is far less important than the fact that Jorge Bergoglio - now Pope Francis - has devoted his life to serving others, spreading a message of love and compassion across the globe.

You could say that Chelsea's striker is a bit of a throwback to the forwards of my generation – and I love that about him. He plays on the edge, he can be nasty, he is always looking for an edge.\\" Scholes also criticized Skrtel for his role in the incident, saying, \\"I thought that Martin Skrtel was very clever in the way that he provoked Costa. I know what that is like from experience. If you can get your opponent to lash out, then you have the referee on your side.\\" Costa has been a controversial figure since his arrival at Chelsea in 2014, with many accusing him of being overly physical and aggressive on the pitch. However, Scholes believes that this is part of what makes him such a dangerous player. \\"He is a real handful for defenders,\\" Scholes said. \\"He is always in their faces, he is always pushing and shoving, and he is always a threat. I think that this aggression is what makes him a great player, and it would be a real shame if he lost that edge.\\" While Costa's stamp on Emre Can was undoubtedly a moment of indiscipline, it is clear that Scholes feels the Chelsea striker was under pressure from Skrtel throughout the game.

These are the foods and situations that lead to unhealthy eating habits. Once you are able to recognize these triggers, it becomes easier to make conscious decisions about what you are consuming. The first step in identifying your eating triggers is to understand why you are eating. Are you actually hungry, or are you eating out of boredom, stress or emotions? Many people find that they eat mindlessly, without paying attention to their body’s real hunger signals. By tuning in to your own hunger and satiety signals, you can gain more control over your eating habits. Next, take note of the foods that seem to trigger unhealthy eating patterns for you. These might be foods that you can never seem to resist, such as potato chips or ice cream. Identifying these foods can help you avoid them or find healthier alternatives. For example, if you tend to turn to sugary snacks when you are craving something sweet, opt for a piece of fruit instead. It is also important to identify the locations where you are most likely to encounter your trigger foods. Do you tend to indulge in junk food when you are watching TV on the couch? Do you always grab a donut from the break room at work? Once you know where your triggers are, you can take steps to eliminate them from your environment. This might mean keeping unhealthy foods out of your home, or finding a new route to work that doesn’t take you past your favorite fast food restaurant. In conclusion, recognizing your eating triggers is an essential step in maintaining a healthy diet. By understanding why you are eating and what foods trigger unhealthy eating patterns for you, you can gain more control over your eating habits. Removing trigger foods from your home, office and car can help you avoid temptation and make healthier choices.

However, not all tongkat ali supplements are created equal. In this article, we will explain how to choose and use the best tongkat ali supplement for your needs. First and foremost, it is essential to purchase your tongkat ali from a trusted manufacturer. The market is flooded with fake or low-quality products that will not provide the desired results. Look for a reputable company that uses high-quality ingredients and has good customer reviews. When choosing a tongkat ali supplement, look for a 100:1-strength extract. This means that 100 grams of the herb were used to make one gram of the extract. The higher the ratio, the more potent the supplement will be. Additionally, look for a supplement that was extracted with water rather than ethanol. While ethanol extraction is faster and cheaper, it can damage some of the beneficial compounds in tongkat ali. Water extraction is slower and more expensive, but it produces a better-quality extract. One way to make sure that you have a genuine tongkat ali supplement is to taste it. Tongkat ali is famous for its extreme bitterness, so if your supplement does not have a strong bitter taste, it is likely fake or low-quality. When it comes to dosage, it is recommended not to take more than 200-300mg of tongkat ali per day. Taking more than that can cause side effects such as restlessness, anxiety, and high blood pressure. It is also best to take tongkat ali capsules between meals to enhance its absorption. In summary, choosing and using the best tongkat ali supplement requires a bit of research and caution. Look for a trusted manufacturer, a 100:1-strength water-extracted supplement, and make sure it tastes extremely bitter.

Before purchasing a new jacket, it's important to check your height and weight, and also wear a dress shirt during measuring to ensure that the jacket will fit over it. To get started with measuring, begin by measuring shoulder-to-shoulder to get your over-arm measurement. This involves placing the measuring tape at the tip of your shoulder on one side, then pulling it across to the tip of your shoulder on the other side. This will give you a measurement that is approximately where the seams of the jacket should sit. Next, raise your arms and measure around the widest part of your chest, making sure that the measuring tape is level and not too tight. This measurement will help you select the appropriate chest size for your jacket. Measuring your arm length is also important to ensure that the jacket sleeves fit correctly. With your arm bent at a 90-degree angle, measure from your shoulder down to your wrist, and make sure to account for any variance in arm length between your left and right arms. The jacket length is also an essential measurement to take. To get this measurement, measure from the base of your neck down to your thumb, keeping the measuring tape in line with your body. This measurement should give you a good idea of how long the jacket should be, so that it sits properly on your body. Lastly, measure around your neck under your Adam's apple to determine your neck size. This will help ensure that your jacket's collar fits comfortably. Overall, taking accurate measurements is an essential part of achieving the perfect jacket fit. By measuring shoulder-to-shoulder, chest, arm length, jacket length, and neck, you can ensure that your jacket will fit you perfectly and make you feel confident and comfortable."},{"instruction":"he disease can be easily cured if it is not cured but it can be serious, such as blindness that occurs as a complication of conjunctivitis with chlamydia.

In the most general case, polarization is elliptical, meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time. Two special cases are linear polarization (the ellipse collapses into a line) as we have discussed above, and circular polarization (in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal). In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation. Circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as righthanded or lefthanded using the thumb in the direction of the propagation rule. Note that for circular polarization, optical researchers use the opposite right hand rule from the one used by radio engineers.

Each style has its own unique sound, so you need to choose one that matches your playing style and music genre. After selecting a body style, you need to look at the type of wood used for the guitar's construction. This is known as tone woods. Generally, the quality of the wood used on a guitar will determine the guitar's sound and resonance. Popular tone woods include mahogany, maple, ash, and rosewood. One of the best ways to get inspiration for your guitar playing is to look to your guitar heroes. This can help you learn new techniques and try different styles you may not have considered before. There are many famous guitarists to choose from, but it's important to pick a favorite who speaks to your music philosophy and playing style. Lastly, don’t be afraid of deals. Sometimes, you can find affordable and high-quality guitars on sales or secondhand markets. You don't need to spend thousands of dollars to find a guitar that suits your playing style and preferences.

Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19thcentury development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses. Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.

Money was routed from Ireland into Cayman Islands subsidiary.","output":"A recent investigation has revealed that a British business has been utilizing its Irish office to avoid tax liability in the UK. The company in question has reportedly routed earnings from its UK operations to its Irish office and used various tax avoidance measures to keep its tax bill in the UK to less than £240,000. According to the investigation, the company then funneled the money from its Irish office into a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands. This tactic has enabled the company to reduce its overall tax liability significantly and raises questions about its ethical practices. The use of tax havens and other tax avoidance measures by companies has been a contentious issue in recent years, with many criticizing the lack of transparency and fairness in the global tax system. While many companies argue that they are simply taking advantage of legal loopholes, others argue that tax avoidance schemes represent a serious threat to public finances and social justice. The revelations about this company's tax affairs are likely to add fuel to the ongoing debate about tax avoidance and the need for international tax reform. Many are calling for greater transparency in corporate tax affairs and the introduction of measures to ensure that companies pay their fair share of tax in the countries where they operate.

The religion has been criticized for its two witness rule for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:1517, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands.

Anderson says the policies protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.

Villarreal sacked Ernesto Valverde following a 1-1 draw with Almeria, and have appointed reserve coach Juan Carlos Garrido as his replacement until the end of the season. Meanwhile, Real Valladolid dismissed manager Jose Luis Mendilibar due to poor results, and have installed reserve-team coach Onesimo Sanchez as his replacement. For Villarreal, the decision to sack Valverde came after a run of disappointing results that had seen the team fall behind in the race for European places. Despite an early lead against Almeria, Villarreal were unable to hold on for the win, leading to Valverde's dismissal. Garrido, who previously managed the team from 2010 to 2012, will be tasked with turning things around over the coming months. At Real Valladolid, the decision to replace Mendilibar comes after a similarly disappointing run of results. The club has been struggling near the bottom of the league table, and has decided to make a change in the hopes of avoiding relegation. Sanchez, who has previously coached the team's youth and reserve sides, will be given the chance to make an impact and turn things around. Both clubs will be hoping that their new appointments will be able to make a positive impact and help to turn things around. With the season now in its final stretch, there is little time left for either team to salvage their campaigns, but the hope is that the new managers will be able to bring fresh ideas and renewed energy to their respective sides.

This is a consequence of the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetics.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The Justice Department has blocked a Texas law that required voters to show a photo ID at the polling place. The move was described by Texas Governor Rick Perry as an example of \\"federal overreach.\\" Proponents of the law argued that it was necessary to prevent voter fraud, but the Justice Department said that there was little evidence of \\"in-person voter impersonation.\\" The department had previously blocked a similar voter ID law in South Carolina in December. Critics of voter ID laws argue that they disproportionately affect minority and low-income voters, who may not have access to the required forms of identification. Supporters argue that they are necessary to prevent voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the electoral process. The decision by the Justice Department is likely to be seen as a victory by opponents of voter ID laws. However, the issue is far from settled. Other states are considering similar laws, and legal challenges to existing laws are likely to continue. Ultimately, the question of whether voter ID laws are necessary to prevent fraud or a form of voter suppression will likely be decided by the courts. In the meantime, the debate over voter ID laws will continue to be a contentious issue in American politics."},{"instruction":"Math problem: Solve 163*o 681*o 1536 16076 = 0 for o.

Water Daily Eggplants need consistent moisture to grow well. Water your plants deeply each day to keep the soil evenly moist. 3. Use Liquid Fertilizer Eggplants are heavy feeders and benefit from regular doses of fertilizer. Use a liquid fertilizer once every one or two weeks to provide your plants with the nutrients they need. 4. Monitor Soil pH Eggplants prefer a slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. Test your soil regularly to ensure it stays within this range. 5. Stake your Plants Eggplants can grow quite tall and may become top-heavy. Use a stake to tie your plants up and promote upward growth. This will also help prevent breakage as the fruits begin to develop. 6. Watch for Pests Eggplants are prone to a variety of pests, including aphids, spider mites, and flea beetles. Inspect your plants regularly and take action if you notice any signs of infestation. 7.

What in other countries is called hunting is called shooting (birds) or stalking (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or longdogs), such as greyhounds, may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink. Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.

Several cities are recognizing the need for a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable mode of transportation, and are working hard to make it happen. The trend of adding trolley lines and new transit centers has caught on, and more cities are making investments in their public transportation infrastructure to meet the demands of the modern age. Regional railroads lines are also on the rise, with many proposed projects in the works. In Texas, a proposed expansion of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) light rail system will extend its reach by more than 26 miles. In Illinois, a new 1.3 billion bridge over the Mississippi River will soon allow Amtrak to travel at higher speeds through the area.

After the French and Indian War, the Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement for Great Britain's thirteen original colonies in North America to east of the summit line of the mountains (except in the northern regions where the Great Lakes formed the boundary). Although the line was adjusted several times to take frontier settlements into account and was impossible to enforce as law, it was strongly resented by backcountry settlers throughout the Appalachians. The Proclamation Line can be seen as one of the grievances which led to the American Revolutionary War. Many frontier settlers held that the defeat of the French opened the land west of the mountains to English settlement, only to find settlement barred by the British King's proclamation. The backcountry settlers who fought in the Illinois campaign of George Rogers Clark were motivated to secure their settlement of Kentucky.

As eggs age, the whites become thinner and the yolks become flatter, making it harder to achieve the perfect boiled egg. Next, boil water in a large saucepan. It's important to use a large enough pan to ensure that the eggs have plenty of room to move around while cooking. Once the water is boiling, carefully lower the eggs into the water. Before adding the eggs to the water, it's a good idea to whisk in a little liquid to help prevent the eggs from cracking. A splash of vinegar or lemon juice will do the trick. This step is especially important if the eggs are not fresh, as the whites will be more fragile. To ensure even cooking, place the bowl containing the eggs inside the saucepan. Whisk the eggs constantly until the temperature of the water drops. This will take around ten to twelve minutes for a medium-sized egg. Once the eggs are cooked to perfection, remove them from the water immediately and peel them while still hot. Boiled eggs can be enjoyed on their own, used in salads, or turned into delicious deviled eggs. By following these simple steps, you can easily achieve perfectly boiled eggs every time. Remember to start with fresh eggs, use a large saucepan, and whisk in a little liquid before cooking. With a little practice, you'll be able to make boiled eggs that are the envy of all your friends and family."},{"instruction":"What is the title of this article: For all iPods released in 2006 and earlier, some equalizer (EQ) sound settings would distort the bass sound far too easily, even on undemanding songs.

Wearing a bra that doesn't fit properly can not only be uncomfortable but can also affect the way your clothes fit. Knowing how to measure yourself for a bra is the first step to finding the right size. To measure yourself for a bra, start by putting on a non-padded bra if you have one. Padded bras can add extra bulk, which can skew your measurements. Once you've put on your bra, measure under your bust and calculate your band size. Use a soft tape measure to measure the distance around the bottom of your bust, directly under your breasts. Round this measurement to the nearest whole number. This number will be your band size. Next, measure around your bust at the fullest point. Make sure the tape measure is straight and parallel to the floor. Round this measurement to the nearest whole number, which will be your bust size. To determine your cup size, subtract your under bust measurement from your bust size. The difference between the two measurements corresponds to the following cup sizes: - 0 inches: AA - 1 inch: A - 2 inches: B - 3 inches: C - 4 inches: D - 5 inches: DD (also known as E) - 6 inches: DDD (also known as F) - 7 inches: DDDD (also known as G) For example, if your band size is 32 inches and your bust measurement is 36 inches, the difference between the two is 4 inches, which means you are a D cup.

The rider was thrown from the bull and struck by the animal in the chest, causing fatal injuries. In a separate incident also at the rodeo, a 16-year-old girl was kicked at least once in the chest by a bull. Fortunately, she survived the incident and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. This tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the inherent dangers associated with rodeo events. While bull riding can be a thrilling sport to watch, it is not without risks. Participants must sign waivers acknowledging the potential dangers and accepting responsibility for any injuries sustained during the event. Despite these precautions, accidents can happen, and the consequences can be devastating. Bull riding is a sport that requires a high level of skill and physical fitness. The riders must be able to maintain their balance and control while the powerful animals buck and spin beneath them. The bulls are also fitted with straps that increase their hostility, making the ride even more challenging. While this added excitement may be exhilarating for spectators, it also increases the likelihood of injury. In light of this tragic event, it is important for rodeo organizers and participants to re-examine their safety protocols and take all necessary precautions to prevent further accidents. This includes providing adequate protective gear for riders, such as helmets and chest protectors, and ensuring that the animals are well-trained and properly cared for. In conclusion, the loss of the bull rider and the injury of the teenage girl are reminders that safety must be the top priority at rodeo events. While the thrill of the ride can be enticing, it is important to take all necessary precautions to prevent injuries and fatalities. Only then can we truly enjoy the excitement and spectacle of bull riding in a responsible and safe manner."},{"instruction":"The properties of matter depend on the types of atoms that matter is made of.
