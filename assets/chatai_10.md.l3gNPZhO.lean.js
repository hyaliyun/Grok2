By poetry I mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if a novel has been adapted page by page to screen. In this sense, the film achieves depths many cannot; but it is also rather slow at other times, undercutting the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui.

Turn your wrist inward. Release your grip on the ball. Let your pointer finger run down the inside of the ball.","output":"If you are a baseball pitcher, you would definitely be familiar with the importance of a good throw. A good throw requires the right technique and perfect execution. One of the most important aspects of a good pitch is the release. To achieve a good release, it is important to follow the correct method. The first step in the correct release is to lean into the pitch. This means that you need to push your body weight forward as you throw. This helps you generate more power and increase the speed of the ball. If you do not lean into the pitch, your throw may be lacking in power and speed. The next step is to turn your wrist inward. This means that your wrist should be rotated towards your body as you release the ball. By turning your wrist inward, you can achieve a better grip on the ball, and it can improve the rotation of the ball as it leaves your hand. This helps create a more accurate and powerful throw. Once you have turned your wrist, the next step is to release your grip on the ball. It may sound obvious, but this is often an overlooked aspect of the pitch. You should let the ball roll off your fingers and release it with a smooth motion. This helps to maintain the speed and accuracy of the ball as it travels towards the batter. Finally, let your pointer finger run down the inside of the ball. As the ball leaves your fingers, your pointer finger should be running down the inside of the ball. This helps improve the accuracy and speed of the throw as it helps in creating an ideal spin. In conclusion, a good pitch requires the right technique, body position, and proper execution. Following the above steps can help you achieve a good release and ultimately result in a better pitch. Keep practicing and perfecting your technique to achieve better results."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: seve ballesteros and nick faldo , two keys in the rise of europe to ryder cup parity with the united states , were elected to the world golf hall of fame in voting announced thursday .","output":"Ballesteros and Faldo were elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame on Thursday for their contribution in bringing Europe to Ryder Cup parity with the United States."},{"instruction":"(Rolling Stone What are the important parts of this article?","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot access the current articles of \\"Rolling Stone\\" as they keep changing regularly.

This can be anything from walking, jogging, or cycling to swimming, dancing, or even gardening. The key is to find an activity that you find enjoyable so that you're more likely to stick with it. Once you've chosen an activity, it's important to start slowly. If you're new to exercise or haven't been active for a while, jumping into a strenuous workout routine can be overwhelming and even dangerous. Instead, start with low-impact activities like walking or yoga and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. As you become more comfortable with your chosen activity, challenge yourself to take on more physical activity each week. This could mean increasing the frequency, duration, or intensity of your workouts. Don't be afraid to mix things up and try different activities to keep things interesting and challenging. Remember, the goal is not to become a fitness guru overnight but to build a healthy and sustainable exercise routine that will benefit your mind and body in the long run.

Some babies may find stimuli overwhelming and may need peace and quiet to calm down. So, eliminate all stimuli if your baby doesn’t calm down with noise. You can darken the room, remove any toys or flashy objects, and create a peaceful and calm environment for them.

If you want to see your hydrangeas grow and blossom to their full potential, it is essential to maintain a height of 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3.0 m). Achieving an optimal height can be done through proper pruning techniques.

Instead, let the hydrangea grow and establish itself before pruning. Once the shrub has reached maturity, you can then begin pruning to maintain a compact shape. For older hydrangeas, pruning becomes crucial to rejuvenate the plant. Regular pruning can prompt the growth of new branches, leading to more beautiful blooms. It is recommended to prune the hydrangea in late winter or early spring when the plant is still dormant. Be sure to remove any dead or odd-growing branches to tidy up the shrub.

The trio was accused of deliberately bowling no-balls at specific times during the fourth Test match at Lord's cricket ground in 2010 in exchange for financial rewards. The case has come under renewed scrutiny in recent years following doubts over the credibility of 'Fake Sheik' reporter Mazher Mahmood, who was instrumental in the prosecution of the three players. Mahmood was himself later found guilty of perverting the course of justice in an unrelated case, casting doubt on the evidence he provided in the cricketing scandal. The three players, who received bans from international cricket as well as prison sentences, have maintained their innocence throughout. However, their reputations have been irrevocably tarnished by the scandal. The case has highlighted the problem of corruption in cricket and the need for greater vigilance in rooting out malpractice in the sport. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has introduced a number of measures to combat corruption, including the use of undercover operatives to expose illegal activities. However, the scandal also raises broader questions about the role of sport in society and the pressures faced by young athletes to succeed at all costs.

In this article, we will discuss some essential tips for growing and maintaining your collard greens. Firstly, watering is crucial for collard greens. They need consistent moisture but not to be waterlogged. A good soak a few times a week is appropriate, but more in extremely hot and dry weather. You can also consider applying a layer of mulch to retain moisture and reduce water stress. Secondly, pests can be the biggest enemy of collard greens. Caterpillars, aphids, and other insects can quickly destroy your plants. Prevent this by keeping vigilant and treating any sign of infestation promptly. Consider using organic pesticides or traps to fend off pests. Thirdly, diseases can be another problem. Collard greens are susceptible to diseases like black rot or clubroot, which can lead to plant death. Prioritize good sanitation, proper crop rotation, and avoid planting with other susceptible plants to prevent disease spread. Fourthly, it's best to wait until after a light frost to harvest collard greens. This improves taste and texture, as the frost converts starches to sugar. Be sure to remove any frost-damaged leaves, and clip the whole plant or individual leaves as needed. Finally, it's worth considering replanting collard greens the next year if resources and space permit. This can help maintain a regular supply of fresh greens and keep the soil healthy through crop rotation. In conclusion, growing collard greens takes a little effort, but with the right care, you will enjoy a healthy and delicious crop all year round. Follow these tips for watering, pest control, disease prevention, harvesting, and replanting. And before you know it, you'll have a thriving collard greens bed in your backyard."},{"instruction":"Math problem: Solve 189018 = 5082*o 376*o + 5795*o for o.

The fiveminute film showed the men being marched along a beach. The victims are then shown lined up and beheaded in sequence. Experts believe the Egyptian victims were not murdered at the beach. Instead, they were murdered elsewhere with the background added later. The shocking scene of the sea turning red is believed to be special effects. The scene where the sea turns red with blood is also thought to be faked.","output":"Last week, Isis released a horrifying video showcasing the murder of 21 Coptic Christians. The five-minute film portrays the men being led to a beach before being lined up and beheaded one by one. However, experts have shed light on the fact that the victims were not killed at the beach as shown in the video, but rather somewhere else with the beach scene being artificially created. The scene of the sea turning red, indicating the blood of the victims, is also believed to be a result of special effects. This revelation leads us to contemplate the motives and objectives of Isis behind fabricating the beach scene. It raises the question of whether these staged scenes are an attempt by the group to sway public opinion and create a more graphic image of their reign of terror. It seems that the method of violence and the emotive stimulation in the video would help them to achieve this objective, especially given their desire to create fear and intimidate their enemies. Moreover, this raises another concern - that of media manipulation by a group that is known for its propaganda. It's no surprise that Isis pays great attention to its image, and we have been seeing a strategically crafted media campaign that rebrands the group as more than a terrorist organization. There have been reports of Isis establishing its website and creating a highly organized virtual propaganda machinery that delivers its message globally. The question is, how much of the content is genuine, and how much is a fabrication? To conclude, such videos only prove that the ISIS is intent on carrying out violent acts on innocent civilians. While the staged beach scene creates further terror, the central and undisputed truth remains that people are being killed in the most brutal fashion. It's high time that the international community takes a firmer stance against such barbarism and ensures that the victims are not forgotten."},{"instruction":"Ordered from the drive thru, just basic order, roast beef meal and an additional jr roast beef.

They competed against each other in several territories, including the Americas. In terms of troop numbers, it is important to note that both empires had large armies, although the number of troops varied by region and time. However, it is worth noting that, in general, the British had fewer troops than the Spanish. During the seventeenth century, the British colonies in North America relied heavily on militia forces rather than a standing army. This meant that British forces were not as numerous or as well trained as Spanish forces. Additionally, the British relied on their navy for defense and conquest more than the Spanish did. This emphasis on naval power meant that the British allocated fewer resources to their land forces. Meanwhile, the Spanish were more focused on land-based military campaigns, and as such, they invested more in their land forces. In the eighteenth century, the British increased their army size to compete with the French, but they still did not match the Spanish in terms of troop numbers.

First, be aware of the time and effort that goes into collecting and processing them. There are also some risks to your garden that you should consider, such as the possibility of attracting rodents. One option is to simply collect fallen walnuts from the ground. However, keep in mind that they may not be as fresh or high quality as those you can purchase. If you want to ensure the best flavor and texture, it might be worth buying walnuts instead. If you do decide to collect your own walnuts, you'll need to remove the outer husks. This step is optional, but it can help prevent mold and decay during storage. One easy way to do this is to simply run the nuts over with a car tire or other heavy object. Once you've removed the husks, you'll need to keep the nuts moist for 90-120 days over the winter. This process, known as stratification, helps the nuts germinate and develop properly. You can use a variety of methods to achieve this, such as storing them in damp sand or peat moss.

It is the time when the body rests and recharges to prepare for the next day. However, for people experiencing joint pain, sleeping can be challenging as it exacerbates their discomfort. Fortunately, there are ways to alleviate joint pain during sleep. One practical tip is to favor your side. Sleeping on your side, particularly on the side opposite to the painful joint, distributes your body weight evenly, providing relief to the joint. To make side sleeping more comfortable, lean back on a pillow or blanket to support your upper back and shoulders. This position reduces strain on the spine and improves spinal alignment, reducing discomfort in the joints. It is also essential to alternate sleeping on your back. Sleeping on your back ensures that your spine and body are in a neutral position, taking the pressure off your joints. Moreover, it prevents muscle imbalances and reduces the risk of developing new joint problems. Finally, placing a pad under the joint that is causing pain can also offer relief. The cushioning provides support, reducing the pressure applied to the joint. This way, the joint can rest and heal without any external aggravation. In conclusion, joint pain can make sleeping uncomfortable, but it does not have to be. Favoring your side, alternating by sleeping on your back, and placing pads under the joint can all help relieve joint pain, allowing you to sleep comfortably and wake up refreshed."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent were not under the age of 18?","output":"I'm sorry, but I am unable to write an article without additional information or context.

Shearer was already one of the highest-paid footballers in the world at the time, earning £45,000 per week. However, during negotiations, he was able to secure an increase in his salary that would see him earn £75,000 per week. To calculate how much more Shearer received during the pay dispute than he was making before, we can subtract his original salary from his new salary. £75,000 - £45,000 = £30,000 Therefore, Shearer received an extra £30,000 per week during the pay dispute.

Says he would rather the country was poorer than open doors to 5million. Admits party does not have immigration policy but discussed it for 'hours' Vince Cable claims David Cameron will miss target to cut net migration.","output":"UK Independence Party Leader Nigel Farage has denied that immigration has brought any benefits, stating that he would rather see the country become poorer than open its doors to five million immigrants. Despite admitting that his party does not currently have a comprehensive immigration policy, Farage claims that UKIP has spent hours discussing the subject. In contrast, Liberal Democrat Vince Cable has claimed that Prime Minister David Cameron will miss his target to cut net migration. This comes amid concerns that immigrants are putting pressure on public services and driving down wages. Farage's comments have sparked controversy, with many arguing that immigration has brought a wealth of benefits to the UK. The country has long been a melting pot of cultures, and immigrants have played a vital role in shaping its economic and cultural landscape. However, the issue of immigration remains a contentious one, with many feeling that the government has failed to adequately address the challenges posed by the influx of migrants. With the UK set to leave the European Union, the debate around immigration is likely to intensify in the coming years. Despite his controversial views, Farage's stance on immigration is likely to resonate with many voters who feel that their concerns have been ignored by mainstream politicians. As the UK continues to grapple with the effects of globalisation and demographic change, the issue of immigration is unlikely to go away anytime soon."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

This can involve simply being present and actively listening to your child or working together to find a solution to a problem. In order to effectively back up your words with actions, it is important to be consistent. Consistency in your words and actions will help your child learn to trust you and feel more secure in their relationship with you. This can be particularly important for children who have experienced trauma or other difficult situations. Ultimately, the key to effectively communicating with your child during difficult moments is to remain calm, respond quickly and simply, acknowledge their feelings, and back up your words with actions.

Contemporary chroniclers state that John was sinfully lustful and lacking in piety. It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses, but chroniclers complained that John's mistresses were married noblewomen, which was considered unacceptable. John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester, and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen. John's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of Angoulême is less clear, however. None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried, and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point, although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period. The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour.[nb 14] How many children did John have with mistresses during his first marriage?","output":"John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage."},{"instruction":"What was the name of the number one hit single by Spitting Image in 1986????","output":"The name of the number one hit single by Spitting Image in 1986 was \\"The Chicken Song\\"."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Blue Spice food French; Blue Spice priceRange more than £30; Blue Spice area riverside","output":"Blue Spice is a French-inspired restaurant serving delicious food with a blue-hued ambiance located in the picturesque riverside area, and though their price range is more than £30, their exquisite dishes and delightful atmosphere are worth every penny."},{"instruction":"Select the topic that this about: GermanAmerican auto maker DaimlerChrysler AG said Thursday it will invest 210 million to update an assembly plant in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila.

These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God.

Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement.

Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an arrow of time, and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modeled by a parameter in the system being analyzed, where there is no proper time: the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone). In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above.

However, one major challenge that has arisen is the need for a common language, or protocol, that will ensure all these devices can work together seamlessly. According to experts, the proliferation of connected devices represents the third major revolution of the internet. The first revolution was the rise of basic internet connectivity, while the second was the development of the web and the creation of new platforms for sharing information and conducting business. Now, the IoT is poised to take this connectivity to a whole new level, by allowing for an unprecedented degree of control over our homes, vehicles, and personal devices. However, without a shared protocol, these devices run the risk of becoming fragmented and disconnected, limiting their potential usefulness. To solve this problem, one company has taken on the ambitious task of developing a universal language for the IoT. Their solution aims to enable devices to communicate with each other seamlessly, regardless of the brand or model. The result will be a fully connected ecosystem of devices that can work together to create new and innovative solutions for our modern lifestyles. With the IoT poised to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us, it's clear that a common language is crucial for ensuring the success of this new paradigm. Whether through the efforts of individual companies or industry-wide initiatives, we can certainly expect to see more progress towards this goal in the coming years.

The protagonist is scriptwriter Bart Klever who fights persistently with his new text  which is, at the same time, the screenplay of the film we're watching. In the movie Bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film Bart's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme, as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space, light, colours and a couple of cats. The outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker's interventions, which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment. The constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise: What is truth' and what illusion' ? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest?

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19thcentury concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.

With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence.

It is not, however, the oldest surviving English settlement in North America or Canada, having been preceded by the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids, founded in 1610, and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace, founded in 1618. In fact, although English fishermen had begun setting up seasonal camps in Newfoundland in the 16th Century, they were expressly forbidden by the British government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast, hence the town of St. John's was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s at the earliest. Other permanent English settlements in the Americas that predate St. John's include: St. George's, Bermuda (1612) and Jamestown, Virginia (1607).

Find the square root of a perfect square. Factor numbers into perfect squares. Factor a number with more than one perfect square.","output":"Memorizing perfect squares can be a helpful tool in mathematics. Perfect squares are numbers that can be expressed as the square of an integer. Examples of perfect squares include 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36. By memorizing these values, it becomes easier to find the square root of perfect squares without having to use a calculator. To find the square root of a perfect square, simply remember the square root value of the perfect square. For instance, to find the square root of 25, one can remember that the square root of 25 is 5. Similarly, if you want to find the square root of 36, recall that the square root of 36 is 6. This technique helps to save time and effort in calculations. Another useful application of memorizing perfect squares is in factoring numbers. When factoring, one can decompose a number into its prime factors. However, factoring numbers into perfect squares can also be useful. For example, consider factoring the number 24 into perfect squares. First, it should be broken down into its prime factors: 2 x 2 x 2 x 3. Then, group the 2s together, as they are a perfect square, and express this group as the perfect square of 2 x 2. The remaining factor, 3, is not a perfect square. Therefore, the final factored form of 24 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 3, which can also be expressed as 2² × 3. Some numbers can have more than one perfect square factor. In these instances, the process of factoring becomes more complicated. However, remembering the perfect squares can simplify the process. For instance, consider the number 72. Its prime factorization is 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3, which can be expressed as 2³ x 3². The presence of two perfect square factors in 72 allows for it to be expressed as the product of two perfect squares: 2² x 3² x 2. In conclusion, memorizing perfect squares and understanding how to apply them in mathematical calculations and factoring can save a lot of time and effort. By committing these values to memory, one can simplify complex calculations and factorization processes with ease."},{"instruction":"the premise Darkskinned man is lying down with his hands folded and a paper laying on him. true if The man is laying down.?

Asked about the product's name Dancia replied that 'white means pure' Critics have branded the product an 'abomination', warning it will harm the self confidence of 'girls of colour' by making them ashamed of dark skin. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Controversy has erupted over the launch of Whitenicious, a new beauty cream created by African pop singer Dencia. While she claims it is a dark spot remover that will lighten blemishes in just seven days, the advertising campaign shows her with her entire body appearing lighter. When asked about the product's name, Dancia replied that \\"white means pure.\\" Critics have been quick to react, branding the product an \\"abomination\\" and warning that it will harm the self-confidence of girls of colour by making them ashamed of their dark skin. The backlash from the launch of Whitenicious highlights the complex issues surrounding skin lightening in countries with a history of colourism. While many people view whiter skin as a status symbol or as more attractive, dark-skinned people often face discrimination and unfair treatment. The idea that a product can \\"fix\\" dark skin perpetuates the idea that there is something inherently wrong with it. Dencia's use of the word \\"white\\" in the product's name only further reinforces these harmful stereotypes. The idea that white equals pure implies that darker-skinned people are somehow impure or dirty. This kind of messaging can have devastating consequences on the self-esteem and self-worth of people who have been marginalized for their skin colour. Critics worry that the launch of products like Whitenicious will only further reinforce these negative attitudes. By promoting the idea that lighter skin is better, companies like Dencia's are promoting harmful stereotypes and perpetuating the idea that dark skin is somehow unacceptable. The consequences of this kind of thinking can be seen in communities around the world, where people bleach their skin in an effort to fit in or be more accepted. In the end, the launch of Whitenicious is a reminder that we still have a long way to go in terms of breaking down the barriers of colourism. While beauty brands have a responsibility to create products that meet the diverse needs of all consumers, they also have a responsibility to reject messaging that reinforces harmful stereotypes. As consumers, we have a responsibility to educate ourselves and make informed purchasing decisions that promote diversity and inclusivity. Only then can we begin to move towards a more equal, just, and beautiful world."},{"instruction":"Solve 9037 = 244*k 574*k 419*k 38725 for k..

One of the best ways to begin is by obtaining a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification. This certification verifies that you have the foundational skills necessary for a career in IT. However, it's important to take it one step further and also verify your skills as a CompTIA A+ Technician. The A+ certification is a globally recognized certification that validates your knowledge of best practices for troubleshooting, configuring, and maintaining computer hardware and software. Once you have your foundational certifications, it's essential that you continue to develop your networking skills with the CompTIA Network+ certification. This certification validates your knowledge of fundamental networking concepts such as configuring, managing, and troubleshooting networks. If you have the resources, it's recommended that you take online training courses to supplement your certification studies. These courses offer hands-on experience and help you develop practical skills that you'll need in the workplace. However, if you're on a budget, self-prep books and practice questions can be just as effective in preparing you for certification exams.

Property owners have a responsibility to ensure that their properties are safe for visitors and passersby. This includes regular maintenance and upkeep of the premises.

They make a beautiful addition to any garden, and what better way to enjoy their beauty and fragrance than by growing them in your own home. Planting tulips indoors is a fun and easy project that anyone can try. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to plant tulips indoors. The first step in planting tulips indoors is to select a pot that is at least 8.5 inches (22 cm) in diameter and has drainage holes. This is important because tulip bulbs need good drainage to prevent rotting. Once you have the right pot, fill it halfway with a perlite and vermiculite potting mix. This type of soil helps to hold water while providing adequate drainage. Next, push the bulbs into the soil, spacing them 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Make sure the bulbs are planted with their pointed ends facing upward. Cover the bulbs with 5-8 inches (13-20 cm) of soil, leaving the tips of the bulbs exposed. If you want to create a layered effect, you can add additional bulbs on top of the first layer of bulbs. Just make sure to space them out evenly, and cover them with soil. After planting your tulip bulbs, give them a good watering. This will help to settle the soil and start the growing process. Once the bulbs are planted, they need to be left in a cool area for 12-16 weeks. This is known as the cold treatment or chilling period. During this time, it's important to keep the bulbs in a place with consistent temperatures without risking freezing and thawing. This is crucial to the success of the growing process. After the 12-16 week chilling period is over, move the tulips to an area that's at least 60-70°F (16-21°C). Make sure the area receives plenty of sunlight, as tulips need sunlight to grow properly. Wait 1-3 weeks for your tulips to start blooming. During this time, it's essential to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. In conclusion, planting tulips indoors is a fun and rewarding project that anyone can do. Follow these simple steps, and you'll have beautiful tulips blooming in your home in no time.

Initially the Canal was opposed by the British; but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the jugular vein of the Empire.

According to a report by the United States Census Bureau, about 10% of households in the United States had someone living alone who was under 65 years old as of 2018. This means that out of every ten households, one had an individual under the age of 65 living alone. While the percentage may seem small, it represents a significant number of individuals. In 2018, there were 125 million households in the United States, which means that 12.5 million households had someone living alone who was under 65 years old. This figure has significant implications for policymakers and social scientists alike, as it highlights the importance of understanding the needs and challenges facing single individuals who do not have the support of a family unit. The reasons for individuals living alone vary, from being single and not being in a relationship to having lost a partner or spouse. Also, some individuals may choose to live alone for personal reasons, such as wanting independence and privacy. However, living alone can come with many social, economic, and health-related challenges, including isolation, loneliness, and financial insecurity. Policymakers and social scientists need to address these issues and work to improve the standard of living for individuals living alone. Possible solutions include the provision of affordable housing, access to healthcare and social services, and the creation of community-based initiatives that promote socialization and interaction. In conclusion, approximately 10% of households in the United States had someone living alone who was under 65 years old as of 2018. While this may seem like a small percentage, it represents a significant number of individuals who may face challenges related to social, economic, and health-related issues.

Make a photo frame with pictures that they can swap out.","output":"Expressing love can be done in many ways, but sometimes simple gestures can make the most impact. Writing a heartfelt love letter, for instance, can touch someone's heart in ways that words spoken in person cannot. Putting one's emotions in writing can create a lasting memory that can be savored for years to come. It doesn't have to be long, just sincere and from the heart. Another way to express love is by making a mixtape. Music is a powerful tool that can evoke strong emotions and memories. Choosing songs that mean something to both parties can create a playlist that is both nostalgic and sentimental. It's a gift that keeps on giving, as it can be played over and over, reminding the recipient of the love that was shared. Lastly, a photo frame with pictures that can be swapped out is another way to express love. Selecting photos that capture special moments and memories can create a visual representation of the love that was shared. The frame can be placed in a prominent location, serving as a reminder of the love that was shared and as a reflection of the life that was built together. With new photos added over time, the frame will continue to evolve and grow. In conclusion, love can be expressed in many ways, but sincerity and thoughtfulness are key. By taking the time to write a heartfelt love letter, compiling a mixtape, or creating a photo frame, one can create lasting memories that will be treasured for years to come."},{"instruction":"Sentence: 1089 Tama has an escape velocity of 0.0068 kilometres per second, a temperature of 179 kelvins and an apoapsis of 373513000.0 kilometres.

Reheat the cauliflower when you're ready to use it.","output":"Freezing cauliflower is a great way to keep it fresh for longer periods of time. If you have leftover cauliflower or have bought it in bulk, portioning it into freezer-safe containers and then freezing it is the way to go. It's an easy process to follow. First, wash the cauliflower and remove any leaves or debris. Then, cut it into small florets or slices. This makes it easier to reheat later on. Make sure you remove as much excess moisture as possible. Next, take your freezer-safe containers and portion the cauliflower into them. Be sure to leave some space at the top, about an inch or two, to allow for expansion as the cauliflower freezes. Once the cauliflower is in the containers, cover them with a lid or plastic wrap. Make sure they are sealed tightly to avoid freezer burn. Then, label the containers with the date of freezing. This is important as you can keep track of how long it has been in the freezer. After labeling, put the containers in the freezer. Let them freeze completely before stacking them. This can take anywhere from two to four hours depending on your freezer. When you're ready to use the cauliflower, take it out of the freezer and let it thaw in the fridge overnight. If you're in a rush, you can also use the microwave defrost function. Once it's thawed, reheat it using your preferred method such as baking, sauteing or microwaving. Freezing cauliflower is an easy and convenient way to have it at your disposal when you need it. Just remember to portion it into freezer-safe containers, seal them tightly, and label them with the date. With these simple steps, you'll have fresh cauliflower all year round."},{"instruction":"As of the census of 2000, there were 218,590 people, 79,667 households, and 60,387 families residing in the county.

One of the most effective ways to do this is by asking teasing and intriguing questions that pique their curiosity. These could be questions about anything from their favorite childhood memories to their most embarrassing moments – the key is to make them want to know more. Another important technique to use is humor. Showing your sense of humor can help spark their imagination and make you seem more approachable and relatable. Whether it's through witty banter or playful teasing, a well-timed joke can go a long way in keeping someone on your mind. Of course, when it comes to building romantic connections, it's important to be bold and direct. Don't be afraid to send a romantic or straightforward text that lets them know how you feel. Whether it's a simple \\"Thinking of you\\" or a more elaborate declaration of love, expressing your feelings clearly can make all the difference. Finally, it's worth noting that sensory details can be incredibly effective in making someone fantasize about you. By describing the way you look, sound, smell, and feel, you can create a vivid mental image that will stay with them long after you're gone. So don't be shy – embrace your sensuality and use it to your advantage. With a little bit of effort and a lot of confidence, you can make sure that you're always on the mind of the person you're interested in."},{"instruction":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: wide angle view of millions of bright green ferns grow underneath the canopy of a pine fore","output":"important words: wide angle, view, millions, bright green, ferns, grow, underneath, canopy, pine forest."},{"instruction":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Improved image depiction when changing from portrait to landscape form","output":"Improvedimagedepictionwhenchangingfromportraittolandscapeformat."},{"instruction":"University of Notre Dame The library system of the university is divided between the main library and each of the colleges and schools.

Take your child to the doctor.","output":"Tick bites are becoming an increasingly common health concern, especially during the summer months when outdoor activities are at their peak. Not only are tick bites annoying, they can also lead to serious health issues such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and other tick-borne illnesses. Therefore, it is important to take immediate action when a tick is found on your or your child's body. The first step is to understand the increased risk of tick bites. Areas with high vegetation, such as forests, grasslands, and even your own backyard, can be home to ticks. When going outdoors, it is important to wear protective clothing, such as long sleeves and pants, and use insect repellent to avoid tick bites. However, if a tick is found, it is important to take quick action. The next step is to disinfect the area around the tick. It is important to use rubbing alcohol or soap and water to remove the germs that may be present in the bite area. This will help prevent infection if the tick has already bitten. After disinfecting the area, use fine-tipped tweezers to remove the tick. Grab the tick as close to the skin as possible, and pull it slowly and steadily upward without twisting or jerking it. This will help prevent the tick's mouthparts from breaking off and remaining in the skin. Place the tick in a container, such as a small plastic bag or jar. This can help the doctor identify the tick and determine if it carries any diseases. Clean the tick bite area with rubbing alcohol or soap and water again. Watch for any signs of infection, such as redness or swelling, around the bite area. Finally, take your child to the doctor. The doctor will examine your child and may prescribe antibiotics if there is a risk of Lyme disease or other tick-borne illnesses. A blood test may also be performed to check for any presence of tick-borne diseases. In conclusion, tick bites can be a serious health issue and require immediate attention. Understanding the increased risk, disinfecting the area, using fine-tipped tweezers to remove the tick, placing the tick in a container, cleaning the bite area, and taking your child to the doctor are all important steps in preventing tick-borne illnesses. By taking these steps, you can help protect yourself and your family from the dangers of tick bites."},{"instruction":"This is an email I have changed the following deals to reflect a monthly expiry frequency instead of daily: 483753 483759 483765 483766 Since I don't enter options very often, and have only done daily options before, I'm still getting familiar with all the different parameters of the deals.

Simply cut a small piece of tape and stick it near an area where flies congregate. They will stick to the tape and be unable to escape. 2. Clean up dust, dirt, and hair Instead of using a broom or vacuum, use sticky tape to pick up dirt, dust, and hair. Simply wrap a strip of tape around your hand, sticky side out, and run it over the floor, furniture, or wherever the mess may be. The tape will pick up everything in its path. 3. Get rid of other sticky materials Sticky tape can also be used to remove other sticky substances like gum, wax, or adhesive residue. Simply apply the tape to the area and then peel it off, taking the sticky substance with it. 4. Hide small objects If you want to hide small objects like spare keys or jewelry, sticky tape can be your friend. Simply stick the item onto the sticky side of the tape and then place it under a table or other inconspicuous location. It will be there when you need it and hidden from view.
