Marlise Munoz, a 33-year-old mom of a toddler, collapsed at her home in November 2013 due to what is believed to have been a blood clot in her lungs. She was taken to the hospital, where doctors pronounced her brain dead.

But the hospital has insisted that it must follow the applicable state law, which prohibits the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a pregnant patient. This case has sparked a nationwide debate over the rights of pregnant women, who are often not given the same autonomy over their bodies as other patients. Pro-choice advocates argue that a woman's right to choose should not be superseded by the government or hospital policies, regardless of whether she is pregnant or not. The Munoz family has vowed to continue fighting for Marlise's right to a dignified death, and to bring attention to the broader issues surrounding end-of-life decisions for pregnant patients.

In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in smallworld networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method. Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the footandmouth virus in 2001.

However, the angle at which you hold your pen can also have a significant impact on the quality of your writing. Experts recommend holding your pen at a diagonal angle of 30 to 60 degrees. This allows for the smooth flow of ink onto the paper, resulting in clearer and more legible handwriting. Holding your pen too vertically or too horizontally can lead to smudging and smearing, making your writing difficult to read. Proper pen angle also helps to reduce hand fatigue, as it allows for a more natural and relaxed grip. Holding your pen too tightly or gripping it awkwardly can lead to cramping and discomfort, making writing a tiresome task. If you find it difficult to adjust to this recommended pen angle, try practicing with a lighter and more flexible pen. This can help you loosen your grip and allow for a more comfortable writing experience. It may take some time and effort to get used to this technique, but the benefits are well worth it. In conclusion, holding your pen at a diagonal angle of 30 to 60 degrees can greatly improve the quality and legibility of your writing while also reducing hand fatigue.

To say that a given statement (e.g., the statement of a law of some scientific theory) [call it T] is falsifiable does not mean that T is false. Rather, it means that, if T is false, then (in principle), T could be shown to be false, by observation or by experiment. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between verification and falsifiability lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of demarcation between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable.

The harmful effects of addiction can include financial troubles, relationship issues, decreased job performance, depression, and anxiety. But there is hope for those struggling with addiction. One way to take control is to make positive changes in your life. This can be achieved by setting goals, creating a quitting mission statement, and setting timed goals. The first step is to acknowledge the harmful effects of addiction and commit to change. Creating a quitting mission statement can help with this. This statement should be personal and specific, outlining your reasons for quitting and what you hope to achieve. It can be a reminder of your goals and a source of motivation during tough times. Setting timed goals is another powerful tool in combating addiction. These goals should be achievable and focused on the positive changes you want to make. For example, you could aim to exercise for 30 minutes a day or to spend more quality time with loved ones. Positive changes can also include finding new hobbies or activities that promote well-being and provide a healthy outlet for stress. This could be anything from yoga or meditation to painting or hiking. It's important to remember that breaking free from addiction is a journey and not a quick fix.

One baby who has been affected by this condition is Freddie Summersgill, aged six months, from the UK.

These individuals are there to support and encourage us when we need it the most. However, being a good friend is not always easy. It requires effort, honesty, and respect. In this article, we will discuss some essential traits of a good friend and why they are so important. Honesty is the foundation of any healthy relationship, including friendships. A good friend is someone that you can trust, and trust can only be built upon honesty. Being honest means not withholding information, telling the truth, and owning up to our mistakes. If we want our friends to trust us, we must first trust them. Reliability is also crucial in any good friendship. Friends need to know that they can count on each other when they need help or support. Being reliable means being there when our friends need us, not just when it's convenient for us. We must make an effort to be there for our friends and to be someone they can rely on. Respect is another essential trait of a good friend. It means treating our friends the way we want to be treated. We should not talk behind our friend's back or spread rumors or lies. We need to be mindful of what we say and do, as it can have a significant impact on our friends. Being kind to others is also important in any relationship, including friendships. When we are kind, we show our friends that we care. Kindness can be something as simple as a compliment or a small gesture to show our appreciation for them. It can go a long way in making someone's day better. Opening up to our friends is also vital in any good friendship. It means being vulnerable and sharing our feelings and emotions with those we trust. When we open up to our friends, we create a deeper connection and build a stronger bond. It's important to know that we can confide in our friends and that they will be there to support us. In conclusion, being a good friend requires effort, honesty, reliability, respect, kindness, and openness. These traits are essential in any healthy friendship and help build strong bonds that last a lifetime. By being a good friend, we can create a supportive and uplifting community that helps us navigate life's challenges.

Drill holes in the center of the top and bottom of your barrel. Drill holes into the body of the barrel for aeration. Create a door on the side of your barrel. Attach a sheet of metal inside the barrel to act as a mixing fin to help turn the compost when the barrel rotates. Pass the pipe or post through the center holes. Build a wooden saw buck to support the compost barrel. Set the barrel with the pipe in the wooden 2x4 saw buck. Rotate the barrel in the sawhorse frame using the pipe or post as an axle to ensure it works properly.","output":"Construct a Tumbling Composter with a Barrel Roll Design Composting is an economical and eco-friendly way to produce top-notch soil that can be used for gardening, landscaping, and potted plants. Among the various composting mechanisms, a tumbling composter is particularly convenient for small backyard gardens as it helps produce compost faster and with minimal effort. This article details the steps to build a “barrel-roll” tumbling composter using a repurposed barrel and some simple materials. Step 1: Gather Materials To begin, gather materials needed to construct a barrel-roll tumbling composter. The key material required is a food-grade barrel with a lid, usually made of plastic with an airtight seal. The other necessary items include a drill for making holes, a sheet of metal to use as a mixing fin, a pipe or post to stabilize the barrel, and wood to build a 2x4 sawhorse frame. Step 2: Drill Holes for Aeration Once you have obtained the materials, drill a few holes into the center of the top and bottom of the barrel. These holes will allow the compost to breathe and release moisture. Next, drill several more holes around the sides of the barrel for aeration purposes. Step 3: Create a Door Make a door on the side of the barrel. Ideally, it should be mid-way between the top and bottom of the barrel to allow for easy access to the compost. Hinges and a latch can be used to close the door and keep the compost in place. Step 4: Attach a Mixing Fin Cut a sheet of metal to match the length of your barrel and attach it inside. It will act as a mixing fin to help turn the compost when the barrel rotates. Step 5: Stabilize the Barrel with a Pipe Pass the pipe or post through the center holes in both ends of the barrel. This will help to stabilize the barrel and ensure that it rotates properly. Step 6: Build a Saw Buck Using wood, construct a sawhorse frame to support the compost barrel. A sawbuck is a wooden stand that allows you to work with logs, and in this case, it will support your barrel. The 2x4s are cut at an angle and length to create a cradle for the barrel. Step 7: Set up the Composter Finally, place the barrel with the pipe in the wooden 2x4 sawhorse frame, and begin rotating the barrel in the sawhorse frame. This motion ensures that the compost is mixed thoroughly and speeds up the composting process. In conclusion, building a “barrel-roll” tumbling composter is an easy project that requires only a few materials and tools. With your homemade composter, you’ll be able to recycle organic waste and create a natural, nutrient-rich soil amendment that will help your garden flourish."},{"instruction":"Forgot my Facebook password and email password.

The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long. As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see Accuracy). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would drift further. Lilius proposed that the 10day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March.

It is important to note that in some cases, a game may end without either team scoring a touchdown, in which case the question would be unanswerable. In conclusion, the question of which player scored the last touchdown of a game requires specific details about the game in question.

Find the coordinates of the line segment’s endpoints.

The process involves setting up the Distance Formula, finding the coordinates of the line segment's endpoints, and plugging those coordinates into the formula. To set up the Distance Formula, we use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that the sum of the squares of the two sides of a right triangle equals the square of the hypotenuse. In a plane, we have two points, which form the endpoints of the line segment. We can imagine that the line segment forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, with the two points forming the other two vertices. To find the coordinates of the line segment's endpoints, we need to know the location of each point in the plane. Each point has two coordinates, which are usually denoted as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Once we know these coordinates, we can determine the length of each side of the right triangle. Finally, we plug the coordinates into the Distance Formula, which is as follows: distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) The square root of the sum of the squares of the difference of the coordinates of the two points gives us the distance between those points. In summary, to calculate the distance between two points in a plane, we must first set up the Distance Formula, find the coordinates of each endpoint of the line segment, and then plug those coordinates into the formula. This fundamental concept is crucial in geometry and has many real-world applications, such as calculating the distances between two cities or finding the shortest distance between two points in a maze."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning?

Manning played in the NFL for many years and threw countless touchdown passes during his career, so without additional information, the question is too general to provide an accurate answer. However, we can look at some examples to illustrate how we might answer this question given more specific information. For example, if we were talking about a specific game like Super Bowl XLVIII, where Manning played for the Denver Broncos against the Seattle Seahawks, we could look up the game statistics and find that Manning did not throw any touchdown passes in the first quarter. In fact, he threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by the Seahawks' defense early in the game, setting the tone for a disappointing performance by the Broncos. On the other hand, if we were talking about a different game where Manning had a more successful first quarter, we would need to look up the game statistics to find the answer. For example, in a game against the Baltimore Ravens in December 2012, Manning threw two touchdown passes in the first quarter alone. This helped the Broncos build an early lead that they maintained throughout the game, eventually winning by a score of 34-17. In summary, to answer the question of how many touchdown passes Manning threw in the first quarter, we need to know which game or games we are talking about. Without that context, the question is too broad to provide a specific answer. Once we know which game we are referring to, we can look up the relevant statistics to find the answer."},{"instruction":"Write a title: TORONTO (CP) Canada Basketball dumped Jay Triano on Tuesday after some six years as men #39;s team head coach and 11 years as a player seven of them as captain.","output":"\\"Canada Basketball Fires Veteran Coach Jay Triano\\""},{"instruction":"Rate the similarity of the following two sentences on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is no meaning overlap and 5 is means the same thing?

It is important to note that the conquest of Roussillon was not without resistance. Many of the locals felt a strong attachment to their Spanish heritage and culture, and opposed the French presence.

Despite this initial resistance, Roussillon has remained a part of France to this day.

It stimulates your immune system to recognize and attack the virus. It is recommended to get the vaccine annually, as the flu virus strains can change from year to year. 2. Wash your hands often: Regularly washing your hands with soap and water can help prevent the spread of germs. 3. Do not share cups or utensils: The flu virus spreads through respiratory droplets. Sharing cups or utensils with someone who has the flu may increase your risk of infection. 4. Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze: Use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. If you don't have a tissue, use your inner elbow. 5. Take vitamin C supplements: Vitamin C helps to boost your immune system, reducing your risk of getting sick. 6. Take an antiviral medication: Antiviral medications can help to reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of the flu. It is important to consult with your healthcare provider for the proper dosage and timing of these medications.

By incorporating games into a lesson plan, educators can make the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable, leading to improved retention of information. Moreover, games offer opportunities for students to develop important life skills, such as teamwork and problem-solving. In addition to games, rewards can be used as incentives to motivate students to engage with their work. Rewards can take many forms, from small treats like stickers or candy, to more significant incentives like field trips or extended breaks. The key is to ensure that the rewards are meaningful enough to encourage students to work hard and achieve their goals. One particularly effective activity to try is a show and tell session. During these sessions, students are encouraged to present a particular item or concept to their classmates. This fosters a sense of community within the classroom and allows students to gain confidence in their presentation skills. Show and tell also provides a unique opportunity for students to share their experiences and knowledge with their peers, leading to a more well-rounded and diverse understanding of the world. In conclusion, when it comes to teaching, it's important to find creative ways to engage your students. By using games, rewards, and show and tell activities, educators can make the learning experience more enjoyable and effective. These strategies are particularly effective for younger students but can be adapted for learners of all ages.

Multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy the same house, unlike families of later dynasties. According to Confucian family norms, various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy. For example, there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered more important than the mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry.","output":"Title: Han-era Family and Marriage Customs"},{"instruction":"What is the title of this article: The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Paying two visits to the archipelago, Bermúdez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock (previously called Spanish Rock). Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia (a term originally applied to all of the North American continent) two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore.","output":"Title: History of Bermuda's Discovery and Settlement"},{"instruction":"There are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that, if executed clearly, could have elevated it from Spaghettiwestern blandness into something special. Unfortunately, A TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies imaginable! Scenes start and end abruptly, characters leave for long stretches, the performances (and accents) of the actors are pretty inconsistent, etc. Robert Shaw is a Mexican(!) revolutionary who, after taking part in wiping out a village, stays on to become a priest(!)...ten years later the village is being run by mayor Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives looking for Shaw. They all yell at each other A LOT and they all shoot each other A LOT. Fernando Rey is in it too (as a blind man). The performances aren't bad, but they are mightily uneven. Savalas has an accent sometimes as does Landau (who is really grating here).

As such, the District Attorney's office has been working tirelessly to investigate the case and bring the manager to justice. Fortunately, some progress has been made in the case. The District Attorney recently announced that the manager has returned about 7 million worth of gold. While this is a significant sum, it is unclear if it will be enough to mitigate the potential consequences of her actions. If convicted, the manager could be facing up to 25 years in prison. This is a substantial sentence and one that should give pause to anyone else considering such criminal activity. Stealing from your employer is never a wise decision, and the consequences of such actions are severe. It is important to remember that when working for someone else, you are entrusted with their property and livelihood. Violating that trust is not only morally wrong, it is also illegal. As such, it is crucial to remain honest and trustworthy, even when no one is watching. In conclusion, the case of the Jacmel Jewelry vault manager serves as a harsh reminder of the consequences of violating trust. While she has admitted to her wrongdoing and returned some of the stolen gold, the potential consequences of her actions remain severe. Hopefully, her case will serve as a warning to anyone else considering such illegal activity."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise The newest addition to the castle precinct is the Chester Beatty Library, which moved here from Ballsbridge ., can we conclude the hypothesis The Chester Beatty Library is the only structure in the castle precinct. is true?

Blatter says he is convinced Qatar is taking the situation very seriously FIFA awarded Qatar the right to host the 2022 World Cup in 2010. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"FIFA President Sepp Blatter spoke out about the \\"unacceptable\\" conditions for migrant workers in Qatar, following a report from Amnesty International. The report highlighted rampant abuse of migrant workers in the country, where they are subject to long hours, low pay, and dangerous working conditions. Blatter stated that he is convinced that Qatar is taking the situation \\"very seriously\\" and is working to address the issue. Qatar was awarded the right to host the 2022 World Cup in 2010. The country has faced criticism over its treatment of migrant workers since then. The Amnesty International report is just the latest in a series of reports highlighting the plight of migrant workers in the country. The report found that migrant workers had been subjected to a wide range of abuses, including being forced to work in extreme heat and being forced to pay high recruitment fees to secure a job in Qatar. Workers were also found to be living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, with little access to medical care. Blatter's comments are likely to fuel ongoing debate about the suitability of Qatar as a host for the World Cup. Many critics have called for the tournament to be moved to a different country, citing both the treatment of migrant workers and concerns about Qatar's restrictive laws and lack of infrastructure. In response to the report, FIFA has called for an urgent meeting with Qatar's football federation to discuss the issue of migrant worker abuse. The organization has also reiterated its commitment to human rights and called on all parties involved in the World Cup preparations to respect the rights of workers. Ultimately, the issue of migrant worker abuse in Qatar is unlikely to go away anytime soon. While Blatter's comments suggest that Qatar is taking the situation seriously, it remains to be seen whether the country will take concrete action to address the issue. Until then, the controversy surrounding the 2022 World Cup is likely to continue."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Al Asad Airbase OPERATING_ORGANISATION United States Air Force; United States Air Force AIRCRAFT_FIGHTER McDonnell Douglas F15 Eagle; United States Air Force BATTLES United States invasion of Panam","output":"The data shows that Al Asad Airbase was operated by the United States Air Force and housed McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft, and was not directly involved in the United States invasion of Panama."},{"instruction":"Briefly summarize this sentence: bambi will not be dining at m. night shyamalan 's estate anytime soon .","output":"Bambi won't eat at M.

The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length.

The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition.

Mubarak was convicted last year but was granted a retrial after appealing his conviction.","output":"Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his sons, along with a former minister and security aides, were due to face retrial for corruption charges. However, the trial has been adjourned until mid-August, leaving many in Egypt wondering what will become of the charges against the former leader. Mubarak was forced from office in February 2011 after two weeks of mass street protests in Cairo and other cities around the country. He was convicted of corruption charges last year but was granted a retrial after appealing his conviction. Since then, he has been living in a military hospital in southern Cairo, where he has been receiving medical treatment. The retrial has been postponed multiple times because of Mubarak's poor health, and the recent adjournment is no exception. Many observers believe that Mubarak, who is now 93 years old, will likely never be brought to justice for his alleged crimes. Despite this, many Egyptians still hope that the retrial will lead to some form of justice for the former leader's actions. The trial is an important reminder of the power of the people to hold their leaders accountable and ensure that they are held responsible for their actions. The Egyptian people have demonstrated time and again that they will not tolerate corruption or abuses of power, and this retrial is just one example of their commitment to democracy and justice. In conclusion, the adjournment of Hosni Mubarak's retrial until mid-August is a setback for those who seek justice for his alleged crimes. However, it also serves as a reminder of the importance of the Egyptian people's determination to hold their leaders accountable for their actions. Despite the challenges, the people of Egypt will continue to fight for their rights and for a future free from corruption and oppression."},{"instruction":"Question: when is the last time iowa state went to a bowl game??
