This is not a new tactic for jihadists, as Peter Bergen points out. For years, militants in the Middle East and South Asia have conducted jailbreaks, resulting in large numbers of individuals being freed and potentially joining their ranks. These events also provide propaganda coups for the militant groups. Bergen suggests that the United States needs to better secure their prisons to prevent such attacks. Making prisons more vulnerable to attacks much more secure is crucial to preventing future jailbreaks. Without more secure measures in place, these attacks will continue to occur, leading to increased recruitment for militant groups and further destabilization in the region. It is imperative that measures be taken to prevent these types of attacks from occurring. The U.S. should work with countries in the region to improve prison security and share best practices for keeping inmates and prison staff safe.

The tuck jump is an impressive move that requires balance, coordination, and a fearless attitude. To get started, you need to master the basics of the tuck jump. At the peak of your jump, pull your knees toward your chest. This is the key to achieving the tuck position. Try to get your knees as close to your chest as possible. This not only looks great, but it also helps you gain more control over your body in the air. If you don't bring your knees up high enough, the tuck jump won't work properly. Once you have pulled your knees toward your chest, grab them with your hands to secure your tuck. This will help you maintain the tuck position throughout your flip. Keep your hands on your knees until you are ready to land. As you flip through the air, be sure to keep your eyes open. This is important for several reasons. First, it helps you stay aware of your surroundings, so you don't accidentally collide with anything. Second, it allows you to see your landing spot. If you keep your eyes closed during the flip, you won't know where to land, and you could end up falling awkwardly. When you see the ground coming up, it's time to prepare for your landing. Release your knees and start to straighten your legs. Extend your arms out to the sides for balance. Aim to land on both feet at the same time. With a practice and persistence, anyone can learn how to do a tuck jump. Remember to pull your knees toward your chest at the peak of your jump, grab your knees with your hands to secure your tuck, and keep your eyes open during your flip so you can see to stick your landing.

Divide the distance by the time to find the speed. Don't forget your units.","output":"Finding the distance an object has traveled and the time it took to cover that distance is a critical aspect of analyzing motion. Once these two parameters are known, the speed of the object can be determined. To calculate the distance traveled, measure the start and end points of the object's motion. This can be achieved using a measuring tape or a ruler. The difference between the two points is the distance traveled. The time taken to cover this distance must then be determined. This can be achieved using a stopwatch or a timer. Start the timing device when the object begins moving and stop it when the object reaches the endpoint. The speed of the object can then be calculated by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took to cover that distance. For example, if the distance traveled is 10 meters and the time taken is 5 seconds, the speed would be 2 meters per second. It's essential to remember to include the units of measurement when expressing the speed. In the example above, the units would be meters per second. In conclusion, finding the distance an object traveled, the time it took to cover that distance, and the subsequent speed is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined above and not forgetting to include units, this process can be easily executed to analyze an object's motion."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Zakaria: Credit crises, financial meltdowns, recessions aren't end of capitalism.

In that regard, both retrospective and prospective costs could be either fixed costs (continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume) or variable costs (dependent on volume). However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as \`\`fixed'' or \`\`variable.'' For example, if a firm sinks 400 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is \`\`sunk'' because it was a onetime expense and cannot be recovered once spent. A \`\`fixed'' cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software. The upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should not be deemed a \`\`fixed'' cost, with its cost spread out over time. Sunk costs should be kept separate.

Pegu, also known as Bago, was a city located in Lower Burma which served as the capital of the Mon kingdom in the 15th century. It was later conquered by the Burmese kingdom of Taungoo in the 16th century. Arakan and Pegu had a complex relationship with each other, often alternating between alliances and competition. At times, Arakan served as a vassal to Pegu, while in other periods, Pegu was subservient to Arakan. Historical records suggest that Arakan served as Pegu's vassal for a period of approximately 28 years, between 1539 and 1567. During this time, the Arakanese kingdom paid tribute to Pegu and provided military support when needed. However, it is important to note that the relationship between the two kingdoms was not always smooth, and there were several instances of conflict and betrayal. Despite the periods of vassalage, Arakan remained an important geopolitical player in the region, maintaining strong relations with other neighboring kingdoms such as Siam (modern-day Thailand) and the Portuguese traders who had established a presence in the Bay of Bengal.

It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan.

The young man had been surfing with two companions, who were fortunately rescued. One of the survivors, a 26-year-old male, was located in the nearby waters. Although beaten up, he was thankfully able to return to shore safely. Sadly, the other companion, a 20-year-old man, was found on rocks with minor injuries. They had survived the rip, but not without injury. Sea conditions can be unpredictable and highly dangerous, causing even the most experienced of surfers to fall victim to rips. These currents do not discriminate, and tragically, it appears that the Irish surfer fell victim to its power. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the young man during this difficult time, and hopefully, they will receive answers and closure soon. It is important for surfers and beachgoers alike to always stay vigilant of the sea conditions, checking the forecasts and assessing the risks before entering the water. Precautionary measures, such as swimming between the flags and always having a companion nearby, can greatly reduce the risk of incidents like this occurring. It is vital that everyone, regardless of their level of experience, take the necessary steps to ensure their safety and that of those around them.

It is a chronic condition that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. While there is no known cure for Crohn's disease, there are various treatment options available that can help manage the symptoms. One treatment option that is gaining popularity is biofeedback therapy. Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic monitoring to help individuals learn to control their bodily functions that are usually involuntary. By monitoring vital signs such as heart rate or muscle tension, biofeedback therapy can help individuals learn to control their responses to stress, anxiety or other emotional triggers that can exacerbate the symptoms of Crohn's disease. Another alternative treatment option for Crohn's disease is acupuncture. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese therapy in which thin needles are inserted into specific points on the body to relieve pain and other symptoms. In recent years, acupuncture has gained some acceptance as it is believed to help stimulate the body's natural healing processes and can help improve the overall health of individuals with Crohn's disease. Homeopathy is another alternative treatment option that some people with Crohn's disease may consider. Homeopathy involves using small amounts of natural substances to trigger the body's natural healing processes. Unlike traditional medicine, homeopathy focuses on treating the underlying cause of the condition rather than just the symptoms. It is important to speak to a medical professional before considering any alternative treatment option for Crohn's disease. Some alternative therapies may not be suitable for everyone and may interact with other medications or treatments.

As a responsible pet owner, you should always keep in mind the different types of vegetables that can be safely consumed by your furry friend. In this article, we will discuss some essential information on how you can properly feed your bunny. Firstly, it is recommended that you select at least three types of vegetables per feeding for your bunny. This will help ensure a good balance of nutrients for your pet. You can choose from a wide range of vegetables including lettuce, spinach, kale, parsley, broccoli, and more. However, it is essential to avoid overfeeding certain vegetables to your bunny as this can lead to digestive issues or diarrhea. Secondly, it is recommended to include at least one vegetable that is high in vitamin A. This vitamin is crucial for your bunny's health as it promotes good vision, skin, and immune function. Some great vitamin A-rich vegetables include carrots, sweet potato, pumpkin, and kale. However, you should not overfeed your bunny with just one type of vegetable as this can cause imbalances in their diet. Lastly, it is recommended to use carrots and fruits as treats for your bunny. While carrots are known for being high in sugar, they are safe when given in moderation. Carrots should only be given as a treat, and not as a regular part of their diet. Additionally, fruits like apples, blueberries, and strawberries can be given as treats in small portions, as they are also high in sugar. In conclusion, feeding your bunny the right vegetables is essential for their health and wellbeing. Remember to select at least three types of vegetables per feeding, includIng one high in vitamin A, and to use carrots and fruits as treats. By following these simple guidelines, you can ensure that your bunny is getting all the nutrients they need to live a healthy and happy life."},{"instruction":"Write a negative movie review.","output":"The movie lacked coherence in its storytelling and failed to engage the audience.

Try underhand or overhand throwing and see which works best for you. When the ball lands in a cup, alternate drinking the beer between you and your partner—if you drink the first cup, let your partner drink the second. Set the cup aside once you drink it. Once 6 cups of beer have been drunk, restack the remaining 4 into a diamond. This will make shooting easier for everyone. Once 8 cups have been drunk, arrange the last 2 into a line. The team who has no cups loses, and the other team has won.","output":"This article explains the rules of the game beer pong: throwing a ball into a cup of the opposing team and drinking the beer in the cups in alternating order."},{"instruction":"mperial submitted a total of 1,257 staff across 14 units of assessment to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) assessment.

The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist).

The pressure comes not only from his poor showing in the recent primaries, but also from other prominent Republicans who fear that continuing the race could harm the party's chances of unseating President Obama in the general election. Some have even openly called for Santorum to drop out of the race. However, Santorum has refused to give up, calling himself the \\"best candidate to defeat Obama\\" and pointing to his strong support among conservative voters. He has also lashed out at Romney, accusing him of being a \\"weak candidate\\" who is out of touch with the concerns of average Americans. Despite his defiance, Santorum faces an uphill battle to win the Republican nomination. With the majority of the primaries already over and Romney holding a substantial delegate lead, Santorum would need a series of major upsets to win the nomination. Many political analysts believe that it is only a matter of time before Santorum drops out of the race and throws his support behind Romney.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Aidan Sheikh-Husseyin, a 23-year-old man, suffered from the effects of E. coli after a holiday in Turkey, which caused severe damage to his kidneys. Two years later, he was diagnosed with kidney failure. Fortunately, his father, Ilkay Husseyin, offered to donate one of his kidneys to his son. The transplant operation was a success and both men are now recovering. Aidan Sheikh-Husseyin's case is yet another example of the dangers of contracting food-borne illnesses while traveling. As many travelers seek out new and exotic foods while on holiday, they may unknowingly expose themselves to bacteria and viruses that can lead to serious health problems. In this case, E. coli caused severe damage to Aidan's kidneys, leading to kidney failure two years later. However, the story also highlights the importance of organ donation and the heroic act of Aidan's father, Ilkay Husseyin. The decision to donate an organ can be difficult and comes with risks, but for many, it can mean the difference between life and death. In this instance, the successful transplant operation has saved Aidan's life and given him a newfound hope for the future. It is essential to stress that even though this story has a happy ending, it should also serve as a reminder to take precautions while traveling and to seek medical attention if symptoms of food poisoning persist. Similarly, organ donors are at risk of complications, and people should always weigh the risks and benefits before making a decision. In conclusion, Aidan Sheikh-Husseyin's story is an example of the potential dangers of food-borne illnesses and the importance of organ donation. While it highlights the lifesaving opportunities available through transplantation, it also draws attention to the need for safe food handling practices and the importance of taking care of our health while traveling."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Adam: Rosie and Thomas, Happy New Year!

Mix your carrier and essential oil. Rub the mixture into your roots and scalp. Comb through your hair again and section it into two parts. Apply the base/carrier oil to the length of your hair.","output":"When it comes to hair care, we may often forget about the benefits of using essential oils. Not only do they provide a natural fragrance, but they also have many therapeutic properties. However, before diving into essential oils, it's essential to prepare both your hair and work area. To start, comb out any knots or tangles in your hair. This will not only make it easier to apply the oil but will also ensure that the oil is distributed evenly throughout your hair. Next, create a mixture of both your carrier oil and essential oil. Carrier oils are typically used to dilute essential oils as they can be very potent on their own. Common carrier oils are coconut oil, jojoba oil, or olive oil. Once you have your mixture, it's time to apply it to your hair. Start by massaging the oil mixture into your roots and scalp. This will help promote healthy hair growth and also nourish the scalp. After massaging, comb through your hair once again to ensure that the mixture is distributed evenly. Lastly, divide your hair into two sections, and begin applying the carrier oil to the length of your hair. This will help to hydrate and rejuvenate your strands, leaving them feeling soft and silky. Once you've applied the oil, let it sit for at least 30 minutes before washing it out. Using essential oils in your hair care routine can provide many benefits, such as promoting healthy hair growth and nourishing the scalp. By taking proper precautions and using carrier oils, you can add this natural therapy to your hair care routine."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: Directly underneath the State Apartments is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semistate apartments.

Said breached his family life as close to family and knew no one in Zambia. Tribunal also told he would 'not be welcome' in Zambia because of record.","output":"Joseph Janbazian Zulu, a 20-year-old, was recently sentenced to four and a half years in prison for his involvement in the arson of council buildings during the 2011 London riots. Despite his imprisonment, he was later sent to his homeland, Zambia, as part of the government's deportation program. However, his appeal to the tribunal succeeded in overturning the decision based on the breach of his family life, as he was close to his family and did not know anyone in Zambia. The tribunal also noted that Zulu's criminal record made him \\"not welcome\\" in Zambia, leading to the decision to allow him to stay in the UK. This case raises an interesting question about the ethics of deportation, specifically when it comes to sending individuals back to their home countries. On one hand, it is important to hold individuals accountable for their actions and ensure that they face the consequences of their crimes. However, deportation policies that do not take into account the impact of such decisions on the individual's personal and emotional lives can be devastating. In Zulu's case, he was faced with the prospect of leaving behind his family and returning to a country where he had no friends or support network. Furthermore, the tribunal's decision to highlight Zulu's criminal record as a reason for not welcoming him back to Zambia raises important questions about the impact of criminalization on individuals' lives. In some cases, individuals may be labeled as criminals due to systemic bias or lack of access to resources and may face additional challenges in navigating their lives and accessing support. Overall, the case of Joseph Janbazian Zulu highlights the need for policymakers to carefully consider the long-term impact of deportation policies on individuals' lives and to develop policies that prioritize rehabilitation and support for those who have committed crimes. Deportation decisions should not be made in a vacuum, and policymakers should take into account the complex social and personal realities that individuals face when making these decisions."},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: AlsonearbyisthepicturesquePlazaLaConcordia,withavarietyofniceterracedrestaurants,shopsandcafes.","output":"Here is the corrected text: \\"Also nearby is the picturesque Plaza La Concordia, with a variety of nice terraced restaurants, shops and cafes.\\""},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: Loan signs are sometimes used for emphasis like the loan sign YES substituted for the sign YES but sometimes represent the only form of the sign eg NO","output":"Loan signs are sometimes used for emphasis like the loan sign \\"YES\\" substituted for the sign \\"YES\\", but sometimes represent the only form of the sign, e.g., \\"NO\\"."},{"instruction":"This is some data: (19255) 1994 VK8, apoapsis, 6603633000.0 (kilometres); (19255) 1994 VK8, averageSpeed, 4.56 (kilometrePerSeconds).

The discovery was made as the lorry was preparing to board a ferry to Newhaven, East Sussex. The group had concealed themselves within the shipment in an attempt to enter the UK undetected. The incident highlights the ongoing issue of people attempting to enter the UK illegally. Despite increased security measures, individuals continue to take dangerous risks in order to make the journey, often placing themselves in incredibly risky situations. The discovery of the group on the lorry also raises concerns about the welfare of those attempting to make the journey. Hiding in a shipment of pine trees is hardly a safe or comfortable way to travel, and those who attempt to do so put themselves at risk of injury or worse. It is important that action is taken to combat this issue and ensure that those who do attempt to enter the UK do so safely and legally. This requires a coordinated effort across borders and between agencies to tackle the root causes of illegal immigration and offer support to those who may be vulnerable to exploitation. As this incident shows, the risks of attempting to enter the UK illegally are significant, both for the individuals involved and for wider society.

How does the story transform into what people would expect from a scifi fiction story? Some good plot heads may include : Riddles, hypotheses, or conclusions. Choose the appropriate writers and significant people to write the science fiction. Have as many characters as possible, and start coming up with some sophisticated scifi ideas about the story. The more characters, the more interesting your story will become. How do you get there? Ask for directions and ideas along the way. Don't be afraid to take those with you. The crazier it sounds, the better your story will be. Mix up your plot with different locations or events, but don't make it too broad, as this will confuse and potentially bore your readers.","output":"What happens next?

Regular upkeep ensures that your device stays functional and prolongs its lifespan. One essential aspect of device maintenance is cleaning. Dust and other particles can accumulate on the screen and around the device, which not only affects its appearance but also its performance. To clean your device, start by turning it off and unplugging it if necessary. This step ensures that you are not exposing your device to any electrical current while cleaning. Moreover, it prevents any damage that may occur if water or cleaning products get on an active device. Once your device is off, let it cool down for a few minutes, especially if you have been using it for an extended period. Dusting a warm device can trap moisture on the screen, resulting in damage or streaks. Allow the device to reach room temperature before cleaning. For a quick clean, dust the screen with a microfiber cloth. Microfiber cloths are ideal for cleaning screens because they are gentle, absorbent, and do not leave streaks. Ensure that the cloth is free of any debris or dirt that may scratch the screen. Besides the screen, your devices may have buttons, ports, and other areas that may accumulate dust or dirt. Use the same microfiber cloth to wipe off the area around the screen and other parts of the device. Be gentle yet thorough to remove all particles. In summary, cleaning your device regularly not only keeps it looking good but also prolongs its lifespan. To clean your device, start by turning it off, allowing it to cool down, and then use a microfiber cloth to dust the screen and other areas.

The term \`\`book'' is a reference to the books used by wagebrokers to track wagers, payouts, and debts. Many legal sportsbooks are found online, operated over the Internet from jurisdictions separate from the clients they serve, usually to get around various gambling laws (such as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 in the United States) in select markets, such as Las Vegas, Nevada, or on gambling cruises through selfserve kiosks.

Prune off wispy branches as well, as they tend to be weak and can easily break off. Additionally, cut off any branches that are rubbing against the main stem.

However, there are some techniques that can make this experience more enjoyable and efficient. One of them is turning your wrist to dip the spoon into the soup or liquid, which will help you scoop more liquid with each spoonful. Furthermore, using the side of the spoon instead of the tip can help you capture more food per scoop, enabling you to enjoy the flavor and texture of your meal in a more significant way. Another important aspect of eating with a spoon is maintaining a gentle and slow pace. Rushing through your meal can lead to discomfort in your throat or stomach, and you may miss out on the rich flavors and aromas of your food. Therefore, take your time to savor each bite, and try to enjoy the experience without being in a hurry. Moreover, it's also crucial to keep a firm grip on your spoon, especially if you're eating a dish with a lot of liquid or with ingredients that may spill easily. You wouldn't want to drop your spoon or spill your meal, right? Therefore, hold your spoon with a firm but comfortable grip, and try not to tilt it too much on your way to your mouth.

One key step in this process is smoothing the edges of each nail with a file. The edges of our nails can often be jagged or uneven, which can lead to breakage and further damage to the nail. By using a file to smooth the edges, you reduce the likelihood of breakage and keep your nails looking their best. Once you've filed the edges of your nails, the next step is to buff them until they're smooth. Buffing is essentially polishing the nail, which helps to create a smooth and shiny surface. It's important to use a gentle touch when buffing the nails, as too much pressure can cause damage and weaken the nail. Finally, it's always a good idea to take care of your hands by massaging in some hand cream. Hand cream helps to moisturize and hydrate the skin, keeping it soft and supple. It's especially important to moisturize after filing and buffing, as these processes can be drying to the skin. In summary, by following these simple steps, you can keep your nails looking healthy and beautiful. Smooth the edges of each nail with a file, buff the nails until they're smooth, and massage hand cream into your hands to keep them moisturized.

The carvedtop or archtop mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flatbacked mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music.

Consider losing weight if you are overweight. Try deep breathing exercises to relax your esophagus.","output":"Acid reflux is a common condition that causes discomfort and pain to millions of people worldwide. Although it can be challenging to manage, there are some simple tips that can help reduce its symptoms. One of the most effective ways to manage acid reflux is by having several small meals throughout the day. This will prevent your stomach from becoming too full, which can trigger acid reflux. Additionally, it is essential to avoid spicy, acidic foods that can irritate your throat and stomach lining. Having food at room temperature is another helpful tip to alleviate acid reflux. Eating hot or cold food can shock your system and aggravate your condition. Therefore, try to keep your meals at room temperature to prevent any unnecessary discomfort. If you are a smoker or alcohol consumer, it is advisable to stop these habits as they can worsen acid reflux symptoms. Smoking and alcohol consumption weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, a muscle that separates the stomach and esophagus, making it easier for stomach acid to flow back up. Elevating your bed 15 to 20 centimeters (5.9 to 7.9 in) can help you sleep better if you suffer from acid reflux. Lying down flat puts pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to flow back up. Raising the head of your bed elevates your head and upper body, reducing the reflux of acid. Wearing tight clothing around your neck or abdominal area can put pressure on your stomach, exacerbating your acid reflux symptoms. It's best to wear loose and comfortable clothing that allows your stomach and diaphragm to expand comfortably. If you are overweight, losing weight is one of the most effective ways to reduce acid reflux symptoms. Excess weight puts pressure on your stomach, increasing the risk of reflux. Finally, deep breathing exercises are an effective way to relax the esophagus and alleviate acid reflux. Taking deep breaths can help reduce stress and anxiety, which are common triggers for acid reflux. In conclusion, acid reflux can be an uncomfortable and painful condition, but it can be managed by adopting a few simple lifestyle changes. Have small meals throughout the day, avoid spicy and acidic food, quit smoking and alcohol, raise your bed, wear loose clothing, lose weight if you're overweight, and try deep breathing exercises to relax your esophagus. By following these tips, you can significantly reduce the symptoms of acid reflux and improve your quality of life."},{"instruction":"@Colmbear yeh im jus going to miss people Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.

This has put her at risk of being left out of the squad for the upcoming Women's World Cup. Solo was banned last week, just two days after she was a passenger in a car driven by her husband, Jerramy Stevens, who was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. The ban will last until February 16, and during this time Solo will not be allowed to train with the team or participate in any games. While Solo has not been charged with any crime, United States Soccer Federation (USSF) President Sunil Gulati said in a statement that \\"the decision was made in light of the conduct\\" that led to Stevens' arrest. Gulati also said that Solo's ongoing personal situation \\"does not comport with the image of our team or of female athletes.\\" Solo, who is widely considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, has been a key part of the United States women's national soccer team for over a decade. She has helped the team win two Olympic gold medals and was the goalkeeper for the 2015 Women's World Cup-winning team. However, her recent off-field issues have raised questions about her future with the team. Some fans and commentators have criticized the USSF for not taking stronger action against Solo, while others have called for her to be given a second chance. At this point, it remains to be seen whether Solo will be included in the squad for the Women's World Cup. The tournament, which will be held in France this summer, is one of the most prestigious events in women's soccer, and the United States is one of the favorites to win. As Solo serves her ban, the team will have to evaluate its options and decide whether to stick with its longtime goalkeeper or make a change. Regardless of the outcome, the controversy surrounding Solo's ban serves as a reminder of the high standards expected of athletes both on and off the field."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: Misrata, Libya (CNN","output":"Sorry, I cannot provide highlights for an article without its text.

The fighters killed four civilians and a soldier, residents and Chadian security sources said.","output":"Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group infamous for its terrorist activities in Nigeria, has recently carried out its first known deadly attack in the neighboring country of Chad. The United Nations agency has confirmed the incident, which claimed the lives of at least four civilians and one soldier. According to sources from within Chadian security forces, the fighters conducted the attack in the Lake Chad region, which borders Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon. The militants struck a village known as Kaiga Kindjiria, situated near the Chadian border with Niger, early on Saturday morning. The news of this deadly raid by Boko Haram will undoubtedly deepen the existing security concerns in the region. The group's violent insurgency in Nigeria, which began over a decade ago, has escalated in recent years and led to over 36,000 fatalities. The group has also carried out attacks in neighboring countries such as Chad, Cameroon, and Niger, which have displaced over 2.5 million people. The Chadian President, Idriss Deby Itno, declared a state of emergency in the region in 2015, and since then, his government has taken steps to counter the threat posed by Boko Haram. Chad, which is a member of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), has deployed thousands of troops to the Lake Chad region to fight the extremists. Despite these efforts, Boko Haram has continued to carry out attacks indiscriminately, targeting civilians and security forces alike. The recent attack in Chad is a reminder that the group remains a significant security threat in the region, and more needs to be done to defeat it. The international community must continue to support the countries affected by Boko Haram and provide them with the necessary resources to combat the group. While military operations and counter-terrorism measures are vital, any long-term solution to the crisis in the region will require addressing the socio-economic factors that have contributed to the group's growth and expanded its influence. In conclusion, Boko Haram's recent deadly attack in Chad highlights the ongoing security challenges posed by the extremist group in the region. It underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to address the crisis, which requires not only military actions but also addressing the underlying factors that have led to the group's growth and attractivity."},{"instruction":"Static electricity is like a teetertotter.

One of the most infamous incidents was the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, in which thousands of French Protestants were killed. In addition to violent attacks, Protestants were also frequently forced to flee from their homes and communities. This often meant leaving behind their possessions and livelihoods, and facing difficult conditions on the road or in refugee camps. It is difficult to determine an exact number of Protestants who died as a result of these forced displacements and the privations that came with them. However, estimates suggest that the total number could be in the hundreds of thousands. For example, during the Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands (1568-1648), many Protestants were driven from their homes by Spanish Catholic forces. Some estimates suggest that up to 100,000 Protestants died as a result of the conflict, either directly or indirectly. Similarly, in England during the reign of Queen Mary I (1553-1558), many Protestants were burned at the stake for their religious beliefs. Others were forced to flee the country to avoid persecution, and some may have died as a result of harsh conditions during their exile. Overall, while the exact number of Protestants who died as a result of persecution and forced displacement during the Protestant Reformation is difficult to determine, it is clear that the number is significant. These tragic events continue to be remembered and commemorated in many Protestant communities to this day."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: foreground, monarch, statue","output":"The monarch statue stood prominently in the foreground."},{"instruction":"Premise: And restructuring taxes should, at least in theory, encourage desirable types of economic behavior such as hard work, saving, and investment.
