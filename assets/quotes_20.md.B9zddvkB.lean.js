Combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning. These two things would lead to the Protestant Reformation.

Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been consistently growing at a rate that is higher than its per capita GDP. According to the latest data available, in 2019-20, Karnataka's GDP grew at a rate of 5.5%, while its per capita GDP increased by 4.8%. This means that the state's GDP grew by 0.7 percentage points more than its per capita income. This trend has been visible over the past few years. In 2018-19, the GDP of Karnataka grew by 10.3%, while the per capita income increased by 9.6%. In 2017-18, the GDP growth rate was 8.5%, while the per capita income increased by 7.6%. This difference between GDP growth and per capita income growth is significant for the state's economic development. It indicates that Karnataka's economy is growing at a faster pace than its population. This can be attributed to the state's focus on industrialization and services sector growth, which have been driving the economy. However, it is important to note that while Karnataka's overall economic growth has been impressive, the benefits have not been evenly distributed. There are still significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and within different social and economic groups. Addressing these disparities will be crucial for the state's long-term sustainable growth. In conclusion, Karnataka's GDP has been growing at a higher rate than its per capita income in recent years. While this is a positive sign for the state's economy, efforts must be made to ensure that the benefits of this growth are shared more equitably."},{"instruction":"fellows of peterhouse were familiar with (and were indeed known to imitate) the slight sideways vibration of the body which betokened amusement and often precluded a mildly ironical or deflationary quip.

These drains are responsible for filtering out food particles and debris, which can clog the system and cause problems with your machine. So, it’s important to empty them out regularly to prevent blockages and other issues. In addition to emptying the dish machine food drains, it’s also important to empty the sink drain. This area can quickly get clogged with food scraps, oil and other debris, which can cause unpleasant smells and even lead to a buildup of bacteria. So, make sure to clear out any waste from the sink drain regularly to keep it functioning properly. Once the draining tasks are done, don’t forget to put away any dishes that may have been left out. This includes plates, cups, and utensils, all of which can clutter your kitchen and make it look messy. So, take a few minutes to organize things and put items back where they belong. Finally, take out the trash to get rid of any waste or leftovers that may be lying around on the counters or floor. This will help to prevent any unwanted odors and keep your kitchen smelling fresh. In conclusion, emptying the dish machine food drains, sink drain, putting away dishes, and throwing out the trash are all simple yet essential tasks that must be done regularly to maintain a clean and healthy kitchen.

After calling for an ambulance, he was left in excruciating pain for three days due to the response he received from the medics who attended him. According to Sharp, he called 999 for an ambulance after falling over, but was shocked to hear the medics tell him that \\"ambulances are for emergencies.\\" Despite his pleas for help, the medics refused to take him to hospital and left him lying on the floor in agony. It wasn't until three days later that Sharp finally managed to get an appointment with his GP, who diagnosed him with a fractured spine. The delay in treatment caused by the medics' decision to disregard Sharp's call for an ambulance had caused him significant pain and suffering. This story highlights the importance of proper medical responses to emergency situations. Ambulances are an essential resource for those in need of urgent medical attention, and it is crucial that they are dispatched promptly when necessary.

It's essential for medical professionals to take every call seriously and provide the appropriate response, especially when it could mean the difference between life and death.

Using virtual tracks left by users of the app, the creators were able to create detailed maps highlighting the preferred routes of runners. One interesting trend that emerged from the data was that runners seem to prefer being near water. In many cities, the most popular routes were found along waterways such as rivers, lakes, or the ocean. This suggests that there is something particularly appealing about exercising in a waterfront environment. There are many possible reasons for this preference. For one, being near water can have a calming effect on the mind and body. The sound of waves lapping at the shore or the sight of a peaceful river can be a soothing backdrop for a run. Additionally, waterfront locations often offer picturesque views, adding an extra element of enjoyment to a workout. Of course, not every city showed the same trend. Some urban environments had popular running routes that were more focused on parks or other green spaces. However, the overall pattern was clear - runners tend to gravitate towards areas with natural beauty and scenery. Overall, the data collected by the Runkeeper app provides an interesting insight into the habits of runners around the world. By using technology to track and analyze patterns, we can gain a better understanding of what drives people to exercise and stay active. And who knows - maybe knowing that waterways are a popular route for runners will inspire more people to hit the pavement and explore their local waterfronts."},{"instruction":"Premise: Rayfield assists us with these contradictions by saying that, by the standards of his time, Chekhov was a judophile.

Recent photos have revealed cats and dogs across the UK getting into the holiday spirit by wreaking havoc on their owners' decorated homes. One common target for playful pets seems to be Christmas trees. The photos show cats attempting to climb up the branches and knock down ornaments, while dogs jump up and grab hold of the lower branches. This can not only result in a tree being toppled over, but also puts the pets at risk of injury from falling objects. Another festive favorite for pets to play with is wrapped presents. While it's heartwarming to watch a pet excitedly tear open a gift, it can also lead to shredded paper and damaged items inside. The photos show both dogs and cats eagerly digging into the presents under the tree. Festive cards are not safe from pets either, with images of pooches ripping up the cards and causing a mess. And it seems like cats absolutely love to hide among the branches of a Christmas tree, waiting to surprise anyone who gets too close. While it can be frustrating to deal with pet-related holiday mishaps, it's important to remember that our furry friends just want to join in on the festive fun. To avoid any major mishaps, it's a good idea to keep pets under supervision when around holiday decorations and to ensure that any breakable items are placed out of reach.

I first saw this film when it came out. I just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it. A lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life. The film is actually a great 80's example of the type of films made then. Keaton is at his best, all the actors actually did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it. The pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80's is too funny. Being from the 80's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again.

In this particular case, it depends on which Charles is being referred to. There were several kings, emperors, and princes named Charles throughout history, and each had a different successor. For instance, King Charles II of England died childless, which led to the succession crisis known as the Glorious Revolution. This event resulted in the elevation of William III and Mary II to the throne of England. When Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, abdicated in 1558, his son Philip II of Spain became the next emperor. Similarly, when Charles III, King of Spain, died in 1788, his son Charles IV became the new king. Therefore, the question of who was named successor instead of Charles depends on the specific historical context and the particular Charles in question. Overall, succession in the monarchies of Europe was a complex matter that often involved negotiations, diplomatic maneuvers, and even wars."},{"instruction":"Tuvalu: The Princess Margaret Hospital on Funafuti is the only hospital in Tuvalu.

Speak about your feelings.","output":"Effective Communication: How to Have an Important Conversation Conversations are a fundamental aspect of human interaction, allowing individuals to exchange ideas, share experiences and build lasting relationships. However, not all conversations are easy to have, especially if they touch on sensitive topics like personal beliefs, values, and feelings. Therefore, it's essential to learn effective communication skills to help manage difficult conversations. In this article, we will look at the steps you can take to have a difficult conversation in a positive and productive manner. Step 1: Decide Why This Conversation Is Important to You Before starting any conversation, it's necessary to understand why it's important to you. Knowing your motives will help you stay focused on the discussion's purpose and help you communicate more effectively. For instance, do you want to repair a relationship, seek apologies, or negotiate a deal? Understanding your objectives will enable you to frame the discussion and develop a plan for the conversation. Step 2: Ask the Person to Have a Conversation To have a productive conversation, you need to engage the other person willingly. The best way to achieve this is by asking them to have a conversation with you. You could do this through a phone call, an email or social media message. Be clear about the purpose of the conversation and open to scheduling a specific time and place that's comfortable for both of you. Step 3: Remember Who You're Talking to During a conversation, it's essential to remember that you're talking to someone with feelings, emotions, and thoughts. Be respectful in your approach and avoid criticizing or blaming them for what they may or may not have done. Instead, focus on sharing your feelings and thoughts about the issue, without raising your voice or getting defensive. Step 4: Prevent a Second Offense Hurtful words can stick around for a while, and it's essential to avoid making them the center of the conversation. Avoid using language that is judgmental, accusatory, or condescending. Instead, focus on the current issue and discuss ways to prevent it from happening again. Step 5: Speak About Your Feelings The most effective way to have a challenging conversation is to start by sharing how you feel about the situation. This creates a safe space for both parties to communicate their thoughts and emotions effectively. Stick to your feelings, and use \\"I\\" statements to avoid appearing as if you're blaming the other person. For instance, if you're upset because the other party showed up late, you could say, \\"I feel frustrated when you show up late for our meetings.\\" To conclude, having a conversation is an essential part of human interaction. It's crucial to have the tools to manage difficult conversations effectively. The steps outlined above will help you have a productive and positive conversation that promotes healthy communication and relationships."},{"instruction":"Please add spaces between words: Youcannowchoosebetween3Gand4Gandpicknetworksmanually.","output":"You can now choose between 3G and 4G and pick networks manually."},{"instruction":"Feuding neighbours brawled with each other in street in conservatory row.

According to court records, both families attacked each other with a range of household items, including vacuum cleaner parts and rolling pins. Witnesses reported seeing a mother-of-four hunched over a man, hitting him with a part of a vacuum. The fracas even caused a dual carriageway to be brought to a halt, as the families fought on the road. The situation continued to escalate as the feud went on, with a grandmother reportedly running in and out of her house, gathering weapons to use against the other family. The dispute finally came to a head when police arrived on the scene and eight members of the two families were arrested and charged with affray and public order offenses. This kind of violent behavior is not only dangerous and harmful to those involved, but it also puts innocent bystanders at risk. The police have rightly condemned this behavior and have urged people to find peaceful ways to resolve disputes. It's important to remember that violence is never the answer, and that there are always better ways to deal with disagreements. As a community, we need to take steps to ensure that everyone feels safe and secure in their homes. When disputes arise, we should endeavor to find peaceful resolutions through communication and compromise. By working together, we can avoid situations like this and build a safer, happier community for all."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Firstly, pay attention to the size of the bees - Africanized honey bees are typically smaller than their European counterparts. Additionally, AHB are known for being more aggressive, so observe any differences in behavior between the bees you suspect may be Africanized versus those that are not. Another thing to take note of is how long it takes the bees to calm down after being agitated. Africanized honey bees tend to take longer to calm down than European honey bees, so this can be a telltale sign that you are dealing with AHB. When observing the bees, keep an eye out for those that forage for pollen in small groups or alone. This is a behavior that is more commonly associated with Africanized honey bees, which tend to be more independent than their European counterparts. You should also be aware of the different swarm patterns that Africanized honey bees tend to exhibit. While European honey bees tend to swarm in large clusters, Africanized bees may break off into multiple smaller swarms. If you want to be absolutely certain that the bees you are dealing with are Africanized honey bees, the most accurate method is to use DNA testing. This can provide conclusive evidence and help you take any necessary precautions to protect yourself and others from potential danger."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an arrow of time, and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modeled by a parameter in the system being analyzed, where there is no proper time: the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone). In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above.

This record stood for over four decades until it was tied by Jason Elam of the Denver Broncos in 1998 and then later broken by Matt Prater of the Broncos in 2013 with a 64-yard field goal. Dempsey's kick was remarkable not only for its length but also for the fact that Dempsey was born without fingers on his right hand and toes on his right foot. He wore a special shoe that allowed him to kick with greater accuracy and distance. The shoe had a flat front and a widened sole that was made out of leather and rubber. This gave Dempsey greater balance and stability when he kicked. Dempsey's record-breaking achievement is still remembered fondly by Saints fans and football enthusiasts alike.

Salt the hide in order to dehydrate and preserve it. Pack the hide and hang it in a cool, dry place for about 5 days.","output":"Hunting can be a thrilling and rewarding experience, but it is important to prioritize safety and ensure that you hunt ethically. One popular hunting option is to position yourself in a tree stand, which provides a clear view of the surrounding area and minimizes the chances of being detected by animals. When it comes to hunting bears, it is crucial to take a shot that will be both effective and humane. The optimal shot placement is immediately behind the front shoulder, where vital organs can be targeted. Make sure to carefully aim, as a misplaced shot can result in the bear suffering needlessly. For hunters who wish to take a trophy, it is possible to skin the bear and preserve the hide. First, remove any features from the bear's head and face that you wish to keep as a trophy. Next, carefully skin the bear, being mindful of any bones or other obstacles that may require additional care. Once the hide has been removed, it's time to preserve it by salting it. This process involves laying the hide flat and covering it with a generous amount of salt to remove excess moisture and help prevent decay. The salt will need to be changed after a few days to ensure the hide is fully dehydrated. After salting, find a cool, dry place to hang the hide for approximately 5 days. This provides ample time for the hide to dry and the salt to work its magic. Once the hide is completely dry, it will be ready for use or display. In conclusion, hunting can be a wonderful experience, but it is important to prioritize safety and ethics. By positioning yourself in a tree stand and taking careful aim, you can ensure a humane and effective shot. For those wishing to take a trophy, taking the time to properly skin and preserve the bear hide will provide a lasting memento of a successful hunt."},{"instruction":"The city is also the home of road bowling, which is played in the northside and southwest suburbs.

However, they actually refer to different units of people. A household is defined as all the people who occupy a housing unit, regardless of their relationship to one another. This includes single individuals living alone, roommates, and families living together. A family, on the other hand, refers to a group of two or more people who live together and are related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Given these definitions, it is possible for a household to contain multiple families (such as a multi-generational household), or for a family to span multiple households (such as children who split their time between divorced parents' homes). In terms of how many more households there are than families, it is difficult to give a precise answer without more context. It depends on the specific population being studied and the definitions being used. However, in general, it is likely that there are more households than families. This is because households can include individuals or groups of people who are not related to one another, while families are a more specific subset of households. Additionally, there are factors such as divorce, remarriage, and cohabitation that can result in multiple households being created from a single family. Overall, the relationship between households and families is complex and varies depending on the specific situation. However, it is clear that households represent a broader category than families and are therefore likely to outnumber them in many cases."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Bakewell pudding SERVING_TEMPERATURE Warm (freshly baked) or cold; Bakewell pudding SERVED Warm or cold.

These colorful kits of rubber bands, plastic hooks, and instructions on how to make various bracelets, charms, and other accessories have become a global phenomenon since their invention in 2011 by an American dad named Cheong Choon Ng. According to the Rainbow Loom company, over 8 million looms have been sold worldwide, and millions of children and adults have joined online communities and YouTube channels to share their creations, trade patterns, and show off their skills. However, not everyone is thrilled about the looming craze. Some parents, teachers, and therapists warn that the time and focus that some children devote to looming can become obsessive and interfere with other activities, such as homework, exercise, socializing, or sleeping. They point out that looming requires a lot of manual dexterity, fine motor skills, and concentration, which can be challenging for some kids who struggle with attention, coordination, or anxiety. They also note that the rubber bands, although generally safe, can pose choking hazards or allergic reactions, especially if swallowed or used as hair ties. Furthermore, some experts suggest that looming may promote a narrow and gender-stereotypical view of creativity, as most of the designs available in the official Rainbow Loom kits or tutorials tend to be colorful and cute, but not very diverse or innovative. They argue that children should be encouraged to explore different forms of art and expression, such as drawing, painting, music, writing, or performing, that can broaden their horizons and foster their self-confidence and empathy. On the other hand, many fans and defenders of looming argue that it is a harmless and fun activity that can teach children valuable skills, such as patience, persistence, problem-solving, and sharing. They also point out that looming can be a way for children to express their own styles and interests, by adapting the designs to their favorite colors, patterns, or themes. Moreover, they argue that looming can be a social and educational experience, as children can bond with their peers, siblings, or parents over a common hobby, and learn from each other's mistakes and successes. So, what should parents do about the looming craze? Like with any toy or game, they should balance the benefits and risks, and supervise their children's use of it. They should also encourage their children to set limits on their looming time, and to try different activities that can enhance their overall development. Ultimately, they should respect their children's choices and passions, and not judge or pressure them based on gender, age, or skill level. In conclusion, Rainbow Looms are everywhere, and they can be both loved and loathed by different people for different reasons. The important thing is to recognize that each child is unique, and may have different needs and preferences when it comes to play and creativity. The challenge for adults is to provide children with a safe and stimulating environment that allows them to grow and explore in their own ways."},{"instruction":"The East–West Shrine Game is an annual postseason college football allstar game played each January since 1925.

The Football League boss Shaun Harvey, speaking to the media, has highlighted the fact that Cellino's appeal against the conviction is hanging over the club like a cloud. The uncertainty surrounding the legal situation of the owner is putting immense pressure on the club and its fans. Cellino has been a controversial figure ever since he took over the club.

Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter is real, though transitory and imperfect, and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul. Plato was therefore a metaphysical and epistemological dualist, an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid: Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense, although quantum physics' assertion that man's consciousness is an immutable and primary requisite for not merely perceiving but shaping matter, and thus his reality, would give more credence to Plato's dualist position.[citation needed] Who regarded Plato as the oldest exponent of metaphysical objective idealism?

In particular, they were eager to gain access to the Portuguese-controlled ports and trading posts in the region. The Dutch were especially interested in the Portuguese holdings in the East Indies, which included present-day Indonesia, Malaysia, and East Timor. One of the primary reasons the Dutch sought to challenge Portuguese dominance in the East Indies was economic. The Portuguese had established a highly profitable trade in spices such as pepper, cloves, and nutmeg, and the Dutch believed they could better monopolize and profit from that trade. Additionally, the Dutch recognized the strategic importance of the East Indies, which lay at the crossroads of trading routes between Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Beyond economic and strategic concerns, the Dutch were also motivated by a desire to assert their political and military power in the region. Portugal had long been a colonial power in Asia, and the Dutch saw an opportunity to challenge their dominance and establish their own empire. As the Dutch gained power and influence, they often engaged in violent conflicts with the Portuguese and other European powers in the region. Ultimately, the Dutch succeeded in displacing the Portuguese and establishing their own colonial empire in the East Indies. They gained control of the spice trade, built impressive cities and fortifications, and established a powerful military presence.

Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask? Gravitational potential energy has the ability to cause motion.

Justice Mostyn, who presided over the case, pointed out that the woman had 'seriously breached her duty of candour.' The couple, who were married in France in 1986, had been leading a life of luxury with all the trappings of vast wealth. However, both parties had extramarital relationships and, by 2010, had become estranged. The husband had threatened to 'disappear' and leave his wife with nothing in the divorce settlement. As a result of this, the wife had opened the safe, which belonged to the husband, in order to gather evidence of their wealth. Despite her intentions, Justice Mostyn declared that the act of opening the safe without the owner's permission was illegitimate, and therefore the evidence gathered could not be admissible in court. This case serves as a reminder to spouses going through a divorce that there are legal and ethical boundaries that must not be crossed, even in the pursuit of what may seem like justice. The duty of candour requires divorcing parties to provide honest and comprehensive disclosure of their assets, and any attempt to circumvent this duty risks serious consequences. In conclusion, it is important to approach divorce proceedings with a clear understanding of the legal and ethical boundaries that must be respected.

After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.a[›] To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, betterunderstandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely (its group representations), both from a theoretical and a computational point of view. A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups announced in 1983.aa[›] Since the mid1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become a particularly active area in group theory.

The city could be argued to have some of the first preconceived layouts in the country. Upon founding, New Haven was laid out in a grid plan of nine square blocks; the central square was left open, in the tradition of many New England towns, as the city green (a commons area). The city also instituted the first public tree planting program in America. As in other cities, many of the elms that gave New Haven the nickname Elm City perished in the mid20th century due to Dutch Elm disease, although many have since been replanted. The New Haven Green is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city. The Green remains the social center of the city today. It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its experience. He used the term experience very broadly, so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience. In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental. Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as philosophy of organism, but it would become known more widely as process philosophy.

The stands were packed with enthusiastic fans, eager to see their favorite players duke it out on the field. The first quarter was evenly matched, with both teams trading touchdowns and field goals. But then, after the two-minute warning of the first half, everything changed. One team, with a series of well-executed plays, managed to stretch their lead to what seemed like an insurmountable margin. The other team, caught off guard and struggling to mount a comeback, was left wondering what had happened. The stunning turn of events can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, the team that pulled ahead was simply more focused and determined. They had prepared extensively for this game and were executing their game plan flawlessly. They were capitalizing on every opportunity and refusing to let up. Secondly, the other team may have underestimated their opponent. They had become complacent after a strong start and failed to adapt to the changing circumstances. They were unable to match their opponent's intensity and began to make sloppy mistakes. Finally, luck may have played a role. Sports are always unpredictable and sometimes the bounce of the ball or a missed call can swing the momentum in one team's favor. Whatever the reason, the game took a stunning turn after the two-minute warning of the first half. The team that had been trailing suddenly found themselves with a daunting deficit to overcome. But while they may have been down, they were far from out. They regrouped during halftime and came out with renewed focus and energy. In the end, it was a hard-fought game that came down to the wire. But the lesson to be learned is that in sports, just as in life, things can change in an instant.

Between 1998 and 2004 IQ declined by about the same amount as it gained between 1989 and 1998.

This platform can provide valuable information about a person's professional experience and connections. You may even find a way to contact them through their LinkedIn profile. If you have a mutual acquaintance with the person you are trying to find, it's worth reaching out to them for assistance. They may be able to provide additional information that can help you locate the individual. Finally, if all else fails, try meeting the person in a neutral location. This could be a public area like a park, coffee shop, or library. However, it's important to be cautious and ensure your safety, especially if you do not know the person well.

According to May, we are headed towards a future where the public will create the show. This idea may seem far-fetched, but May argues that it's already happening in some ways. With the rise of social media, audiences are increasingly shaping the content that they consume. They are able to share their thoughts and opinions online, and these conversations can influence what gets made. May believes that this trend will continue to grow in the coming years.

This could include everything from choosing the storyline to casting the actors. Of course, there are some potential drawbacks to this model. May acknowledges that privacy could be a thing of the past because of social media. As we share more about ourselves online, it becomes easier for companies and governments to monitor our behavior. This could lead to a loss of personal freedom and autonomy. Despite these concerns, May remains optimistic about the future of television.

A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been booked, the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of unsporting behaviour may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Nonplayers such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable.

The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as mushairas (poetic symposia).

Lazzat Un Nisa, a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts. The reign of the Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education.

Identify polycarbonate products. Discard older plastic products.","output":"Plastic products have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, and while they certainly bring convenience, their impact on the environment cannot be overstated. To limit the potential harm caused by these products, it is important to examine their labeling to make informed decisions. The first step is to look for recycling codes, which indicate the type of plastic a product is made of. One type to keep an eye out for is polycarbonate, which is used in many food containers and baby bottles. Polycarbonate plastics are known to leach an endocrine-disrupting chemical called bisphenol-A (BPA) when heated or exposed to acidic environments. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid polycarbonate products, particularly when it comes to storing or cooking food. Instead, opt for containers made of safer materials like glass or stainless steel. Even when purchasing plastic products labeled as \\"BPA-free,\\" make sure they do not contain BPS, another chemical that has similar effects to BPA. In addition to checking for polycarbonate plastics, it is also important to discard older plastic products. Over time, plastic degrades and can release harmful chemicals into the environment. If a plastic product is showing signs of wear and tear, such as cracking or discoloration, it is best to dispose of it and replace it with a new one. By taking these steps, we can reduce our exposure to harmful plastics and help protect our health and the environment. Always remember to examine plastic products for labeling, identify polycarbonate products, and discard older plastic products."},{"instruction":"Question: In 2008 Great Leighs became the first new venue for which sport for 80 years?
