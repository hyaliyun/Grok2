As such, many of the early Digimon—including Tyrannomon, the first one ever created—were based on dinosaurs. Many further designs were created by Kenji Watanabe, who was brought in to help with the XAntibody creatures and art for the Digimon collectible card game. Watanabe was one influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and cool.

They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake. Question: When does deposition occur?

William of Ockham introduced the principle of parsimony: natural philosophers should not postulate unnecessary entities, so that motion is not a distinct thing but is only the moving object and an intermediary sensible species is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye. Scholars such as Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of inertia. The Oxford Calculators began to mathematically analyze the kinematics of motion, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion.

The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing largescale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using selfreplicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of selfreplication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.

This team has developed what is called a robo-muscle, made of a special material called vanadium dioxide. This unique material has the ability to change its size, shape, and structure when exposed to heat, making it incredibly versatile and valuable for various applications. Vanadium dioxide has a very interesting property that makes it stand out from other materials: it acts as an insulator at low temperatures but becomes a conductor at 67 degrees Celsius. This property has long been known, but it was only recently discovered that it can produce a useful mechanical effect when the material contracts and expands. This makes vanadium dioxide an ideal material for creating a robo-muscle, which can mimic the movement of natural muscles and be controlled by heating and cooling. The implications of this breakthrough are significant. This discovery opens up new possibilities for more efficient electronic and optical devices. For example, vanadium dioxide could be used to create faster and more energy-efficient computer chips that can change states rapidly without the need for additional power. Additionally, it could be used to create smart windows that can transition from transparent to opaque with the flick of a switch. Overall, the development of vanadium dioxide robo-muscles by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory team is an exciting advancement in the field of materials science.

Conversely, if the opposing team held them to a short field goal, it means they were able to prevent a touchdown and limit the damage. In the NFL, the current record for the shortest field goal in a game is 6 yards. This record was set on December 21, 1980, by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Neil O'Donoghue in a game against the Miami Dolphins. The Buccaneers had driven down the field and stalled near the goal post, so O'Donoghue kicked the ball through the uprights for the shortest field goal in NFL history. However, it's important to note that this record is for regular-season games only. In the playoffs, the record for the shortest field goal is 9 yards, which has been accomplished twice. First by Don Cockroft in 1981 for the Cleveland Browns against the Oakland Raiders, and then by Ryan Longwell in 2004 for the Green Bay Packers against the Minnesota Vikings. Overall, the shortest field goal in a game may seem like a minor statistic, but it can often be a crucial moment in determining the outcome of a game. It represents a small victory, but also a missed opportunity for a touchdown, and can make all the difference in a close game."},{"instruction":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"Negative."},{"instruction":"w would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? eh im bored.... theres nothing to do when its raining OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"Negative."},{"instruction":"edical authorities removed and stockpiled organs from hundreds of people during autopsies without consent of their relatives , according to a government report .

The movement of String Quartet in G, Opus 18, No. 2 was performed for the first time in 200 years—perhaps the first time ever—at Manchester University, the Telegraph reports.

Two of the most exciting moments occurred when each team scored a touchdown. The Vikings scored a touchdown with a long pass down the field, while the Lions also utilized an impressive pass to get the ball into the end zone. Many fans are now wondering just how long the Vikings' touchdown pass was compared to the Lions' touchdown pass. After reviewing the game footage, it was determined that the Vikings' touchdown pass was 30 yards longer than the Lions' touchdown pass.

With groups of vehicles able to run much closer together than with human drivers, traditional rules on tailgating may need to be removed entirely to prevent unnecessary traffic jams. While tailgating is typically seen as a dangerous behavior to be avoided, the on-board sensors used by autonomous vehicles can act with far more precision than a human driver. This means that it may actually be safer and more efficient for driverless cars to travel in tightly packed formations. However, as with any major shift in technology, there are likely to be growing pains as the infrastructure and regulations catch up. The re-writing of the Highway Code is just one step in this process, but an important one in ensuring that autonomous vehicles are able to operate effectively and safely on our roads. As we move towards a future where human drivers become the minority on our roads, it is vital that we have a set of guidelines in place that can accommodate the unique capabilities of autonomous vehicles.

They were forced to move slowly and carefully, taking in every detail of their surroundings as they went. As they retraced Thesiger's route, the adventurers encountered many changes that had taken place since his time. The area has been transformed beyond recognition in many parts, with new developments and industries springing up where once there was only sand. But despite these changes, they were struck by the beauty and harshness of the desert, and by the resilience of the people who call it home. Tracing the exploits of Wilfried Thesiger is an inspiring and humbling experience. He showed that even in the most inhospitable environments, humans can find a way to survive and thrive. His legacy lives on in the courage and determination of those who seek to follow in his footsteps, and in the enduring fascination of the Empty Quarter."},{"instruction":"Math problem: Solve 26*n 222 = 11*n for n.

One of the key facts about this battle is that 64 defenders were beheaded by the Ottoman forces led by Sultan Murad II. However, there is no clear indication of how many of these 64 defenders were beheaded on May 27th specifically. The sources available regarding the battle do not provide a detailed account of the events, nor do they offer a breakdown of the casualties. What we do know is that the defenders of Sfetnic were vastly outnumbered by the Ottoman army, which is estimated to have had between 40,000 and 100,000 soldiers. The defenders were led by the voivode Vlad II Dracul, whose son Vlad III (also known as Vlad the Impaler) would later become famous for his brutal tactics in battles against the Ottoman Empire. Despite being outnumbered and outmatched, the defenders of Sfetnic held out against the Ottoman forces for several weeks. Eventually, however, they were overcome, and many of them were put to death. The 64 defenders who were beheaded on May 27th have been celebrated as martyrs and heroes in Romanian folklore and history.

However, it is important to prioritize your physical health and consult with your doctor before beginning any new fitness regimen. Your doctor can provide you with guidance on the types of exercises that are appropriate for your body and can help you avoid further complications. Once you have the green light from your doctor, it is crucial to start slow and ease into your exercise routine. Over-exerting yourself can lead to injury, setbacks, and feelings of discouragement. It is important to listen to your body and make modifications if you experience any pain or discomfort during a particular activity. Low-impact aerobic exercises can be an excellent starting point for those who are new to exercising or have experienced previous injuries. These types of exercises minimize the impact on your joints while still providing a great cardiovascular workout. Examples of low-impact exercises include walking, cycling, and using an elliptical machine. If you are looking for a low-impact exercise that also focuses on mindfulness, consider trying yoga. Yoga can help improve strength, flexibility, and balance while also promoting relaxation and mental clarity. When you are ready to incorporate strengthening exercises into your routine, start with simple bodyweight exercises such as squats, lunges, and push-ups. Gradually increase your resistance and intensity as your body adapts and becomes stronger. Finally, if you experience pain during other activities, consider trying swimming as a form of exercise. Swimming is a low-impact activity that can help improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and endurance while minimizing the risk of injury. In summary, starting a new exercise routine can be daunting, but it is important to prioritize your physical health and consult with your doctor before beginning.

The Argentinian striker was in scintillating form as he led City to a comprehensive victory. Among his four goals, Aguero scored twice from the penalty spot but missed one as well in what turned out to be an unforgettable day for the Manchester City striker. Despite the missed penalty, Aguero's goals were enough for his team to comfortably win the game and earn three valuable points.

This is due to various factors such as aging populations, increased life expectancies, and declining birth rates. According to recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, households with someone over 65 accounted for 29.9% of all households in 2020. The average size of these households was 2.17 persons. On the other hand, households with one or more children under 18 accounted for 19.5% of all households and had an average size of 3.19 persons. The smaller size of households with someone over 65 can be attributed to various factors. For instance, as people age, their children usually move out of their homes and start their own families. Additionally, older adults are more likely to live alone or with a spouse, resulting in smaller household sizes. Moreover, advances in healthcare and improvements in quality of life have led to increased life expectancies, and this has greatly contributed to the rise in the aging population. In contrast, households with one or more children under 18 tend to have a larger size due to the presence of minors. Families with young children are also more likely to have extended family members living with them, such as grandparents or aunts and uncles, who contribute to the household size. In conclusion, households with someone over 65 were generally smaller than households with one or more children under 18. While the reasons for this difference in size are complex, factors such as aging populations, increased life expectancies, and declining birth rates all play a role."},{"instruction":"Who wrote the lyrics to the songs in The Sound Of Music?

Brown not only paid off his debts but also purchased a second-hand Jaguar for £4,000 and set aside £2,000 to cover his legal fees in his upcoming divorce from Rachel. Unfortunately, the happiness was short-lived for Mr Brown as soon after the episode of Deal Or No Deal aired on television, his wife Rachel took him to court.

Because the operating system was designed largely around the GUI, existing textmode and commanddriven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten.

The Confederates had the advantage of defending a very large country in an area where disease caused twice as many deaths as combat.

Its eastern armies fought well, but the western armies were defeated one after another until the Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 along with the Tennessee River. In the famous Vicksburg Campaign of 1862–63, Ulysses Grant seized the Mississippi River and cut off the Southwest. Grant took command of Union forces in 1864 and after a series of battles with very heavy casualties, he had Lee under siege in Richmond as William T.

However, what sets us apart is how we respond to these experiences and how we use them to shape our future. In particular, it is essential to approach our mistakes as opportunities for growth and to pass down valuable life lessons to future generations. One critical value that we should uphold is keeping our word. Following through on commitments not only builds trust and respect but also teaches responsibility and accountability. By demonstrating this value to younger relatives, we can inspire them to adopt it as a core principle in their lives. Another crucial aspect is instilling core values such as kindness, honesty, and respect. These fundamental principles will help shape the character and integrity of future generations. As role models, it is our responsibility to lead by example and live out these values in our daily lives. While it is crucial to teach younger relatives to aim for success, it is equally important to teach them to accept and learn from failures. Mistakes provide us with valuable opportunities for growth and development. Instead of dwelling on past failures, we should use them as stepping stones to learn and improve ourselves. Furthermore, we can also use our past mistakes as life lessons for younger relatives. Sharing personal experiences, and the lessons learned from them helps younger generations to understand the importance of accountability and taking responsibility for one's actions. In conclusion, we can make a positive impact on future generations by keeping our word, instilling core values, treating mistakes as opportunities for growth, and using our past failings as life lessons. As we strive to create a better future for ourselves and our families, let us remember that our actions today will shape the future leaders of tomorrow."},{"instruction":"Write a plausible story that ends with this sentence?

While we may not be able to control everything happening in the world, there are steps we can take to protect our loved ones. Here are some tips to help keep your kids healthy during this challenging time. First and foremost, it's critical to remind your kids to wash their hands frequently. Teach them to lather up with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, making sure to get in between their fingers and under their nails. Encourage them to sing a favorite song while doing so to make it more fun. By washing their hands regularly, they will reduce the chance of getting sick and spreading germs. It's also important to teach your children the correct way to sneeze and cough. Encourage them to cover their mouths and noses with a tissue or the inside of their elbow rather than their hands. This can help prevent the spread of germs and protect those around them from getting sick. Another tip is to encourage your children to stop touching their faces. Many people touch their faces without even realizing it, but this can be a quick way for germs to spread. Teach them to avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth unless they've recently washed their hands. Additionally, wiping down common household surfaces each day can go a long way in preventing the spread of germs. Use a disinfectant spray or wipes to clean areas such as doorknobs, light switches, and countertops. By doing so, you'll reduce the likelihood of viruses and bacteria lingering on surfaces your family uses frequently. Finally, answer your kids’ questions about COVID-19 calmly and rationally. It's natural for children to feel anxious and uncertain during these times, and it's important to be honest with them while remaining calm. Provide age-appropriate information and encourage them to ask questions when they're feeling unsure. There's no doubt that these are challenging times, but by taking proactive steps to protect our families, we can help keep everyone healthy and safe. Remind your kids to wash their hands frequently, teach them the correct way to sneeze and cough, encourage them to stop touching their faces, wipe down common household surfaces each day, and answer their questions calmly and rationally.

She says they help restore America's role at the vanguard of personal freedom. Ghitis: Many countries still harshly publish homosexuality. She says U.S. has strayed from its role at times but it's appropriate to return to it.","output":"Frida Ghitis, a renowned journalist and political analyst, believes that the Supreme Court rulings on gay rights in the United States resonate around the world. According to her, these rulings not only help restore America's role as a defender of personal freedom but also send a powerful message to other countries that still harshly punish homosexuality. Despite the gradual progress in some parts of the world, there are still many countries where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by imprisonment, flogging, or even death. This is a clear violation of human rights and an affront to personal freedom. Ghitis argues that the United States, as a country that has long been a champion of human rights, has a moral obligation to speak out against such injustices and take concrete steps to remedy them. Ghitis acknowledges that the United States has strayed from its role as a defender of personal freedom at times, but she believes that it is appropriate to return to it. The recent Supreme Court rulings on gay marriage and other related issues are an example of America's renewed commitment to human rights and personal freedom. These rulings not only have a positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans but also send a powerful message to other countries that are struggling to eradicate discrimination and ensure equality for all. In conclusion, Frida Ghitis is of the view that the Supreme Court rulings on gay rights in the United States have a profound impact not only at home but also around the world. She believes that these rulings help restore America's role in the global fight for personal freedom and send a clear message to countries that still punish homosexuality. By speaking out against such injustices and taking concrete steps to remedy them, the United States can once again become a vanguard of human rights and a beacon of hope for millions around the world."},{"instruction":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Waterman, food = English, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low, area = city centre, familyFriendly = ye","output":"The Waterman is an English restaurant located in the city centre with a family-friendly atmosphere, low customer rating, and affordable price range of less than £20."},{"instruction":"ethatyoucouldn'tgettheAstonMartinDBSin”CasinoRoyale”(2006)torolloverbecausethetyregripwastoogood?

Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this oneandonly deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse. Please answer a question about this article.

However, some of them have developed strategies for coping that can be helpful for the general public. One way that celebrities deal with pain is by staying hydrated. Drinking plenty of water can help to reduce the discomfort associated with a hangover or other types of pain. Celebrities may also opt for natural remedies like ginger tea, which can soothe an upset stomach or headache. Another strategy that celebrities use is staying active. Exercise releases endorphins, which can help to boost mood and reduce pain. Whether it's a morning yoga session or a brisk walk, getting moving on New Year's Day can be helpful for both physical and mental well-being. In addition, many celebrities prioritize self-care on New Year's Day. This could mean taking a relaxing bath, getting a massage, or simply taking some time to unwind and reflect on the past year. Prioritizing self-care can help to reduce stress and promote healing. Finally, celebrities may seek professional help if they are struggling with pain. This could mean going to see a doctor for treatment, or reaching out to a mental health professional if they are experiencing emotional pain. Seeking professional help can be an important step in managing pain and promoting overall health and well-being. While celebrities may have access to certain resources that the average person does not, their strategies for coping with pain on New Year's Day can still be helpful for anyone.

It can be challenging to handle anxiety in a world that is often fast-paced, demanding, and filled with countless triggers. However, there are ways to manage anxiety effectively, such as using fidget toys. Fidget toys are small, handheld objects that you can manipulate with your fingers. They come in various shapes and sizes, including spinners, cubes, and squishy balls. Playing with a fidget toy can help to redirect your anxious energy into a more positive outlet, thus reducing anxiety. One critical precaution when using fidget toys is to avoid picking at them, which can cause wear and tear over time. If you find yourself unable to resist picking at the toy, consider wearing gloves to reduce the damage. Gloves also provide an excellent sensory experience, which can be soothing for those who have sensory issues. Additionally, getting a manicure can also help reduce damage caused by anxiety-related behaviors. Healthy nails can be a visual reminder of the progress that you are making in managing anxiety symptoms. Also, painting your nails may provide a sense of accomplishment and a fun and creative outlet. In conclusion, managing anxiety needs a multi-faceted approach, and the use of fidget toys is a useful tool. However, it is essential to take cautionary measures to ensure that the fidget toy remains functional for a long time. Wearing gloves and getting a manicure are simple and effective ways to manage anxiety while protecting your fidget toys and nails.

In fact, the difference in yardage between the two throws is quite staggering. According to official records, Johnson's longest touchdown pass occurred during a game in 2003 when he was playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In that game, Johnson connected with wide receiver Joey Galloway on a 76-yard touchdown pass. Galloway caught the ball near midfield and was able to outrun the defense to the end zone. The pass was a thing of beauty, with Johnson putting just the right amount of touch on the ball to allow Galloway to catch it in stride. By contrast, Johnson's shortest touchdown pass was a much more modest affair. The pass occurred in a game during the 2002 season, also while he was playing for the Buccaneers. In that game, Johnson threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Ken Dilger. While the pass may not have been as impressive as his longer throws, it still resulted in points on the board for his team. So, just how many yards longer was Johnson's longest touchdown pass compared to his shortest? The answer is a whopping 74 yards. That's an impressive distance, and it's a testament to Johnson's arm strength and accuracy that he was able to make such a long throw with such precision. Of course, in the end, the exact number of yards doesn't really matter. What's important is that Johnson was able to get the job done when it mattered most, whether it was with a long bomb to Galloway or a short toss to Dilger. In the game of football, it's all about finding ways to score points, and Johnson proved himself to be a master of that art during his long and successful career."},{"instruction":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Punter, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, near = Café Sicil","output":"The Punter is a fast food coffee shop located near Café Sicilia."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","output":"Sentence: The cat chased the mouse.

Some scholars explain a Thursday crucifixion based on a double sabbath caused by an extra Passover sabbath falling on Thursday dusk to Friday afternoon, ahead of the normal weekly Sabbath. Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday, not Friday, on the grounds of the mention of three days and three nights in Matthew before his resurrection, celebrated on Sunday. Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a day and night may refer to any part of a 24hour period, that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic, not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb, and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights.

The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting. These terms came to a sudden halt following the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856, paving the way for German unification in the 1860s.

Treat with a prewash stain remover. Apply a liquid enzyme laundry detergent to the stain. Launder the clothing in the hottest water possible for the fabric. Hang clothes to air dry.","output":"When dealing with laundry stains, sometimes using traditional methods may not be enough to completely remove them. In cases when that happens, there are other methods that can be used to tackle stubborn stains. One of those methods is treating the stain with prewash stain remover, followed by applying a liquid enzyme laundry detergent on it. After that, launder the clothing in the hottest water possible for the fabric and hang it to air dry. Using prewash stain remover is a helpful step to take. Be sure to follow the instructions on the product's label when using it. Apply it directly on the stain, and let it sit for the recommended amount of time before washing the garment. This will loosen the stain and help the enzyme laundry detergent to work more efficiently. Enzyme laundry detergents contain protein-digesting enzymes that break down tough stains. Use a liquid enzyme laundry detergent to apply it directly onto the stain by pouring it on the affected area. Rub the detergent gently into the stain using a soft-bristled brush, and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. When it comes to laundering the garment, it's best to use the hottest water temperature possible for the fabric, as heat helps to break down stains. Check the care label to make sure you're not using too hot water that might damage the garment. Also, avoid using bleach, which can damage clothes and fade colors. To finish, hang the clothes up to air dry, preferably outside in the sun. The UV light from the sun can help to whiten clothes and eliminate any remaining stains. Avoid putting the garment in the dryer since heat can set any leftover stains, making them harder to remove next time. By following these simple steps, stubborn stains can be removed from clothes, leaving them looking and smelling fresh. Remember to always spot-test any stain removers on a hidden area of the fabric before applying it, and to read the care tag for instructions on the best way to care for the garment."},{"instruction":"Are the following two questions the same?

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recently admitted that her team had pressed ahead with the rollout despite concerns about the website's readiness, because they did not want to delay access to health care for millions of Americans. The fact that President Obama was not being kept informed of the biggest domestic program was a surprise to many. Sebelius recently testified before Congress that the President did not know about the website's problems until after it had launched. This lack of communication highlights a worrying disconnect between the administration and the implementation of the law.

However, many are left wondering why this team was not involved much earlier, before the website's disastrous launch. Despite the failure of the website, Sebelius has stated that the individual mandate, which requires all Americans to have health insurance or face a penalty, will not be delayed. This decision has sparked controversy, as many believe that the website's problems have made it difficult for people to comply with the law. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act has been frustrating for many Americans, but the government's commitment to improving access to health care should not be ignored.

Different types of food have different needs when it comes to storage, and it's important to follow these guidelines to avoid spoilage, contamination, and foodborne illness. Foods that need to be kept refrigerated or frozen should be stored accordingly. This will help prolong their shelf life and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. Additionally, food should never be stored in an open container, as this increases the risk of contamination. It's important to pay attention to use-by dates, as consuming expired food can lead to illness. Foods should also be kept separated to avoid cross-contamination.

According to the tradition, Virgil traveled to Greece in about 19 BC to revise the Aeneid.

After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on September 21, 19 BC. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard Virgil's own wish that the poem be burned, instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible. As a result, the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e. not a complete line of dactylic hexameter).

The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and The Hymn to Ninkasi, a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Check the root ball for damage: Make sure that the roots of your tree are healthy and undamaged before purchasing it. Look for any signs of rot, such as soggy soil or a foul smell. Damaged roots can prevent the tree from absorbing the water it needs to stay alive. 2. Limit the amount of time your tree is indoors: A live tree is meant to be outdoors, so it's important to limit the amount of time it spends inside your home. Ideally, your live tree should be indoors for no more than 10 days. 3. Keep your tree in a cool spot: Live trees prefer cooler temperatures, so don't place your tree next to a heat source like a fireplace or radiator. A cool spot in your home will help keep your tree healthy and happy. 4. Keep the soil moist: Make sure that the soil around your live Christmas tree stays moist, but not waterlogged. Check the soil daily and add water as needed. 5. Move your tree to a sheltered outdoor space: After the holiday season is over, move your live tree to a sheltered outdoor space like a porch or garage. This will help ease the transition from indoor to outdoor conditions. 6. Choose an open, sunny planting spot: When you're ready to plant your live Christmas tree, choose an open, sunny spot with well-drained soil. Avoid planting your tree in an area with heavy foot traffic or near buildings, as this can damage the tree's roots.

Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies.

One quick and easy way to spruce up your look is by simply checking yourself out in the mirror before you leave the house. This will help make sure you're ready for whatever the day has in store for you. Investing in a good pair of scissors is also a wise choice. They are not only useful for trimming hair, but they also come in handy for shaping facial hair or cutting nails. With the right pair, you can cut down on repeated grooming sessions and minimize the amount of time you spend away from your other activities. To take things a step further, you can set up your own home barbershop. Investing in a basic set of grooming tools like clippers, razors, and mirrors can help you achieve the perfect haircut at your convenience. Plus, you can save a considerable amount of money on salon fees in the long run. Finally, it's important to wash your hair regularly. This not only helps to keep it clean and healthy but also aids in avoiding the buildup of dirt or grease. While many people prefer to wash their hair every day, others opt to do so every other day to prevent their natural oils from being stripped away. Regardless of your routine, a clean scalp is essential for a well-groomed appearance."},{"instruction":"Arena Football League Starting in 2014, ESPN returned to the AFL as broadcast partners, with weekly games being shown on CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNEWS along with all games being broadcast on ESPN3 for free live on WatchESPN.

Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself.

The crime took place in July 2009 when Haynes was 23 and eight months pregnant. The prosecution presented evidence that showed that Corey struck Haynes repeatedly in the head, strangled her with an electrical cord from a lamp, and then sliced open her abdomen to take the baby. Corey went on to pass off the baby to her boyfriend, pretending it was her own child. The distressing case came to an end when she was found guilty of the crime. During the verdict, Corey sobbed uncontrollably and had to be removed from the courtroom due to her severe distress. While the verdict brings some measure of closure to the tragedy, it also serves as a reminder of the fragility of human life and the shocking lengths people can go to satisfy their desires. The horror of the murder was compounded by the fact that it was perpetrated on a pregnant woman, one of the most vulnerable members of society. Corey now faces a mandatory life sentence without parole, a fitting punishment for her terrible crime. The baby, who is now four years old, lives with her biological father in Worcester. One can only imagine the pain that he must have gone through, losing his partner and child in one of the most gruesome murders in recent memory.

In my book, that's not funny, that's pathetic. Low budget 'effects' (if I can even call them effects) with horrible cinematography. In many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money. Acting... I feel sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this? (looking at their recent filmography, it would appear so.)

While this surgery can be a lifesaving option in certain situations, it's important to evaluate the risks and benefits before making a decision. First, it's essential to ask your doctor whether a C-section will be risky for your baby. Some medical conditions, such as placenta previa or fetal distress, may make a C-section the safest choice. Additionally, women with certain health conditions, such as obesity or high blood pressure, may be at higher risk for complications during vaginal birth. However, even if your doctor does not recommend a C-section, it's important to evaluate the risks for yourself. While the procedure is generally safe, it does come with some potential risks, such as bleeding, infection, and blood clots. Additionally, babies born via C-section may be at higher risk for respiratory problems and breastfeeding difficulties. Despite these risks, some women still choose to have a C-section for convenience. For example, they may want to schedule their baby's birth around their work or social calendar, or they may be concerned about the pain of labor. However, it's important to remember that a C-section is a major surgery, and should not be taken lightly. If you are considering a C-section, it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your doctor. Ask about the potential risks and benefits, and discuss alternatives if a C-section is not medically necessary. Ultimately, the decision is up to you, but it's important to make an informed choice for the health and safety of both you and your baby."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

Whether it's a family gathering or a party with friends and colleagues, catering to different dietary choices is an important step towards hospitality. Vegetarian and vegan diets have become increasingly popular, and so it's essential to offer guests some snack options that are suitable for their dietary needs. Consider having a tray of fresh vegetables with hummus, guacamole or salsa dip, or serve up some homemade vegetarian/vegan bites. When it comes to serving the main course, you also need to be mindful of your guests’ dietary requirements. Using separate serving utensils for vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes shows respect and consideration for your guests, and helps avoid cross-contamination. Furthermore, consider serving each guest their dinner individually, plated with care. This adds an extra touch of elegance, and it is also a great way to avoid the risk of mixing up vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. For those who enjoy a nice cocktail, you can also offer vegan options that contain no animal products. There are tons of creative ways of making delicious cocktails without using animal products. For instance, you could make a refreshing and classic gin fizz, a fruity daiquiri, or add some fire to the night with a spicy margarita. Making vegan cocktails not only caters to your guests' dietary preferences but also adds diversity to your drinks menu. In conclusion, hosting an inclusive gathering requires a little bit of planning and thoughtful consideration. Offering vegetarian and vegan snack options and properly serving individual plates with separate utensils will ensure that your guests feel valued and respected, and vegan cocktails will add a touch of extra care to your beverage menu."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many points was the latter after the Dan Carpenter field goal?","output":"I'm sorry, but without additional information, I cannot write an article that answers the given question.

However, he quickly deleted the tweet and posted a follow-up message to inform fans that he had retrieved his data. The incident raised eyebrows because James is known to have lucrative endorsements with Samsung, one of the world's leading electronics brands. As one of the richest players in the NBA – with a net worth of around 185m – it is no surprise that he has been sought after by various companies over the years. Despite the occasional mishap, James has been a highly successful spokesperson for Samsung, featuring in a series of high-profile adverts for the brand. In these advertisements, he has showcased Samsung's latest products, extolling their virtues to his legion of fans. The incident with the tweet may have caused some embarrassment for James and his team, but it serves as a reminder of the importance of backing up important data. No matter how much money you have or how famous you are, losing important files can still be a major headache. So, while we can all enjoy a little bit of schadenfreude over LeBron James' phone troubles, let's also take this opportunity to make sure our own data is properly backed up and secure."},{"instruction":"also regret not going long on gold then , I 'd be a fucking millionaire by now .
