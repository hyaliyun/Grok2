However, his career came to a halt when his Supreme Court nomination in 1987 was unsuccessful, as he faced the largest-ever negative vote. Bork's nomination was not without opposition. He faced a fierce campaign against his appointment, which ultimately resulted in the creation of a new verb - 'to bork.' It refers to the vilification of nominees on ideological grounds. Despite falling short of getting confirmed for the Supreme Court, Bork's legacy and impact on politics and the law cannot be overlooked. Bork's controversial viewpoints on various issues have been the subject of debates in legal and political circles. He held a conservative and strict interpretation of the Constitution and was often criticized for his views on race, gender, and sexuality. Bork's nomination was strongly contested by the Senate, and ultimately President Reagan withdrew Bork's name, opting instead to nominate Anthony Kennedy, who was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Despite his defeat, Bork remained a respected figure in legal and political circles, and his influence was evident in subsequent debates about constitutional interpretation.

More than half of U.S. states have taken steps to limit public smoking since 2000. Smokefree policies have also been enacted in some other countries. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In recent years, there has been a surge of efforts to limit public smoking, and for good reason. According to several studies, laws that restrict public smoking can play a significant role in reducing hospital visits and deaths. Since 2000, more than half of the states in the U.S. have taken steps to enact smoke-free policies in public spaces such as restaurants, bars, and parks. This move has been widely welcomed by health experts, who cite the numerous benefits it can bring. One study, conducted by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, found that there was a significant reduction in hospitalizations for heart attacks and strokes in areas where smoking bans had been implemented. The researchers concluded that these laws played a crucial role in preventing heart and stroke-related illnesses, which can lead to premature deaths. Another study from the University of Kentucky found that smoke-free laws resulted in a 33 percent reduction in hospital admissions for respiratory problems in areas where such laws had been implemented. This is a strong indication that secondhand smoke can cause significant harm to non-smokers. Furthermore, smoke-free policies have also been enacted in several other countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In many cases, these laws have been found to greatly improve public health. Of course, enforcing laws that limit public smoking is not always easy, and there can be resistance from those who believe that they have a right to smoke in public spaces. However, health experts argue that the benefits of these laws far outweigh any short-term inconveniences. In conclusion, laws that limit public smoking have been shown to have a significant impact in reducing hospital visits and deaths related to smoking. While there may be some resistance to these laws, it is essential that we continue to push for smoke-free policies in public spaces to protect the health and well-being of everyone."},{"instruction":"w does the next paragraph end?

Striker Diego Costa will be unavailable due to a hamstring problem, which is a big blow for the team since he has been a key player this season. The absence of Ramires (groin), Andre Schurrle (illness), and John Mikel Obi (foot) will also be felt. Despite the absences, Chelsea is still looking to secure a win against Maribor. The Blues have had a strong start to the season, currently sitting at the top of the Premier League table. They also have a good record in the Champions League so far, winning their first two matches against Sporting Lisbon and Schalke 04. While losing Costa is a major setback, Chelsea has a strong squad with other players who can step up in his absence. Manager Jose Mourinho may opt to start Loic Remy, who has already scored two goals this season, or Didier Drogba, who has a wealth of experience in the Champions League. Maribor, on the other hand, has had a mixed start to their Champions League campaign. They drew with Sporting Lisbon in their first match but suffered a heavy 6-0 defeat to Schalke in their second game. They will be looking to bounce back against Chelsea, but it will be a difficult task for the Slovenian side.

She firmly believes that the company is responsible for the loss of her daughter's life. The lawsuit claims that inadequate safety measures were in place to stop the conveyor belt, and there were no warnings about the activation of sensors.

A neurosurgeon said the treen had no more than two weeks to live. But at a latenight emergency hearing, the woman insisted her son should be given another chance.","output":"Mrs Justice Hogg Grants Reprieve for 18-Year-Old Despite Dire Medical Prognosis In a recent court ruling, Mrs Justice Hogg has given a young man a second chance by blocking medical intervention to end his life. The 18-year-old was facing a bleak prognosis from a neurosurgeon who suspected that he would not survive more than two weeks without medical intervention. However, the patient's mother sought an emergency hearing to plead the case for her son's continued treatment. The hearing was a late-night emergency meeting, which saw the young man's mother come forth to advocate for her son's right to further treatment. Despite the neurosurgeon's assessment, Mrs Justice Hogg gave the young man a reprieve and overruled the medical decision to end his life. The ruling is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the importance of the patient's autonomy and their right to make informed decisions about their medical care. By blocking the medical intervention, Mrs Justice Hogg upheld the patient's right to choose their medical treatment, even in the face of a dire prognosis. Moreover, the ruling emphasises the need for doctors to consider patients on an individual basis, beyond just their medical prognosis. While the young man's medical condition was critical, there were still factors beyond his prognosis, such as his will to live and his family's strong desire for him to receive further treatment. The case also reminds us of the importance of the legal system's role in balancing the interests of patients, medical practitioners, and families. By intervening and going against the medical decision, the court illustrates that there is not always a straightforward answer when it comes to end of life treatment, and that legal intervention can sometimes be necessary. Overall, Mrs Justice Hogg's ruling in this case is an important reminder of the complexities of end-of-life decision-making and the need to ensure that individual patient's rights are upheld. The case highlights the importance of legal oversight in balancing individual autonomy, medical expertise, and family wishes, providing critical guidance in this difficult area of healthcare decision-making."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Ahmet Ertegun, genre, Blues; Ahmet Ertegun, origin, Washington, D.C.; Ahmet Ertegun, background, non performing personnel; Ahmet Ertegun, origin, United State","output":"Ahmet Ertegun, a non-performing personnel from Washington, D.C., became known for promoting Blues genre music in the United States."},{"instruction":"f I got mad., can we conclude that I was serene.?

If you notice any abnormal swelling or lumps under your skin, it is important to get imaging studies done on your lymph nodes. This will help determine if the swelling is caused by lymphoma or another condition. In addition, a biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the type of lymphoma. After diagnosis, staging testing should be conducted to determine the extent of the lymphoma and if it has spread to any other parts of the body. This will help doctors create the best possible treatment plan for you. It is also important to have tests done for specific types of lymphoma. There are different types of lymphoma, each with its own characteristics and treatment plan. Knowing the specific type of lymphoma you have will help your doctor determine the best course of treatment. Getting a second opinion is also a good idea, especially if you have any doubts about the diagnosis or the proposed treatment plan.

During the Battle for Leyte Gulf, Admiral William Halsey was commanding the Third Fleet of the United States Navy. On October 24, 1944, Halsey received intelligence reports that a Japanese carrier force was operating in the Philippine Sea. Believing that this carrier force posed a significant threat to the American landing at Leyte Gulf, Halsey decided to detach a task group from his fleet to pursue the Japanese carriers. This task group, led by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman, included four fast battleships, six cruisers, and ten destroyers. They immediately set out in pursuit of the Japanese carrier force, which they engaged in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944. Meanwhile, the rest of Halsey's fleet remained at Leyte Gulf to support the American landings and protect the transports. On October 25-26, they engaged in a series of fierce battles with the Japanese fleet, culminating in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Ultimately, the American fleet was victorious in the Battle for Leyte Gulf. However, Halsey's decision to detach a task group to pursue the Japanese carriers has been criticized by some historians for leaving the American transports at Leyte Gulf vulnerable to attack. Despite this criticism, Halsey's aggressive tactics were praised by others as a bold and effective strategy. In conclusion, Halsey detached a task group before the conclusion of the Battle for Leyte Gulf.

Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming.

But compared to each other, how do the longest touchdowns stack up against the longest field goals? As of 2021, the record for longest NFL touchdown is held by Antonio Cromartie and Devin Hester, both with 109 yards. In comparison, the longest NFL field goal record is held by Matt Prater with a 64-yard kick. This means the two longest touchdowns measure 45 yards more than the longest field goal. But that's just looking at the records. It's worth noting that most touchdowns range between 5-10 yards, with anything over 50 yards being a rarity. Field goals, on the other hand, can range from just a few yards to over 50 yards. So while the long touchdown records are impressive, they aren't necessarily indicative of the typical distances we see in games. In fact, in terms of average distances, field goals tend to be longer than touchdowns. The average NFL touchdown distance is around 25 yards, while field goals average around 37 yards. This is likely due to the fact that field goals are often attempted when a team is just outside of the end zone, but too far for a reliable touchdown attempt. So while the two longest touchdowns may measure 45 yards more than the longest field goal, it's important to remember that touchdowns and field goals are measured on different scales. When looking at the average distances, field goals tend to be longer than touchdowns. Regardless, both are important aspects of the game and can greatly impact a team's success."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Blake is at the airport waiting for his flight to Paris.

If it is still stubborn, use a mallet to make even cuts on the opposite side. Switch the slate to a flat edge (such as on the surface of a fireplace) and continue. Mark and cut the top of the slate when using power tools.

Coyote hunting may be legal in some areas but may be prohibited in others. It's crucial to be aware of these regulations to avoid violating the law and facing penalties. Once you've confirmed that coyote hunting is legal in your area, the next step is to know where to look for them. Coyotes are not easy to find, as they are intelligent and elusive animals. A good way to increase your chances of spotting them is to look for their tracks and scat. Coyotes are often found in open areas such as fields and meadows, but they can also be found in wooded areas. Finally, it's essential to bring an appropriate weapon on your hunt. The type of weapon you need depends on your hunting preferences and local regulations. In some areas, a rifle may be the best option for taking down coyotes at a distance. Alternatively, a shotgun may be more suitable for close-range hunting. In conclusion, hunting coyotes can be a fun and rewarding experience when done correctly.

Chelsea were among the busiest of sides, selling several unwanted players and bringing in some quality additions. One of the key signings for Jose Mourinho's side was Diego Costa, who has helped fire them to the top of the table with some impressive performances. Costa has been in fine form since his move from Atletico Madrid, scoring several crucial goals to help Chelsea maintain their unbeaten start to the season. Meanwhile, Danny Welbeck also has a point to prove after leaving Manchester United to join Arsenal in a £16million deadline day deal. The 23-year-old forward will be looking to prove his worth on the pitch for his new club and help them secure a top-four finish this season. But it's not just the big clubs that have been making waves in the transfer market. Hull City have made some inspired signings, including Hatem Ben Arfa on loan from Newcastle United. The French international has been in excellent form since his move to the KC Stadium, and he will be hoping to help Hull challenge for a place in the top half of the table this season. Another club that has been busy in the transfer market is QPR, who have signed Sandro to give them a strong presence in central midfield. The Brazilian international is a tough-tackling midfielder who should provide some much-needed steel to QPR's midfield this season. There were also several big-name players who could have added a great deal to the Premier League, but who moved elsewhere instead. Xabi Alonso and Toni Kroos both opted to join Real Madrid, and while they would have been great additions to the Premier League, they will now ply their trade in La Liga. In the end, the summer transfer window was a mixed bag for Premier League clubs. Some will be pleased with their business, while others may feel they could have done more.

The Post reported from Zegart's book that government documents show the CIA and FBI missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community. The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective counterterrorism or counterintelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change.

Almost two days later, Norwood was arrested and charged with attempted murder. According to Norwood's mother, the argument started over 10. This incident highlights the danger of letting an argument escalate to violence. It is never worth risking the safety and wellbeing of oneself or others over a minor disagreement.

The incident took place in broad daylight and the victim suffered major injuries. When Pereira reported the crime to the police, he was instead arrested on an outstanding warrant.

It is concerning that a victim reporting a crime could be penalized for having an outstanding warrant.

The incident has also shed light on the issue of violence against men, which is often overlooked in discussions about gender-based violence. Violence of any form is unacceptable, and it is important for society to address all forms of violence. Authorities must ensure that justice is served and that perpetrators of violence are held accountable for their actions. It is also crucial that victims are provided with the necessary support to recover from their trauma.

Let cake cool.","output":"Separating the eggs is a crucial step in many baking recipes. By separating the yolks from the whites, you can achieve different textures and flavors in your baked goods. The yolks add richness and moisture, while the whites provide structure and lift. When it comes to cakes, separating the eggs is especially important in recipes that call for whipping the egg whites to stiff peaks before folding them into the batter. This extra step creates a light and fluffy texture that makes for an impressive cake. Once your cake has finished baking, it's important to let it cool completely before attempting to frost or decorate it. This ensures that the frosting won't melt or slide off and that the cake won't crumble or fall apart. If you're short on time and can't wait for the cake to cool naturally, you can speed up the process by placing it in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes. Just be careful not to leave it in too long, as this can dry out the cake or cause it to become too hard to work with. In conclusion, separating the eggs and letting your cake cool are essential steps in achieving a delicious and visually appealing dessert. Don't skip these steps, as they can greatly affect the outcome of your baking endeavors."},{"instruction":"With a Queensland state election coming up in Australia, many minor parties and independents will be looking to hold balance of power and making the major parties listen to what they have to say.

Once you have determined the cost of attendance, it is necessary to evaluate potential sources of income. This may include scholarships, grants, work-study programs, and student loans.

Creating a budget based on your cost of attendance and available funding sources will allow you to better manage your resources.

But have you ever tried roasting them in the oven? Not only does it bring out a deliciously rich, nutty flavor, but it also saves time compared to roasting them on the stove. To start, preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C) and spread your pistachios in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. It's important to use a rimmed baking sheet so the pistachios don't roll off when you give the sheet a shake during roasting. Once your oven is heated up, pop the baking sheet in and let the pistachios roast for 6 to 8 minutes. Keep a close eye on them—you want them to become fragrant and lightly browned, but not burnt. Depending on your oven, these times may vary slightly. Once they're done, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pistachios cool for a few minutes. At this point, you can either eat them hot out of the oven or store them for later use. Roasted pistachios are a great addition to a variety of dishes, from salads to baked goods to snack mixes. They also make a delicious and healthy snack on their own. Plus, roasting them in the oven frees up your stove for other cooking projects. So next time you're looking to add some extra flavor and crunch to your favorite dish, consider roasting your pistachios in the oven.

Like most Roman peace treaties of the period, the resultant 'Peace of Flaminius' was designed utterly to crush the power of the defeated party; a massive indemnity was levied, Philip's fleet was surrendered to Rome, and Macedon was effectively returned to its ancient boundaries, losing influence over the citystates of southern Greece, and land in Thrace and Asia Minor.

In fact, his first attempts at filmmaking were not well received. It wasn't until he started making comedies that he found his niche. His films often tackle social and political issues with a touch of humor, a style that has earned him comparisons to American filmmaker Woody Allen. Despite his success, Feng has never lost sight of his roots. He often pays homage to his early work and credits his television background for his strong storytelling skills. \\"Television taught me how to tell a story,\\" he once said in an interview. \\"In TV, you have limited resources, so you have to be resourceful in how you tell a story. That's a skill that has served me well in filmmaking.\\" Feng Xiaogang's success story is an inspiring one for aspiring filmmakers. It shows that with hard work, perseverance, and a willingness to learn, anyone can achieve their dreams. Today, Feng continues to be a major force in China's entertainment industry and is considered one of the country's most talented directors."},{"instruction":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: the protected site is part .","output":"protected, site, part."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: I'm no saint, the 80yearold Tallahasseean said.

Make the opening lines powerful and engaging, drawing your readers into the world you've created. The more invested they are in the story, the more likely they are to keep reading. As your story unfolds, make sure your protagonist deals with a single conflict throughout. Whether it's a personal obstacle or an external challenge, make it something that really tests your character's resolve. You want your readers to be invested in your character's journey, so it's important to make this conflict meaningful and relatable. However, the climax of your story should be a surprise ending.

In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solidstate (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production and the use of modern polyester dielectric barriers this oncecommon problem has become relatively rare.

In most team sports, the time is divided into two halves, each with distinct strategies and opportunities for scoring. In this article, we will review the recent games of four popular sports and report on the total points scored in the first half. Basketball: Basketball is a fast-paced game that requires good shooting, passing, and defense skills. In the NBA, a typical game lasts for 48 minutes, divided into four quarters of 12 minutes each. In a recent game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors on March 15th, 2021, the Lakers led the first half with a score of 55-42. This means that the Lakers scored 55 points, while the Warriors scored 42 points in the first and second quarters combined. Football: Football, also known as soccer, is a widely popular sport around the world that involves 11 players on each team trying to kick a ball into the opponent's goal. In most professional and international matches, the playing time is 90 minutes, divided into two halves of 45 minutes each. In a recent game between the English Premier League teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur on March 14th, 2021, the first half ended with a score of 1-1. This means that each team scored one goal in the first 45 minutes. American Football: American football is a complex and physically demanding game that requires teamwork, skill, and strategy. In the NFL, a typical game lasts for 60 minutes, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each. In a recent game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Super Bowl LV on February 7th, 2021, the first half ended with a score of 6-21. This means that the Chiefs scored two field goals (each worth three points) while the Buccaneers scored three touchdowns (each worth six points) and three extra points (each worth one point). Rugby: Rugby is a full-contact sport that originated in England and spread globally, with different variations and rules. In most professional rugby union matches, the playing time is 80 minutes, divided into two halves of 40 minutes each. In a recent game between Wales and England in the Six Nations Championship on February 27th, 2021, the first half ended with a score of 17-6. This means that Wales scored two tries (each worth five points) and one penalty kick (worth three points), while England scored two penalty kicks. In conclusion, the total points scored in the first half of a game depends on various factors such as the nature of the sport, the skill level of the players, the competing strategies of the teams, and the randomness of the events. However, by reviewing recent games and tracking the scoreboards, we can get a general idea of how much each team scored in the first half and how this influenced the final outcome."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...who sang the lights went out in georgia originally??","output":"Vicki Lawrence sang \\"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\\" originally."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: The DNRF will send full applications to three international foreign highlevel experts within the relevant scientific areas for external peer review","output":"The DNRF will send full applications to three international, foreign, high-level experts within the relevant scientific areas for external peer review."},{"instruction":"What is an example of a tweet?","output":"\\"Just had the best cup of coffee from my favorite café! ☕️ #coffeeholic #caffeineaddict\\""},{"instruction":"The way Miller describes it to be a challenge to speak of something ' so intimate in a simple way ' .

It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest.

Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes.

One of the first things you need to do is build a support frame for the window. This is especially important if your window will be perpendicular to the floor joists. The support frame will ensure that the window is properly supported and securely fastened into place. Once you have built the support frame, the next step is to hang plastic sheeting along the frame to contain the dust. This is an important step because cutting through concrete can create a lot of dust, which can spread throughout your home if you don’t take proper precautions. By hanging the plastic sheeting, you contain the dust and minimize the mess. The next step is to cut a groove around the inside perimeter of the window with a concrete saw. This groove should be about the same width as the thickness of your wall. Once you have created the groove, you can use it as a guide to cut halfway through the wall along the groove you created. It is important to make sure that you cut halfway through the wall and not all the way through. After you have cut halfway through the wall, you need to cut through the other side of the wall in the same manner. This will create a complete opening that is the same size and shape as your window. Once you have created the opening, you can insert your window into place and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that it is properly secured. In summary, installing a window in a concrete wall requires careful planning and attention to detail. By building a support frame, hanging plastic sheeting, and cutting a groove around the inside perimeter of the window with a concrete saw, you can create a clean and precise opening for your window."},{"instruction":"Write a story that ends with this sentence.
