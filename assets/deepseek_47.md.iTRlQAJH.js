But please, MC, you need to talk to Sayori. She's really upset.\\" MC nodded. MC: \\"I will. Thanks, Natsuki.\\" I left MC's house and walked back to the clubroom, feeling like I had just walked into a soap opera. But at least now I knew what was going on. I walked back into the clubroom, where the girls were still waiting for me.

I didn't want to hurt you, but I realize now that I only made things worse. Can you forgive me?\\" Sayori smiled and nodded. Sayori: \\"Of course, MC.

When game designer Shruti Ghosh sold her apartment to help fund the development of Raji: An Ancient Epic, many thought this was a reckless gamble on a frivolous project. But Shruti was making an investment in her future. And it paid off. From the time Raji was released in August 2020, the game has enjoyed a number of ‘firsts’: being part of Nintendo Indie World showcase, being first indie studio from India to receive an Unreal development grant, being nominated for the Best Debut Indie Game for The Games Awards (‘the Oscars for video games’), and, more recently, a BAFTA Breakthrough Honoree recognition for Shruti. The lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 urged us to consider gaming as a new outlet of self-entertainment and even socialising... or even a potential source of sustainable income . And while we may very well be busy with Fortnite or Dota 2, a growing curiosity for India-made games is finally being fed by creative developers, who have struck while the industry iron is hot. Pune-based Nodding Heads Games, the studio behind Raji: An Ancient Epic (2020), created one of the most remarkable landmark video games in Indian history. Along with Shruti, co-founders Avichal Singh and Ian Maude, brought a gamified dimension to a world inspired by Indian mythology and medieval architecture. Since its trailer reveal, the action-adventure hack-and-slash has won the hearts of gamers and game developers alike, all thrilled to see a PC and console experience from a studio that embraces its cultural essence. Sporting a more brutal art style and gameplay than Raji, is Hyderabad-based Ogre Head Studios’ upcoming Yodha which is still in development. Founder Zain Fahadh notes the changing climate of PC game development in India has been a catalyst for Yodha’s evolution while also bringing an international spotlight to Yodha, following the success of their 2017 game Asura Vengeance Edition. Similarly, back in 2009, ninth-grader Nikhil Malankar was playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City as a mafia gangster running various errands for various crime lords. Fascinated by the open-world concept as he explored a pixellated Miami, Nikhil started modding (using code to modify a game to create a new experience) to create a microcosmic Mumbai. AAA (big-budget blockbuster) games such as Hitman 2 showcase a slice of Mumbai, but Nikhil wanted to create something entirely devoted to the variety of the city. Years later in 2013, this experience would mark Nikhil creating GameEon Studios, Mumbai, and the eventual creation of role-playing game (RPG) Mumbai Gullies which hopes to take the player through the duality of Mumbai and Bombay. Development hit some hurdles; given mobile games were ‘of the zeitgeist’ at the time, the investment well for Indian-made PC games was dry, but gamers were adamant about wanting to fill this void in PC gaming. The money game Funding is certainly a viable obstacle in game development, especially for indie studios like Nodding Heads and GameEon; and much of this is due to the immobile mindsets of investors who have long-perceived India-made games as low quality or with low-brow content. But we are seeing a slow evolution in this mindset. Avichal is candid about the tumultuous journey behind Raji: “Being Indian indie developers, we had to go the extra mile to secure a publishing deal which is not the case for our counterpart Western indie teams. A lot of people were skeptical.” Perhaps this is why GameEon Studios turned to crowd-funding; a move which proved successful as they ultimately raised ₹1.77 lakhs which finally kicked off development in November 2020. At Indian Gamer Developer Conference — where Nikhil is also an organiser — a demo of Mumbai Gullies was finally unveiled. At the end of 2022, a prologue version of the game will be released while Mumbai Gullies Final Chapter is set for a 2025 release. Avichal also points out: “Another misconception is that games inspired from India are going to hurt sentiments of a certain section of people; this is something that Indian devs would know how to take care of like we did in Raji.” For years, Indian tech studios such as Dhruva Interactive (which later got acquired by Rockstar Games) have been outsourced by AAA (big budget, blockbuster) studios like Ubisoft, Rockstar Games or Capcom to create motion-capture animations and other renderings for big title games. Nikhil suggests that “now is the time” that homegrown studios work with these entities to create a richer and more collaborative ecosystem for game development. Into the culture Earlier this year, gamers were given another chance to explore the ruins of the Hoysala empire of South India through a next-gen remaster of Naughty Dog’s Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. The game follows thief-for-hire Chloe Frazer and former mercenary Nadine Ross on a quest to find the Tusk of Ganesh. The hunt takes them through a rainy and crowded Chennai, verdant jungles of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and across underground ruins riddled with intricate stonework, gripping mythologies, dangerous traps and engaging puzzles. Gamers everywhere were thrilled that one of the biggest franchises — now being turned into a movie starring Tom Holland — put a cultural spotlight on India. And this year’s remaster of the game propelled a renewed interest in India-based games. Perhaps a precursor to culturally-niche video games is an under-discussed 2017 creation of Wandermind Labs and UnderDOGS Gaming Studio: Mukti. A first-person story exploration game set in a museum in the Sunderbans, West Bengal. You play as Arya Roy who must clear her grandfather’s name after his museum has been vandalised. Similarly, Toronto-based developer Visai Studios’ 2020 indie video game Venba, a 2D storified narrative game on the various cooking styles of South Indian food — from idlis to a simple aloo fry — sees the gamer play as an Indian mom, who migrates to Canada with her family in the 1980s. The game got a lot of love from gamers and fellow developers alike for its unexpected comfort factor. Also Read | Venba, an indie narrative cooking game, has South Indian cuisine and immigrants at its centre “International games such as Uncharted: The Lost Legacy and Hi Rez Studios’ Smite are great examples of utilising Indian lore and mythology. They shine a light on our culture and heritage; this, in turn, truly shows how vast and rich Indian heritage is,” avers Avichal. Avichal then recalls how he learned young adults told him that Raji was the first game their parents participated in. He adds, “So many parents from India and NRIs, and so many people from around the world played Raji and messaged us on how fulfilling the experience has been for them. People simply curious to know about the gods and goddesses, learnt about their backstory.” Gaming is, and should be, for everyone. That has not always been reflected in the characters we get to play as, be they created by developers or for ourselves. But now, game developers are empowered to bring India to global screens and share our stories in interactive ways.","output":"Gaming has become one of the most popular forms of entertainment, with people turning to it as a new outlet during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021.

Her condition could be indicative of a neuromuscular disorder or neurological dysfunction. Condition: Jessica's condition significantly impacts her daily activities and independence. With a 1/5 strength score for her right arm, she struggles with basic activities such as lifting objects, writing, and using utensils. Her left arm exhibits greater muscle strength with a score of 4/5, but it is insufficient to compensate for her right arm. Additionally, Jessica's right leg muscle strength (2/5) indicates difficulty with mobility and support, and complete muscle weakness in her left leg (0/5) suggests a need for assistance or mobility aid for basic locomotion. Ability to Accomplish Tasks Independently: Given the disparate strength in her limbs, Jessica faces significant challenges in accomplishing daily tasks without assistance. It is strongly advised that she seek medical intervention and explore potential physical therapy and/or assistive devices to improve her quality of life and foster independence in activities of daily living. ----- Patient 2: Britt Lindqvist Sex: Female Age: 20 Diagnosis: Britt experiences muscle weakness in her left arm and significant muscle weakness in both legs. This could be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle injury or a possible neurological issue. Condition: Britt has a normal muscle strength score of 5/5 for her right arm, while her left arm is slightly compromised at 4/5. This asymmetry in upper limb strength may lead to challenges with activities that require bilateral coordination, such as lifting heavy objects. Her lower body demonstrates substantial muscle weakness- her right leg having no muscle activation (0/5) and her left leg with minimal strength (1/5). This severely affects her ability to stand, walk, and maintain balance. Ability to Accomplish Tasks Independently: Britt's lower body weakness poses significant challenges to her independence and mobility. It is advised that she seek medical evaluation to determine the root cause of this muscle weakness and undergo appropriate treatment to improve functionality. She may benefit from physical therapy and potential mobility aids. ----- Patient 3: Caroline Hertig Sex: Female Age: 29 Diagnosis: Caroline's overall muscle strength is adequate in her upper body but demonstrates reduced strength in her legs, especially the left leg. The diagnosis would require additional investigation, but she could be experiencing a lower-body musculoskeletal issue or a neurological problem affecting her lower extremities. Condition: With 5/5 muscle strength in both arms, Caroline possesses adequate upper body strength. Her right leg strength is diminished at 1/5, and her left leg exhibits complete muscle weakness at 0/5. This impacts her standing, walking, and balance abilities. Ability to Accomplish Tasks Independently: Caroline's upper body strength allows her to independently perform daily tasks that do not require significant mobility or lower body strength. However, her lower body limitations necessitate assistance or mobility aids for activities that involve standing or walking. Medical evaluation, treatment, and potential physical therapy are recommended to improve her lower body functionality. ----- Patient 4: Franchette Fappier Sex: Female Age: 28 Diagnosis: Franchette displays adequate muscle strength in her arms but experiences reduced strength in her legs. Additional investigation is needed to determine the precise cause of her condition, which could be due to musculoskeletal injury or a neurological issue. Condition: Franchette demonstrates 5/5 muscle strength in both arms, allowing her to perform activities requiring upper body strength. However, she exhibits diminished strength in her right leg (1/5) and her left leg (2/5). These limitations impact her ability to stand, walk, and maintain balance. Ability to Accomplish Tasks Independently: Franchette's ability to independently perform everyday tasks varies depending on the demand placed on her lower body. While her upper body strength allows her to function independently in many activities, her lower body weakness may require assistance or mobility aids for tasks involving standing or walking. It is advised that she undergo medical evaluation and appropriate interventions to improve her lower body function. ----- Patient 5: Loretta Miller Sex: Female Age: 24 Diagnosis: Loretta experiences global muscle weakness, with significant issues in both arms and legs. Her condition could be linked to a neuromuscular disorder or a general neurological dysfunction. Condition: With muscle strength scores of 0/5 for her right arm and her left arm, she struggles with basic activities such as lifting objects, writing, and using utensils. Both legs also exhibit complete muscle weakness (0/5), indicating the inability to stand, walk, or maintain balance independently. Ability to Accomplish Tasks Independently: Loretta's muscle weakness severely impacts her ability to accomplish daily tasks independently. She would likely require assistance with most activities and may rely heavily on assistive devices or mobility aids. It is critical that Loretta undergo medical evaluation to identify the cause of her muscle weakness and receive appropriate treatment to improve her quality of life and functionality. ----- Patient 6: Alienor Cuillerier Sex: Female Age: Not provided Diagnosis: Alienor demonstrates complete muscle weakness in both arms and significant weakness in her left leg. This could be indicative of a neuromuscular disorder or neurological dysfunction affecting her limbs. Condition: Both of Alienor's arms exhibit a muscle strength score of 0/5, severely affecting functionality. Her left leg also displays complete muscle weakness (0/5) impacting her ability to stand, walk, and balance. However, her right leg presents a moderate level of muscle strength (3/5). Ability to Accomplish Tasks Independently: Alienor's ability to accomplish daily tasks independently is profoundly impacted by her muscle weakness. Assistance and the use of mobility aids are likely necessary for her to achieve basic functionality. Medical evaluation, appropriate treatment, and potential physical therapy are highly recommended to improve her independence and quality of life. ----- Patient 7: Veronique Aubry Sex: Female Age: Not provided Diagnosis: Veronique experiences significant muscle weakness in her arms and variable muscle strength in her legs. Additional investigation is needed to determine whether her condition is due to musculoskeletal or neurological issues. Condition: Veronique's muscle strength scores are 0/5 for her right arm and 1/5 for her left arm, resulting in substantial functional limitations. She demonstrates 5/5 muscle strength in her right leg and moderate strength (4/5) in her left leg. This asymmetry may result in challenges with balance and mobility. Ability to Accomplish Tasks Independently: Veronique's compromised arm strength significantly affects her ability to perform upper body tasks independently. Assistance may be necessary for daily activities involving her arms and for tasks that require balance or coordination due to the difference in leg strength. Medical evaluation and appropriate interventions, including physical therapy, are advised to improve her condition and facilitate greater independence."},{"instruction":"اعطني طريقه لتتبيث البنق علي ٢٠في لعبة بوبجي","output":"لا يمكنني تقديم هذا النوع من المشورة، حيث أن زيادة البنق يمكن أن يعتمد على العديد من العوامل المختلفة، مثل سرعة الاتصال بالإنترنت وسرعة جهاز الكمبيوتر وتلك الظروف الأخرى التي تؤثر على تجربة اللعب. لذلك، ينبغي عليك البحث عن النصائح والحيل المتاحة عبر الإنترنت ومن خلال المنتديات المختلفة."},{"instruction":"отлаживаю программу с помощью gdb , которая собрана в другом каталоге. как gdb указать, что сейчас мои исходники находятся по другому пути","output":"Для указания пути к исходным файлам в gdb можно использовать команду \\"directory\\" или \\"dir\\".

Questo collegamento tra programmabilità della costituzione e tema dell'infinito può essere utile per riflettere sulle sfide attuali e future del sistema costituzionale e sulle modalità in cui quest'ultimo può essere adattato per garantire la tutela dei diritti e delle libertà dei cittadini."},{"instruction":"the manifest destiny","output":"The Manifest Destiny was a 19th-century belief among Americans that it was their God-given destiny to expand westward across the North American continent. The idea was rooted in notions of American exceptionalism and the belief in the inherent superiority of American institutions and values. It was fueled by a combination of religious, political, and economic motives, and was used to justify the annexation of new territories, including Texas, California, and Oregon. The Manifest Destiny was not without controversy, however. Many opposed the idea as a justification for aggression, greed and imperialism, especially as it led to the forced removal of Native American populations and the annexation of territories previously held by Mexico. Despite its mixed legacy, the Manifest Destiny remains an important part of American history and culture, providing a lens through which to view the country's westward expansion and the complex social, economic and political forces that drove it."},{"instruction":"sublimazione e desublimazione scuola di francoforte","output":"La scuola di Francoforte, un movimento di pensiero critico e filosofico sviluppatosi dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, ha sviluppato il concetto di sublimazione e desublimazione come strumenti di analisi culturale e sociale. La sublimazione si riferisce alla trasformazione di desideri e bisogni umani in forme socialmente accettabili. Ad esempio, la parola scritta può sublimare i nostri desideri emotivi in modo che non siano troppo espliciti o offensivi. La scuola di Francoforte ha sostenuto che questo processo di sublimazione può essere utilizzato dalle forze dominanti della società per produrre ideologie che giustificano l'ordine esistente. D'altra parte, la desublimazione si riferisce alla liberazione di desideri e bisogni umani in forme fisiche o sessuali, come quella che si può trovare nella cultura popolare contemporanea. La scuola di Francoforte ha sostenuto che la desublimazione può portare alla liberazione e all'espansione della coscienza umana, ma può anche essere utilizzata dalle forze dominanti per manipolare la società e le sue repressioni emotive. In sintesi, la scuola di Francoforte ha utilizzato i concetti di sublimazione e desublimazione per analizzare il ruolo della cultura e della società nel modellare i desideri e i bisogni umani e per criticare le forze dominanti che sostengono l'ordine esistente."},{"instruction":"concetto di natura in leopardi e d'annunzio","output":"Il concetto di natura è un tema centrale nella poesia di Leopardi e D'Annunzio, ma viene esplorato in modo molto diverso dai due autori. Per Leopardi, la natura è vista come un grande maestro che insegna la bellezza e la grandezza del mondo, ma anche come un'entità indifferente e spietata, governata dalle leggi del destino e dell'inevitabile decadimento. La sua poesia riflette una profonda tristezza e amarezza nei confronti del mondo naturale e del suo ciclo incessante di nascita e morte. Inoltre, la natura diventa anche un simbolo della solitudine e dell'alienazione umana, che per Leopardi è una realtà ineluttabile. D'altra parte, per D'Annunzio la natura è vista in modo molto più positivo e celebrativo. In alcune delle sue opere, come \\"Il Piacere\\", la natura è vista come un ambiente di lussuria e sensualità, che fornisce una fonte inesauribile di piacere fisico ed emotivo. In altre opere, come \\"Notturno\\", la natura viene invece vista come un elemento di bellezza e armonia, capace di elevare e ispirare l'anima umana. In sintesi, il concetto di natura per Leopardi è caratterizzata da un senso di fatalismo e ineluttabilità, mentre per D'Annunzio rappresenta un'opportunità per l'esperienza estetica e la sensualità."},{"instruction":"movimenti operai in storia come li collego al tema degli opposti","output":"I movimenti operai nella storia possono essere collegati al tema degli opposti in diverse modalità. Innanzitutto, i movimenti operai pongono in tensione opposti come capitale e lavoro, ricchezza e povertà, opulenza e sfruttamento, egemonia e sottomissione. La lotta dei lavoratori e dei sindacati contro le imprese e le politiche capitalistiche si basa su questa tensione tra opposti, cercando di ottenere condizioni di lavoro e di vita più eque e giuste. Inoltre, i movimenti operai hanno portato alla luce opposti culturali e ideologici come le posizioni politiche contrapposte di classe e la lotta tra il tradizionalismo e l'innovazione. Questo si riflette nella storia dei conflitti sociali tra i lavoratori e i loro datori di lavoro. Ma i movimenti operai non sono stati solo un aspetto di opposizione e lotta: attraverso la cooperazione e la solidarietà tra i lavoratori, si sono sviluppati opposti positivi come l'unione e la fratellanza tra gli individui, la capacità di lottare per i propri diritti e la creatività tramite l'organizzazione di scioperi e manifestazioni. In generale, possiamo dire che i movimenti operai nella storia rappresentano un campo di tensione tra opposti che si riflettono nelle dinamiche sociali, culturali, politiche ed economiche della società. Questa tensione tra opposti ha portato a grandi trasformazioni nella storia dell'umanità, come la lotta per i diritti dei lavoratori e l'emancipazione dalle condizioni di sfruttamento e oppressione."},{"instruction":"hanna arendt","output":"Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) è stata una filosofa politica e teorica sociale tedesca-americana, nota per il suo lavoro su una vasta gamma di temi che spaziano dalla filosofia politica al totalitarismo, alla teoria dell'azione e alla filosofia della storia. Uno dei contributi principali di Arendt alla filosofia politica è stata la sua teoria dell'agire come fondamento della vita politica. Secondo Arendt, l'agire non si limita semplicemente alla decisione, ma alla manifestazione di una volontà libera e autonoma, lontana da ogni contingenza e rappresenta l'unica modalità attraverso cui una persona può realmente raggiungere la libertà. Ciò ha portato Arendt a criticare molte idee predominanti nella filosofia politica dei suoi tempi, come la concezione della politica come semplice questione di scelta tra varie opzioni, di cui la decisione assume un ruolo centrale, e l'idea che la politica non riguarda l'individuo ma il bene comune. Arendt è anche nota per la sua analisi del totalitarismo e per il suo libro The Origins of Totalitarianism, dove sostiene che questi movimenti politici sono fondati sull'idea di una società composta da una sola razza, di una sola nazione e di una sola classe, e porta alla totale eliminazione dei diritti e delle libertà individuali. Arendt ha anche sviluppato il concetto di \\"banalità del male\\", in cui ha esaminato il comportamento di funzionari del governo e di altri individui che hanno contribuito all'Olocausto e l'ha descritto come una sorta di cieca obbedienza alle autorità, anziché come una perfida intenzione. In sintesi, la pensiero di Hannah Arendt ha cercato di capire e criticare le dinamiche politiche, sociali e morali dei suoi tempi, riflettendo sulla natura dell'agire, la natura della violenza e del totalitarismo e del male in generale, ed esplorando la relazione tra l'individuo e la società."},{"instruction":"descrizione finzione costante e periodica matematica","output":"La finzione costante e periodica in matematica è una funzione temporale che mantiene un valore costante o varia continuamente in modo regolare nel tempo. Tale funzione può essere descritta da una formula matematica che fornisce il valore costante o la serie di valori periodici. Ad esempio, la funzione costante potrebbe essere descritta come f(x) = c, dove c rappresenta il valore costante che la funzione mantiene costante nel tempo. Allo stesso modo, la funzione periodica potrebbe essere descritta come f(x) = sin(x) o f(x) = cos(x), dove il valore della funzione oscilla regolarmente tra 1 e -1 in base al valore di x. Questi tipi di funzioni costanti e periodiche sono spesso utilizzati in matematica applicata, come nell'analisi dei segnali o nella costruzione di modelli matematici di fenomeni naturali, come il movimento ondulatorio o i modelli del clima. Inoltre, nel calcolo differenziale e integrale, queste funzioni sono spesso utilizzate come punti di riferimento per il calcolo di derivati e integrali di altre funzioni. In sintesi, la finzione costante e periodica in matematica rappresenta una classe di funzioni che rimangono costanti o variano in modo regolare nel tempo, e postulando una formula matematica per tale funzione, permette di analizzarne le proprietà e di utilizzarle come punti di riferimento per altri calcoli matematici."},{"instruction":"modelli matematici collegati a forme e varietà dei linguaggi","output":"In matematica, il concetto di forma e varietà dei linguaggi ha una connessione diretta con i modelli matematici. In particolare, un modello matematico è una rappresentazione semplificata di un sistema dell mondo reale che consente di analizzarlo e osservarne le proprietà. In questo contesto, la forma dei linguaggi si riferisce alla struttura delle parole e delle frasi che compongono una lingua, mentre la varietà dei linguaggi è il numero e la diversità delle lingue esistenti in tutto il mondo. Un esempio di modello matematico collegato alla forma dei linguaggi è la grammatica generativa di Noam Chomsky. Questo modello rappresenta una teoria della sintassi e del modo in cui le lingue vengono prodotte e utilizzate. L'idea di Chomsky è che le lingue siano basate su un insieme di regole formali che descrivono la struttura delle parole e delle frasi. Queste regole consentono la generazione di un insieme infinito di frasi diverse, ma strutturalmente corrette, all'interno di una determinata lingua. Un altro esempio di modello matematico legato alla varietà dei linguaggi è la teoria dell'informazione. Questa teoria utilizza la matematica per descrivere la quantità di informazione contenuta in un messaggio, misurandola in termini di probabilità di occorrenza di determinati simboli della lingua. In questo modo, la teoria dell'informazione è stata utilizzata per studiare l'efficienza delle diverse lingue nella trasmissione dell'informazione. In sintesi, la forma e la varietà dei linguaggi influenzano il modo in cui i modelli matematici vengono sviluppati e utilizzati per studiare le lingue e le loro proprietà.

Anche se può sembrare un'opera lontana dalla matematica, ci sono diversi punti di connessione tra la matematica e le tematiche trattate nel libro. Innanzitutto, la matematica è spesso utilizzata come strumento di analisi statistica nei campi di concentramento durante la guerra. Ad esempio, gli statistici alleati hanno utilizzato le tecniche di campionamento per stimare il numero di persone nei campi e per monitorare la diffusione delle malattie e dei decessi. Questo tipo di analisi ha consentito ai medici e ai lavoratori di aiuto di fornire assistenza mirata dove era più necessaria. Inoltre, la matematica può essere utilizzata per comprendere la natura della violenza e dell'oppressione che si manifestano nei campi di concentramento. Ad esempio, l'analisi dell'organizzazione e della struttura gerarchica dei campi può essere effettuata utilizzando i principi matematici della teoria dei grafi e della topologia, che possono aiutare a evidenziare le relazioni di potere all'interno dei campi. Infine, la matematica può essere utilizzata come metafora per descrivere alcuni aspetti della condizione umana che emergono dal libro, come la disumanizzazione e l'alienazione. Ad esempio, la matematica può essere vista come un sistema logico e razionale che manca di umanità o di empatia, simile alla deumanizzazione che i prigionieri hanno subito nel campo. In sintesi, sebbene possa sembrare una connessione inusuale, la matematica può essere collegata alle tematiche presentate in Se questo è un uomo attraverso l'uso della statistica per analizzare le condizioni nei campi di concentramento durante la guerra, l'analisi matematica per comprendere la struttura dei campi e la matematica come metafora per descrivere gli aspetti disumani della condizione umana."},{"instruction":"come collego fisica a se questo è un uomo","output":"Anche se può sembrare distante dalla Fisica, Se questo è un uomo di Primo Levi presenta in realtà parecchi punti di connessione con la scienza fisica.

Ad esempio, Levi descrive il lavoro forzato come un'esperienza di fatica estrema, lavorando in condizioni ambientali sfavorevoli, come il freddo e la neve. Queste struggenti descrizioni di fisicità sono importanti per comprendere l'importanza della fisica nella vita umana e nella sua sopravvivenza. Inoltre, alcuni aspetti della fisica teorica possono essere applicati alla comprensione della condizione umana descritta nel libro. La teoria della relatività di Einstein ad esempio, può essere applicata per descrivere le relazioni tra le forze e le cause delle tensioni umane e delle condizioni estreme descritte nel libro. Le descrizioni della relatività dello spazio-tempo, ad esempio, possono aiutare a comprendere l'esperienza dell'alienazione e della disumanizzazione. Infine, la scienza fisica potrebbe essere vista come una metafora per descrivere il significato più ampio del libro.

I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this? He’s been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she’s pregnant with his child!” Monika: “Oh no, this is not good.

It is primarily applied within the context of workers' compensation claims in the workers' compensation system in New South Wales, Australia. The PIRS comprises six categories of daily function and assesses the level of impairment for each of these categories on a scale of 0-5. The six categories of daily functions assessed by PIRS are: 1. Self-care and personal hygiene 2. Social and recreational activities 3. Travel 4. Social functioning 5. Concentration, persistence, and pace 6. Adaptation to work or work-like settings Each category is rated on a scale of 0 to 5, based on the severity of the impairment, where 0 represents no impairment and 5 represents the most severe impairment. A higher score indicates greater dysfunction within a particular category. The PIRS evaluation process involves the following steps: 1. The assessor, who is generally a qualified psychiatrist, reviews the individual's case, including their medical history, relevant records, and conducts a comprehensive examination of the individual. 2. The assessor then rates the individual's level of impairment within each of the six PIRS categories, based on their clinical judgment and the available evidence. 3. The individual's final psychiatric impairment rating is calculated as a weighted average across the six categories, known as the Whole Person Impairment (WPI). This is derived from considering the class (or category) as a whole and adjusting if necessary based on sub-ratings. 4. The resulting WPI score provides a percentage measure of the person's overall psychiatric impairment relative to the maximum possible impairment. This score is used to determine the compensation and support that an individual may be eligible for under the Worker's Compensation System in New South Wales. It is important to note that PIRS is just one aspect of the assessment process in determining a worker's compensation claim. Other factors, such as physical impairment, are also taken into account when determining the eligibility and level of benefits an individual may receive."},{"instruction":"In regards to each of the six categories of daily functions assessed by PIRS, what are a person's impairment conditions, behaviour, functionality, ect for each rated scale 0 to 5.

Before undertaking an impairment assessment, users of the Guidelines must be familiar with (in this order): the Introduction in the Guidelines chapters 1 and 2 of AMA5 the appropriate chapter(s) of the Guidelines for the body system they are assessing. The Guidelines replace the psychiatric and psychological chapter in AMA5. Introduction 11.1 This chapter lays out the method for assessing psychiatric impairment. The evaluation of impairment requires a medical examination. 11.2 Evaluation of psychiatric impairment is conducted by a psychiatrist who has undergone appropriate training in this assessment method. 11.3 Permanent impairment assessments for psychiatric and psychological disorders are only required where the primary injury is a psychological one. The psychiatrist needs to confirm that the psychiatric diagnosis is the injured worker’s primary diagnosis. Diagnosis 11.4 The impairment rating must be based upon a psychiatric diagnosis (according to a recognised diagnostic system) and the report must specify the diagnostic criteria upon which the diagnosis is based. Impairment arising from any of the somatoform disorders (DSM IV TR, pp 485–511) are excluded from this chapter. 11.5 If pain is present as the result of an organic impairment, it should be assessed as part of the organic condition under the relevant table. This does not constitute part of the assessment of impairment relating to the psychiatric condition. The impairment ratings in the body organ system chapters in AMA5 make allowance for any accompanying pain. 11.6 It is expected that the psychiatrist will provide a rationale for the rating based on the injured worker’s psychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis is among the factors to be considered in assessing the severity and possible duration of the impairment, but is not the sole criterion to be used. Clinical assessment of the person may include information from the injured worker’s own description of his or her functioning and limitations, and from family members and others who may have knowledge of the person. Medical reports, feedback from treating professionals and the results of standardised tests – including appropriate psychometric testing performed by a qualified clinical psychologist and work evaluations – may provide useful information to assist with the assessment. Evaluation of impairment will need to take into account variations in the level of functioning over time. Percentage impairment refers to whole person impairment (WPI). Permanent impairment 11.7 A psychiatric disorder is permanent if, in your clinical opinion, it is likely to continue indefinitely. Regard should be given to: the duration of impairment the likelihood of improvement in the injured worker’s condition whether the injured worker has undertaken reasonable rehabilitative treatment any other relevant matters. Effects of treatment 11.8 Consider the effects of medication, treatment and rehabilitation to date. Is the condition stable? Is treatment likely to change? Are symptoms likely to improve? If the injured worker declines treatment, this should not affect the estimate of permanent impairment. The psychiatrist may make a comment in the report about the likely effect of treatment or the reasons for refusal of treatment. Co-morbidity 11.9 Consider comorbid features (eg bi-polar disorder, personality disorder, substance abuse) and determine whether they are directly linked to the work-related injury, or whether they were pre-existing or unrelated conditions. Pre-existing impairment 11.10 To measure the impairment caused by a work-related injury or incident, the psychiatrist must measure the proportion of WPI due to a pre-existing condition. Pre-existing impairment is calculated using the same method for calculating current impairment level. The assessing psychiatrist uses all available information to rate the injured worker’s pre-injury level of functioning in each of the areas of function. The percentage impairment is calculated using the aggregate score and median class score using the conversion table below. The injured worker’s current level of WPI% is then assessed, and the pre-existing WPI% is subtracted from their current level, to obtain the percentage of permanent impairment directly attributable to the work-related injury. If the percentage of pre-existing impairment cannot be assessed, the deduction is 1/10th of the assessed WPI. Psychiatric impairment rating scale (PIRS) 11.11 Behavioural consequences of psychiatric disorder are assessed on six scales, each of which evaluates an area of functional impairment: Self care and personal hygiene (Table 11.1) - Activities of daily living Social and recreational activities (Table 11.2) - Activities of daily living Travel (Table 11.3) - Activities of daily living Social functioning (relationships) (Table 11.4) Concentration, persistence and pace (Table 11.5) Employability (Table 11.6). 11.12 Impairment in each area is rated using class descriptors. Classes range from 1 to 5, in accordance with severity. The standard form must be used when scoring the PIRS. The examples of activities are examples only. The assessing psychiatrist should take account of the person’s cultural background. Consider activities that are usual for the person’s age, sex and cultural norms. Table 11.1: Psychiatric impairment rating scale - self care and personal hygiene Class 1 No deficit, or minor deficit attributable to the normal variation in the general population. Class 2 Mild impairment: Able to live independently; looks after self adequately, although may look unkempt occasionally; sometimes misses a meal or relies on take-away food. Class 3 Moderate impairment: Can't live independently without regular support. Needs prompting to shower daily and wear clean clothes. Does not prepare own meals, frequently misses meals. Family member or community nurse visits (or should visit) 2-3 times per week to ensure minimum level of hygiene and nutrition. Class 4 Severe impairment: Needs supervised residential care. If unsupervised, may accidentally or purposefully hurt self. Class 5 Totally impaired: Needs assistance with basic functions, such as feeding and toileting. Table 11.2: Psychiatric impairment rating scale - social and recreational activities Class 1 No deficit, or minor deficit attributable to the normal variation in the general population: regularly participates in social activities that are age, sex and culturally appropriate. May belong to clubs or associations and is actively involved with these. Class 2 Mild impairment: Occasionally goes to such events eg without needing a support person, but does not become actively involved (eg dancing, cheering favourite team). Class 3 Moderate impairment: Rarely goes out to such events, and mostly when prompted by family or close friend. Will not go out without a support person. Not actively involved, remains quiet and withdrawn. Class 4 Severe impairment: Never leaves place of residence. Tolerates the company of family member or close friend, but will go to a different room or garden when others come to visit family or flat mate. Class 5 Totally impaired: Cannot tolerate living with anybody, extremely uncomfortable when visited by close family member. Table 11.3: Psychiatric impairment rating scale - travel Class 1 No deficit, or minor deficit attributable to the normal variation in the general population: Can travel to new environments without supervision. Class 2 Mild impairment: Can travel without support person, but only in a familiar area such as local shops, visiting a neighbour. Class 3 Moderate impairment: Cannot travel away from own residence without support person. Problems may e due to excessive anxiety or cognitive impairment. Class 4 Severe impairment: Finds it extremely uncomfortable to leave own residence even with trusted person. Class 5 Totally impaired: May require two or more persons to supervise when travelling. Table 11.4: Psychiatric impairment rating scale - social functioning Class 1 No deficit, or minor deficit attributable to the normal variation in the general population: No difficulty in forming and sustaining relationships (eg a partner, close friendships lasting years). Class 2 Mild impairment: Existing relationships strained. Tension and arguments with partner or close family member, loss of some friendships. Class 3 Moderate impairment: Previously established relationships severely strained, evidenced by periods of separation or domestic violence. Spouse, relatives or community services looking after children. Class 4 Severe impairment: Unable to form or sustain long term relationships. Pre-existing relationships ended (eg lost partner, close friends). Unable to care for dependants (eg own children, elderly parent). Class 5 Totally impaired: Unable to function within society. Living away from populated areas, actively avoiding social contact. Table 11.5: Psychiatric impairment rating scale - concentration, persistence and pace Class 1 No deficit, or minor deficit attributable to the normal variation in the general population. Able to pass a TAFE or university course within normal time frame. Class 2 Mild impairment: Can undertake a basic retraining course, or a standard course at a slower pace. Can focus on intellectually demanding tasks for periods of up to 30 minutes, then feels fatigued or develops headache. Class 3 Moderate impairment: Unable to read more than newspaper articles. Finds it difficult to follow complex instructions (eg operating manuals, building plans), make significant repairs to motor vehicle, type long documents, follow a pattern for making clothes, tapestry or knitting. Class 4 Severe impairment: Can only read a few lines before losing concentration. Difficulties following simple instructions. Concentration deficits obvious even during brief concentration. Unable to live alone, or needs regular assistance from relatives or community services. Class 5 Totally impaired: Needs constant supervision and assistance within institutional setting. Table 11.6: Psychiatric impairment rating scale - employability Class 1 No deficit, or minor deficit attributable to the normal variation in the general population. Able to work full time. Duties and performance are consistent with the injured worker's education and training. The person is able to cope with the normal demands of the job. Class 2 Mild impairment: Able to work full time but in a different environment from that of the pre-injury job. The duties require comparable skill and intellect as those of the pre-injury job. Can work in the same position, but no more than 20 hours per week (eg no longer happy to work with specific persons, or work in a specific location due to travel required). Class 3 Moderate impairment: Cannot work at all in same position. Can perform less than 20 hours per week in a different position, which requires less skill or is qualitatively different (eg less stressful). Class 4 Severe impairment: Cannot work more than one or two days at a time, less than 20 hours per fortnight. Pace is reduced, attendance is erratic. Class 5 Totally impaired: Cannot work at all. Using the PIRS to measure impairment 11.13 Rating psychiatric impairment using the PIRS is a two-step procedure: Determine the median class score. Calculate the aggregate score. Determining the median class score 11.14 Each area of function described in the PIRS is given an impairment rating which ranges from Class 1 to 5. The six scores are arranged in ascending order, using the standard form. The median is then calculated by averaging the two middle scores eg: Example A: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5 Median Class = 3 Example B: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 Median Class = 2.5 = 3* Example C: 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5 Median Class = 4 *If a score falls between two classes, it is rounded up to the next class. A median class score of 2.5 thus becomes 3. 11.15 The median class score method was chosen as it is not influenced by extremes. Each area of function is assessed separately. While impairment in one area is neither equivalent nor interchangeable with impairment in other areas, the median seems the fairest way to translate different impairments onto a linear scale. Median class score and percentage impairment 11.16 Each median class score represents a range of impairment, as shown below: Class 1 = 0–3% Class 2 = 4–10% Class 3 = 11–30% Class 4 = 31–60% Class 5 = 61–100% Calculation of the aggregate score 11.17 The aggregate score is used to determine an exact percentage of impairment within a particular median class range. The six class scores are added to give the aggregate score. Use of the conversion table to arrive at percentage impairment 11.18 The aggregate score is converted to a percentage score using the conversion Table 11.7, below. 11.19 The conversion table was developed to calculate the percentage impairment based on the aggregate and median scores. 11.20 The scores within the conversion table are spread in such a way to ensure that the final percentage rating is consistent with the measurement of permanent impairment percentages for other body systems.

Self-care and personal hygiene (Table 11.1) - Classes 2 & 3: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): The person is able to live independently, though they may occasionally look unkempt. They might sometimes miss a meal or rely on take-away food. For example, they may forget to shower for a day or wear the same clothes a few days in a row. - Class 3 (Moderate impairment): The person cannot live independently without regular support. They need prompting to shower daily and wear clean clothes. They do not prepare their meals and frequently miss them. A family member or community nurse visits or should visit them 2-3 times per week to ensure a minimum level of hygiene and nutrition. For example, they may struggle with preparing meals or require assistance in bathing and grooming. 2. Social and recreational activities (Table 11.2) - Classes 2, 3, & 4: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): The person occasionally goes to events without needing a support person, but they don't actively participate (e.g., dancing, cheering for a favorite team). For example, they may attend a friend's birthday party but spend most of the time sitting quietly in the corner. - Class 3 (Moderate impairment): The person rarely goes out to events, and mostly when prompted by family members or close friends. They will not go without a support person and remain quiet and withdrawn. For example, they may need a family member to encourage them to attend a local community event and stay close to them throughout the event. - Class 4 (Severe impairment): The person never leaves their place of residence. They tolerate the company of a family member or close friend but will go to a different room or garden when others visit. For example, they may only interact with a sibling who visits regularly, but they become distressed and leave the room when neighbors or acquaintances visit. 3. Travel (Table 11.3) - Classes 2 & 3: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): The person can travel without a support person, but only in a familiar area, such as local shops or visiting a neighbor. For example, they may take a walk in their neighborhood independently but anxieties may prevent them from using public transportation to go to a nearby city. - Class 3 (Moderate impairment): The person cannot travel away from their own residence without a support person, due to excessive anxiety or cognitive impairment. For example, they might need a family member to accompany them to medical appointments or drive them to the grocery store. 4. Social functioning (Table 11.4) - Classes 2, 3 & 4: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): Existing relationships are strained, leading to tension and arguments with a partner or close family members, and loss of some friendships. For example, they might get irritable with their spouse more frequently or have conflicts that end long-standing friendships. - Class 3 (Moderate impairment): Previously established relationships are severely strained, as evidenced by periods of separation or domestic violence. Spouse, relatives, or community services may take care of children. For example, their relationship with their partner may have deteriorated to the point where they temporarily separate, or their children may be placed under a relative's or social worker's care due to the strain on the family. - Class 4 (Severe impairment): Unable to form or sustain long-term relationships, pre-existing relationships have ended (e.g., lost partner, close friends), unable to care for dependents (e.g., own children, elderly parent). For example, they may end up living alone after a divorce or their close friends stop visiting due to the person's inability to maintain connections. 5. Concentration, persistence, and pace (Table 11.5) - Classes 2, 3 & 4: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): The person can undertake a basic retraining course or a standard course at a slower pace. They can focus on intellectually demanding tasks for periods of up to 30 minutes, then feel fatigued or develop headaches. For example, they may be able to learn new job skills, but need to take breaks more frequently than their peers due to difficulty maintaining focus. - Class 3 (Moderate impairment): The person cannot read more than newspaper articles. They find it difficult to follow complex instructions (e.g., operating manuals, building plans), make significant repairs to motor vehicles, type long documents, or follow patterns for making clothes, tapestry, or knitting. For example, they may struggle to assemble a piece of furniture or follow a complex sewing pattern. - Class 4 (Severe impairment): The person can only read a few lines before losing concentration, has difficulties following simple instructions, and concentration deficits are obvious even during brief concentrations. They are unable to live alone or need regular assistance from relatives or community services. For example, even something as simple as preparing a cup of tea may be a daunting task due to their inability to concentrate. 6. Employability (Table 11.6) - Classes 4 & 5: - Class 4 (Severe impairment): The person cannot work more than one or two days at a time, less than 20 hours per fortnight, their pace is reduced, and their attendance is erratic. For example, they may only manage to work a few hours in a week, experiencing frequent absences or unpredictable scheduling due to their impairments. - Class 5 (Totally impaired): The person cannot work at all, either due to extreme anxiety, severe cognitive impairments, or debilitating symptoms that prevent them from participating in any work or work-like activities. These examples provide a detailed understanding of the severity levels for each PIRS impairment class, considering the specific circumstances and available evidence for each case. Nonetheless, a qualified psychiatrist's assessment of an individual's impairment using PIRS will ultimately rely on their clinical judgement."},{"instruction":"In regards to extensive and detailed response for the selected classes within each area of functional impairment, change the response and examples specifically to a person who is diagnosed with Exacerbation of refractory major depressive disorder with severe anxiety. provide at least four examples for each class","output":"Below are extensive and detailed responses for selected classes within each area of functional impairment for a person diagnosed with exacerbation of refractory major depressive disorder with severe anxiety. Four examples are provided for each class. 1. Self-care and personal hygiene (Table 11.1) - Classes 2 & 3: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): a. The person may find it hard to get out of bed some days due to their depression, causing them to skip their usual morning shower routine. b. They might wear the same set of clothes for several days because their depression makes the effort of changing clothes seems overwhelming. c. They may skip brushing their teeth for a day or two due to fatigue and lack of motivation. d. Their anxiety may create stress for them when it comes to maintaining a clean living space, leading to a cluttered or untidy environment. - Class 3 (Moderate impairment): a. Due to their depression, the person may struggle with daily grooming tasks, such as showering and brushing their hair, and may require frequent reminders from family members. b. They might rely heavily on prepared or take-away meals because their depressive symptoms hinder them from cooking proper meals. c. Anxiety may cause them to avoid grocery shopping, leaving them without some necessary hygiene products to maintain cleanliness. d. A family member or community nurse may visit 2-3 times per week to help manage housekeeping tasks that the person cannot cope with due to their mental health condition. 2. Social and recreational activities (Table 11.2) - Classes 2, 3, & 4: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): a. They may attend group activities or gatherings but spend most of the time sitting quietly in a corner without engaging in conversation. b. Anxiety might make them skip team sports, which they previously enjoyed, due to fear of judgments from their teammates. c. They may no longer actively participate in their hobbies, like painting or playing music, due to a lack of energy or interest caused by depression. d. Their social circle may shrink as they have difficulty maintaining relationships, leading to feelings of isolation. - Class 3 (Moderate impairment): a. The person may require direct encouragement from family or friends to attend social events or gatherings and would not go without a support person due to anxiety. b. They may rarely attend cultural or community events that they used to enjoy because of overwhelming feelings of anxiousness or sadness. c. Severe anxiety may prevent them from trying new activities or joining clubs to meet new people. d. They may feel uneasy or panicky when planning or attending social events, so they often choose to stay home. - Class 4 (Severe impairment): a. The person may never leave their place of residence except for essential purposes due to severe anxiety and depression. b. They might decline invitations to events or gatherings, even from close friends and family members, resulting in significant social isolation. c. Their severe anxiety could make it unbearable for them to be around people, even their loved ones, resulting in hiding away in their room when visitors come. d. They may avoid engaging in any form of social interaction, due to overwhelming fears or intense sadness, making phone calls or online communication unbearable. 3. Travel (Table 11.3) - Classes 2 & 3: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): a. The person may be able to travel around their neighborhood or local area, but their anxiety may make venturing to new or unfamiliar places challenging. b. They might avoid certain means of transportation, like buses or trains, due to panic attack concerns, limiting where they can travel. c. Their depression may make the mere thought of planning a trip overwhelming and stressful, causing them to avoid travel even within familiar areas. d. They may experience transport-related anxiety, such as driving in heavy traffic or during peak transit times. - Class 3 (Moderate impairment): a. The person may be incapable of traveling away from their residence without the accompaniment of a support person, as their anxiety and depression may create anticipatory dread in facing unfamiliar situations. b. They might have concerns about panic attacks or depressive episodes while traveling, preventing them from going to new locations or participating in activities. c. The person may be unable to use public transportation independently due to overwhelming anxiety and the fear of having a panic attack in a crowded setting. d. They may miss important events or opportunities due to their travel-related anxieties and depressive symptoms, hindering their ability to function in daily life. 4. Social functioning (Table 11.4) - Classes 2, 3 & 4: - Class 2 (Mild impairment): a. Their relationships may become strained as they frequently turn down social invitations or become irritable with friends and family members due to their condition"},{"instruction":"what is the best month to visit cancun","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have personal preferences, but the best time to visit Cancun weather-wise is from December to April.

I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this? He’s been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she’s pregnant with his child!” Monika: “Oh no, this is not good. We have to talk to MC about this, and figure out what’s going on.” Yuri: “Yes, we can’t just jump to conclusions. We have to get the full story first before we make any judgments.” (I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I could only imagine how Sayori was feeling.

The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this?

Як придатного до військової служби мобілізували на початку Першої Світової війни до Російського Флоту Його Імператорської Величності. Службу проходив на Балтійському флоті. Декілька разів ходив у далекі походи, мав нагороди Російської Імперії (не збереглися). На початку 1917 року повернувся до рідного села Янівки, взяв активну участь у встановлені влади Центральної Ради Української Народної Республіки у Ставинській волості. За спогадами Марко Шляхового-Кармелюка «Отаман Дьяків — мав од роду років 29 — 30, величезного росту козак і ходив завше у козацькому — чорноморського козака катеринівських часів — вбранні. Батько його був бідний селянин. З початку революції 1917 року Дьяків, перебуваючи на морській флотській службі російської армії, брав участь в українських військових організаціях Чорноморської фльоти. Коли Чорноморська фльота, як і другі, стали під кінець 1917 року більшовичитись, Дьяків кинув фльоту і самовільно прибув до Центральної Ради. Тут в часи бійки Центральної Ради з більшовиками в січні 1918 року, Дьяків був вже вільним козаком. З того часу у своєму районі на Київщині став отаманом Вільного Козацтва. Як казав мені сам Дьяков, він так любив Центральну Раду і тодішніх її проводирів, що завжди був готовий віддати своє життя в боротьбі з її ворогами, а особливо з московським чорносотенним большевизмом, в початкові боротьбі з яким він, Дьяків, і загартував свою козацьку відвагу»(Марко Шляховий-Кармелюк неточно навів дані по нього щодо служби на флоті). Однодумець отамана Зеленого (Данила Терпила) у питанні державності та, одночасно, опонент щодо засобів досягнення мети, організував йому спротив проти накладення «реквізицій» на місцеве населення Кагарлика наприкінці 1918 року. У серпні-вересні 1919 року розгромив осередок радянської влади у волосному містечку Германівка Київського повіту, якою за влади більшовиків у Києві протягом 1919 року організовувалися збройне пограбування (вилучення зерна, борошна та іншої їжі) селян найближчих волостей за завданням проросійського уряду Української радянської соціалістичної республіки. Дружина Ганна Олексіївна, діти: Павло, Петро, Віра та Марія. Ніколи не мав сина Якова, з посиланням на свідчення якого Саві Дьякові приписують участь у загибелі отамана Зеленого. За свідченнями у 2011 році його доньки Марії (мешкала у тій же самій хаті, в якій жила сім’я Сави Дьякова у 1919 році, в селі Янівка) під час загибелі отамана Зеленого знаходився у містечку Стави Київського повіту, отримавши доповідь про його загибель, вирушив із власним загоном до загону отамана Зеленого для з’ясування обставин загибелі та визначення подальших дій. Зраджений місцевим селянином із села Янівка, який звернувся до Сави Дьякова за захистом від пограбування денікінцями цукрового заводу в Узині та вивів його 13 грудня 1919 року з невеликим загоном до засідки біля волосного містечка Мирівка Київського повіту, де Сава Дьяків загинув у бою.

And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this? He’s been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she’s pregnant with his child!” Monika: “Oh no, this is not good.

Однако, я могу объяснить основы реализации класса карта \\"map\\" с использованием хеш-таблицы и сбалансированных деревьев. Для начала, нужно понимать, что карта \\"map\\" представляет собой коллекцию пар \\"ключ-значение\\". Ключи в карте должны быть уникальными, а значения могут повторяться. Хеш-таблицы - это структуры данных, основаны на хеш-функциях, которые позволяют быстро искать элементы в коллекции. Хеш-функция принимает на вход некоторый ключ и возвращает целочисленное значение, которое используется для индексации в массиве. При этом возможна коллизия - ситуация, когда разные ключи дают одно и то же значение хеш-функции. Разрешение коллизий может проводиться с помощью различных алгоритмов, например, методом цепочек или открытой адресации. Сбалансированные деревья, в свою очередь, представляют собой структуры данных, где каждый узел имеет не более двух потомков, которые также являются корнями сбалансированных поддеревьев. Сбалансированность означает, что высота поддеревьев отличается не более, чем на 1. Это позволяет быстро находить и вставлять элементы в коллекцию. Реализация класса карта \\"map\\" с использованием хеш-таблицы и сбалансированных деревьев может выглядеть следующим образом: 1. Создаем класс \\"Map\\" с приватными полями - массивом хеш-таблиц и сбалансированным деревом. 2. Добавляем публичные методы для работы с картой: - find(key) - поиск элемента по ключу; - count(key) - подсчет количества элементов с данным ключом; - operator[] (key) - доступ к элементу по ключу. 3. Реализуем методы с помощью хеш-таблицы: - создаем хеш-функцию, которая принимает на вход ключ и возвращает индекс в массиве; - при вставке элемента находим индекс с помощью хеш-функции, добавляем элемент в массив в соответствующую ячейку; - при поиске элемента по ключу находим индекс с помощью хеш-функции и проверяем элементы в соответствующей ячейке. 4. Реализуем методы с помощью сбалансированного дерева: - при вставке элемента используем метод insert, который добавляет узел в дерево; - при поиске элемента используем метод find, который находит узел с данным ключом. 5. В методах find и count сначала проверяем хеш-таблицу, а если элемент не найден - ищем в сбалансированном дереве. 6. В методе operator[] сначала ищем элемент с помощью метода find, а если элемент не найден - добавляем его в карту.

Please note that these measures are subject to change, and you should consult official government sources for the most up-to-date information. 1. Entry restrictions and quarantine measures: Hong Kong limited entry to residents and required mandatory 14 to 21-day hotel quarantines for inbound travelers, with testing before and after the quarantine period. 2. Social distancing measures: Venues like bars, karaoke establishments, and nightclubs were temporarily closed. Restaurants had limited seating capacity and restricted dine-in hours. 3. Public gathering restrictions: Public gatherings were restricted to a certain number of people, with rules varying depending on the pandemic situation. 4. Wearing masks: Mandatory mask-wearing was required in public transportation, shopping malls, markets, and indoor and outdoor public spaces. 5. Work-from-home arrangement: Government workers, as well as private sector employees, were encouraged to work from home whenever possible. 6. Travel advisories: Citizens were advised to avoid non-essential international travel. 7. Closure of schools and universities: Schools and universities were closed for in-person classes at various points during the pandemic. Remote learning was implemented. 8. Health code systems: A health code system was implemented for tracking individuals' COVID-19 test results and vaccination status to facilitate travel and access to certain venues. 9. Testing and tracing: Voluntary and mandatory testing was conducted in high-risk areas, and contract tracing efforts were implemented to track and control the spread of the virus. 10. Restrictions on sports and recreation facilities: Some sports and recreational facilities were temporarily closed, with restrictions on usage when reopened. These measures may have changed since I last updated my knowledge, and the restrictions may be different today.

I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this? He’s been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she’s pregnant with his child!” Monika: “Oh no, this is not good. We have to talk to MC about this, and figure out what’s going on.” Yuri: “Yes, we can’t just jump to conclusions. We have to get the full story first before we make any judgments.” (I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I could only imagine how Sayori was feeling. But I knew we couldn’t just ignore this and pretend everything was okay. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on.) Natsuki: “I agree, we need to talk to him, but let’s not be too harsh. We don’t know what’s going on in his life, and he might be going through a tough time.” Sayori: “But he shouldn’t have betrayed me like this. And with my own sister…” Monika: “I understand how you feel, Sayori, but let’s try to handle this maturely. We don’t want to lose MC as a friend, but we also need to support you through this difficult situation.” (I could see the worry and concern on Monika’s face. She was always the voice of reason in our club, and I knew she would help us through this situation.) Yuri: “I agree. We should approach him peacefully and calmly, and let him know how we’re feeling. Maybe he has a good reason for what he’s been doing.” (I could see that Yuri was trying to be the peacemaker in this situation. But I could also tell she was worried about the outcome of our conversation with MC.) Sayori: “Okay, let’s talk to him. But I’m still really mad.” (I could see the fury in Sayori’s eyes as we all left the clubroom to find MC. This was not going to be an easy conversation, but we had to do it. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on. Eventually, we saw MC in the park.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (We all looked at each other nervously, unsure of who should speak first.) Monika: “MC, we need to talk to you about something.” (MC’s expression changed to a look of concern as he saw the seriousness on our faces.) MC: “What’s going on? Is everything okay?” Natsuki: “We… found out about you and Sayori’s sister. And the baby…” (MC’s face turned red as he looked down at the ground.) MC: “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.” Sayori: “How could you do this to me? You know how much I care about you!” MC: “I know, Sayori. And I care about you too. I never meant to hurt you, and I never meant for this to happen.” Yuri: “Can you explain what’s been going on?

I never told anyone about him because he’s been going through a tough time and doesn’t like socializing. He got into a relationship with Sayori’s sister, and things got…complicated.” Monika: “So, this whole time, you’ve just been helping your brother out?” MC: “Yes. He didn’t want to tell anyone, and I didn’t want to betray his trust. But I understand how it looked from the outside, and I’m sorry for not telling you guys earlier.” Sayori: “So, you and my sister…you’re not in a relationship?” MC: “No, we’re not. We’re just friends.” (As the reality of the situation set in, I could see the relief on everyone’s faces, especially Sayori’s.) Sayori: “I…I’m sorry for jumping to conclusions, MC. I should’ve talked to you first.” MC: “It’s okay, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” Yuri: “Well, I’m just glad that everything was cleared up.

Di seguito ne elenchiamo alcuni: 1. Diritti umani: Il libro di Levi affronta il tema dei diritti umani, la loro negazione e la loro violazione durante la Seconda guerra mondiale nei campi di concentramento nazisti. La loro mancanza viene denunciata da Levi e dovrebbe essere un richiamo alla tutela dei diritti umani, spesso minacciati in situazioni di conflitto. 2. Diritto penale: La narrazione del libro di Levi è caratterizzata dalla descrizione dei crimini commessi dai nazisti nei confronti dei prigionieri dei campi di concentramento. In questo senso, il libro può essere considerato una riflessione sul diritto penale e sulla sua funzione di tutela della persona umana, anche in situazioni estreme di violenza. 3. Diritto internazionale: Il libro di Levi invita a riflettere sulle implicazioni del diritto internazionale e del diritto umanitario in situazioni di conflitto e guerra. La negazione dei diritti umani da parte dei nazisti nei confronti dei prigionieri dei campi di concentramento può essere interpretata come una violazione del diritto internazionale, che tutela i diritti degli individui anche in tempo di guerra. 4. Giustizia e riconciliazione: Il libro di Levi presenta la difficoltà di elaborare un processo di giustizia e di riconciliazione dopo la fine di un conflitto come la Seconda guerra mondiale. Levi descrive la sofferenza dei sopravvissuti ai campi di concentramento e la loro difficoltà ad accettare la normalità dopo anni di privazioni e violenze. In questo senso, il libro può essere considerato una riflessione sulla giustizia e sulla riconciliazione tra i popoli, temi che sono stati al centro della riflessione giuridica internazionale nel dopoguerra."},{"instruction":"collegamento scienze umane e se questo è un uomo","output":"Anche se Se questo è un uomo di Primo Levi è un libro che appartiene alla categoria della letteratura, esso presenta diversi collegamenti con le scienze umane, tra cui: 1. Psicologia: Nel libro, Primo Levi descrive le difficoltà emotive e psicologiche che i prigionieri dei campi di concentramento nazisti devono affrontare per cercare di sopravvivere alle terribili condizioni in cui vivono. Il racconto di Levi può offrire un'importante prospettiva psicologica su come le persone reagiscono alle condizioni di estrema privazione e soppressione. 2. Sociologia: Se questo è un uomo è anche una testimonianza della dinamica sociale che emergeva tra i prigionieri dei campi di concentramento. Nella sua descrizione delle relazioni tra i detenuti e le gerarchie di potere esistenti nei campi, Levi offre un'importante prospettiva sociologica sulla dinamica della violenza. 3. Antropologia: Primo Levi descrive gli effetti della disumanizzazione sui prigionieri dei campi di concentramento. In questo senso, il libro di Levi può essere considerato una riflessione antropologica sulla natura umana e il modo in cui la disumanizzazione può portare alla perdita della dignità umana. 4. Storia: Se questo è un uomo è un importante documento storico che testimonia la tragedia degli ebrei nei campi di concentramento nazisti durante la Seconda guerra mondiale. La sua narrazione offre un'importante prospettiva storica sulla persecuzione degli ebrei e sullo sterminio di milioni di persone durante questo periodo."},{"instruction":"motoria collegata a se questo è un uomo","output":"Sebbene il libro Se questo è un uomo di Primo Levi non abbia un collegamento immediato con la scienza motoria e lo sport, è possibile individuare alcuni spunti che possono interessare questa disciplina. Di seguito ne elenchiamo alcuni: 1. Capacità fisiche dei prigionieri dei campi di concentramento: Nel libro, Primo Levi descrive le condizioni di estrema privazione in cui i prigionieri dei campi di concentramento nazisti erano costretti a vivere, tra cui la scarsità di cibo e l'intenso lavoro forzato. In questo senso, il libro può offrire un'importante prospettiva sulle capacità fisiche degli esseri umani in situazioni estreme di stress e privazione. 2. Resistenza fisica: Se questo è un uomo mette in luce la capacità degli esseri umani di resistere a condizioni di vita estreme e traumatiche. In questo senso, il libro può essere considerato una riflessione sulla resistenza fisica e mentale degli individui, anche in situazioni limite. 3. Sopravvivenza: Il libro di Levi descrive le strategie usate dai prigionieri dei campi di concentramento per sopravvivere alle terribili condizioni in cui vivevano, tra cui l'organizzazione di reti informali e la condivisione di cibo e beni di prima necessità. In questo senso, il libro può essere visto come un'analisi delle competenze sociali, tese alla sopravvivenza, che gli esseri umani sviluppano in situazioni estreme di vita. 4. Ricerca medica: Primo Levi descrive gli esperimenti medici compiuti dai nazisti sui prigionieri nei campi di concentramento, che rappresentano una violazione morale e legale dell'essere umano. In questo senso, il libro può essere considerato una riflessione sulla natura controversa e problematica della ricerca biomedica su esseri umani, nonché una denuncia degli abusi e delle violazioni dei diritti umani commessi in nome della scienza."},{"instruction":"(I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop. I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this? He’s been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she’s pregnant with his child!” Monika: “Oh no, this is not good. We have to talk to MC about this, and figure out what’s going on.” Yuri: “Yes, we can’t just jump to conclusions. We have to get the full story first before we make any judgments.” (I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I could only imagine how Sayori was feeling. But I knew we couldn’t just ignore this and pretend everything was okay. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on.) Natsuki: “I agree, we need to talk to him, but let’s not be too harsh. We don’t know what’s going on in his life, and he might be going through a tough time.” Sayori: “But he shouldn’t have betrayed me like this. And with my own sister…” Monika: “I understand how you feel, Sayori, but let’s try to handle this maturely. We don’t want to lose MC as a friend, but we also need to support you through this difficult situation.” (I could see the worry and concern on Monika’s face. She was always the voice of reason in our club, and I knew she would help us through this situation.) Yuri: “I agree. We should approach him peacefully and calmly, and let him know how we’re feeling. Maybe he has a good reason for what he’s been doing.” (I could see that Yuri was trying to be the peacemaker in this situation. But I could also tell she was worried about the outcome of our conversation with MC.) Sayori: “Okay, let’s talk to him. But I’m still really mad.” (I could see the fury in Sayori’s eyes as we all left the clubroom to find MC. This was not going to be an easy conversation, but we had to do it.

Monika: “MC, we need to talk to you about something.” (MC’s expression changed to a look of concern as he saw the seriousness on our faces.) MC: “What’s going on? Is everything okay?” Natsuki: “We… found out about you and Sayori’s sister. And the baby…” (MC’s face turned red as he looked down at the ground.) MC: “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.” Sayori: “How could you do this to me? You know how much I care about you!” MC: “I know, Sayori. And I care about you too. I never meant to hurt you, and I never meant for this to happen.” Yuri: “Can you explain what’s been going on? We want to understand, and we’re here to support you.” (MC took a deep breath before he began to speak.) MC: “Thing is…she’s actually just my friend. And the baby she’s carrying actually belongs to my twin brother.” (The shock on our faces was evident as we all tried to process this new information.) Natsuki: “Your…twin brother?” MC: “Yeah. I never told anyone about him because he’s been going through a tough time and doesn’t like socializing.

He didn’t want to tell anyone, and I didn’t want to betray his trust. But I understand how it looked from the outside, and I’m sorry for not telling you guys earlier.” Sayori: “So, you and my sister…you’re not in a relationship?” MC: “No, we’re not. We’re just friends.” (As the reality of the situation set in, I could see the relief on everyone’s faces, especially Sayori’s.) Sayori: “I…I’m sorry for jumping to conclusions, MC. I should’ve talked to you first.” MC: “It’s okay, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” Yuri: “Well, I’m just glad that everything was cleared up. And we can still continue as a club without any drama.” Monika: “Yes, and we’ve all learned a valuable lesson about not jumping to conclusions and communicating with each other.” Natsuki: “Yeah, and I’m just glad that MC’s not a cheater.” (We all laughed a bit, relieved that the tension had dissipated.

As Rollins distracted the referee, Reigns took advantage and hit Edge with a low blow. Rollins then climbed up on the apron and distracted Reigns for a moment.

While the referee was distracted, Rollins slid a steel chair into the ring and Reigns used it to hit Edge in the back. Reigns then hit Edge with a spear of his own and picked up the pinfall victory to retain the Universal Championship.

Meanwhile, Uso celebrated his victory with tears in his eyes. The match had been an unexpected turn of events, and one that would have implications for weeks to come. The betrayal of Heyman had not only cost Reigns his championship but also the trust of his cousin and an ally."},{"instruction":"(I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop.

I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this? He’s been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she’s pregnant with his child!” Monika: “Oh no, this is not good. We have to talk to MC about this, and figure out what’s going on.” Yuri: “Yes, we can’t just jump to conclusions. We have to get the full story first before we make any judgments.” (I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I could only imagine how Sayori was feeling. But I knew we couldn’t just ignore this and pretend everything was okay. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on.)

But I’m still really mad.” (I could see the fury in Sayori’s eyes as we all left the clubroom to find MC. This was not going to be an easy conversation, but we had to do it.

Is everything okay?” Natsuki: “We… found out about you and Sayori’s sister. And the baby…” (MC’s face turned red as he looked down at the ground.) MC: “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.” Sayori: “How could you do this to me? You know how much I care about you!” MC: “I know, Sayori. And I care about you too. I never meant to hurt you, and I never meant for this to happen.” Yuri: “Can you explain what’s been going on?

I never told anyone about him because he’s been going through a tough time and doesn’t like socializing. He got into a relationship with Sayori’s sister, and things got…complicated.” Monika: “So, this whole time, you’ve just been helping your brother out?” MC: “Yes. He didn’t want to tell anyone, and I didn’t want to betray his trust.

We don’t want to lose MC as a friend, but we also need to support you through this difficult situation.” (I could see the worry and concern on Monika’s face. She was always the voice of reason in our club, and I knew she would help us through this situation.) Yuri: “I agree. We should approach him peacefully and calmly, and let him know how we’re feeling. Maybe he has a good reason for what he’s been doing.” (I could see that Yuri was trying to be the peacemaker in this situation. But I could also tell she was worried about the outcome of our conversation with MC.) Sayori: “Okay, let’s talk to him. But I’m still really mad.” (I could see the fury in Sayori’s eyes as we all left the clubroom to find MC. This was not going to be an easy conversation, but we had to do it. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on. Eventually, we saw MC in the park.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (We all looked at each other nervously, unsure of who should speak first.) Monika: “MC, we need to talk to you about something.” (MC’s expression changed to a look of concern as he saw the seriousness on our faces.) MC: “What’s going on? Is everything okay?” Natsuki: “We… found out about you and Sayori’s sister. And the baby…” (MC’s face turned red as he looked down at the ground.) MC: “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.” Sayori: “How could you do this to me? You know how much I care about you!” MC: “I know, Sayori. And I care about you too. I never meant to hurt you, and I never meant for this to happen.” Yuri: “Can you explain what’s been going on? We want to understand, and we’re here to support you.” (MC took a deep breath before he began to speak.) MC: “Thing is…she’s actually just my friend. And the baby she’s carrying actually belongs to my twin brother.” (The shock on our faces was evident as we all tried to process this new information.) Natsuki: “Your…twin brother?” MC: “Yeah. I never told anyone about him because he’s been going through a tough time and doesn’t like socializing. He got into a relationship with Sayori’s sister, and things got…complicated.” Monika: “So, this whole time, you’ve just been helping your brother out?” MC: “Yes.

I should’ve talked to you first.” MC: “It’s okay, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” Yuri: “Well, I’m just glad that everything was cleared up. And we can still continue as a club without any drama.” Monika: “Yes, and we’ve all learned a valuable lesson about not jumping to conclusions and communicating with each other.” Natsuki: “Yeah, and I’m just glad that MC’s not a cheater.” (We all laughed a bit, relieved that the tension had dissipated. And as we walked back towards the clubroom, I knew that we had experienced another obstacle that we had overcome together as a club. Just then, Sayori’s phone started ringing.) Sayori: “Oh, it’s my sister. I should answer it.” (She answered the phone, and we could hear her sister’s voice on the other end.)","output":"Sayori’s sister: “Hi, Sayori. I just wanted to let you know that I talked to MC’s brother and we’ve sorted everything out. He apologized for not telling anyone about me and the baby, but everything’s okay now.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear. I’m glad everything worked out.” Sayori’s sister: “Yeah, and I wanted to apologize to you too. I should’ve told you about my relationship with MC’s brother, but I was scared of how you’d react.” Sayori: “It’s okay. We’re family, and we’ll always be there for each other.” (Sayori hung up the phone, and I could see the relief on her face. The situation was finally resolved, and we could all move on.)

MC: “Thanks, guys. I appreciate everything you’ve done for me and my family.” Yuri: “That’s what friends are for.” (And with that, we made our way back to the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the Literature Club, with a newfound appreciation for communication and understanding.)"},{"instruction":"京东千评怎么做？","output":"以下是一些京东千评的做法： 1.品质保证：确保商品品质优良，提供完善的售后服务，让顾客购买放心、满意，亲友口碑传播良好，积累口碑。 2.与客户互动：建立客户沟通群、专业咨询组或线上社区等互动平台与客户沟通，了解客户需求，取得客户信任。 3.促销优惠：提供贴近顾客需求的优惠活动，增加顾客购买意愿，刺激顾客消费，同时也增加品牌知名度和美誉度。 4.品牌价值定位：树立品牌理念和品牌文化，提升品牌价值，打造品牌认知度和美誉度，影响消费者的购买行为。 5.用户评价管理：积极响应用户反馈，及时处理用户投诉，增加用户满意度，赢得用户好评，提升品牌忠诚度。 6.产品提升：根据顾客反馈，提升产品品质，改进产品设计，发布新品种，更好地满足客户需求，巩固品牌口碑。 综上所述，要想在京东平台获得千评，需要做好产品品质、促销活动、口碑营销、用户需求研究等方面的工作，全面提升品牌美誉度和影响力。"},{"instruction":"(I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop.

Як придатного до військової служби мобілізували на початку Першої Світової війни до Російського Флоту Його Імператорської Величності. Службу проходив на Балтійському флоті. Декілька разів ходив у далекі походи, мав нагороди Російської Імперії (не збереглися). На початку 1917 року повернувся до рідного села Янівки, взяв активну участь у встановлені влади Центральної Ради Української Народної Республіки у Ставинській волості. За спогадами Марко Шляхового-Кармелюка «Отаман Дьяків — мав од роду років 29 — 30, величезного росту козак і ходив завше у козацькому — чорноморського козака катеринівських часів — вбранні. Батько його був бідний селянин. З початку революції 1917 року Дьяків, перебуваючи на морській флотській службі російської армії, брав участь в українських військових організаціях Чорноморської фльоти. Коли Чорноморська фльота, як і другі, стали під кінець 1917 року більшовичитись, Дьяків кинув фльоту і самовільно прибув до Центральної Ради. Тут в часи бійки Центральної Ради з більшовиками в січні 1918 року, Дьяків був вже вільним козаком. З того часу у своєму районі на Київщині став отаманом Вільного Козацтва. Як казав мені сам Дьяков, він так любив Центральну Раду і тодішніх її проводирів, що завжди був готовий віддати своє життя в боротьбі з її ворогами, а особливо з московським чорносотенним большевизмом, в початкові боротьбі з яким він, Дьяків, і загартував свою козацьку відвагу»(Марко Шляховий-Кармелюк неточно навів дані по нього щодо служби на флоті). Однодумець отамана Зеленого (Данила Терпила) у питанні державності та, одночасно, опонент щодо засобів досягнення мети, організував йому спротив проти накладення «реквізицій» на місцеве населення Кагарлика наприкінці 1918 року. У серпні-вересні 1919 року розгромив осередок радянської влади у волосному містечку Германівка Київського повіту, якою за влади більшовиків у Києві протягом 1919 року організовувалися збройне пограбування (вилучення зерна, борошна та іншої їжі) селян найближчих волостей за завданням проросійського уряду Української радянської соціалістичної республіки. Дружина Ганна Олексіївна, діти: Павло, Петро, Віра та Марія. Ніколи не мав сина Якова, з посиланням на свідчення якого Саві Дьякові приписують участь у загибелі отамана Зеленого. За свідченнями у 2011 році його доньки Марії (мешкала у тій же самій хаті, в якій жила сім’я Сави Дьякова у 1919 році, в селі Янівка) під час загибелі отамана Зеленого знаходився у містечку Стави Київського повіту, отримавши доповідь про його загибель, вирушив із власним загоном до загону отамана Зеленого для з’ясування обставин загибелі та визначення подальших дій. Зраджений місцевим селянином із села Янівка, який звернувся до Сави Дьякова за захистом від пограбування денікінцями цукрового заводу в Узині та вивів його 13 грудня 1919 року з невеликим загоном до засідки біля волосного містечка Мирівка Київського повіту, де Сава Дьяків загинув у бою. Над тілом поглумилися: денікінці його тіло повісили за ноги на базарному стовпі в Мирівці для залякування населення. Похований на цвинтарі села Янівка Ставинської волості Київського повіту.

His expertise as a military and public figure could have helped to shape the Ukrainian People's Republic and establish stronger alliances with neighboring countries.

I should’ve told you about the situation with your brother and me.” Sayori: “It’s okay, sis. We’ve talked things out, and I understand now.” Sayori’s sister: “That’s good to hear.

Kanna is the master of a Martial Arts style that allows her to easily kill a bull with her bare hands. While normally brave, she is afraid of snakes. She sometimes gets into an argument with Sumire over their differences in attitude. Her uniform is red. Yuiichi Kayama-Graduating from the same naval academy as Ichiro Ogami at the same time, Kayama was intended as the original replacement for Maria as leader of the Flower Division. However, after it was found that his above average spiritual power was still not enough to power a Kobu, General Yoneda found a different use for him. Given command of the Moon Division, or “Moon Division” (the reconnaissance and intelligence unit for the Flower Division), Kayama’s role is to carry out any and all covert missions for the general. As part of his duties he is often seen in disguise, whilst discreetly passing on information to Yoneda. He has some limited psychic abilities, including being able to induce hallucinations in others, according to the anime. This was done in the TV series. Write alternate scenarios for the Sakura Taisen series after episode 7 “A Tasty Order”, which goes the same except after the tall and muscular rough martial artist Kanna Kirishima from the Flower Division saves Yuichi Kayama captain of the Moon Division from one of the Hive of Darkness’s Four Deathlords at an alley by grabbing him and carrying him over her shoulder at the start of the episode, he begins to develop feelings for her, and how it would affect proceeding episodes, especially since he never interacts with any of them due to his role as a secret agent for the Imperial Combat Revue hiding behind the shadows, and the effect on both groups, especially Kanna who was also told to act as if she didn’t know him for secrecy, like in episode 9 where he appears again and was about to be captured until Ohgami was captured not noticing it was him and the rest of the group find him and warn him Ohgami was captured, and Ichiro Ohgami, Kanna’s captain and Yuichi’s friend, who doesn’t know his role but noticed his presence but never found out it was him in episode 20, or in episode 24 where Ohgami takes over as commander and Kayama reveals himself to Ohgami and the rest of the Flower Division how does Kanna react and what is her’s and Kayama interactions like? Or in the last episode where he aids Ohgami in fighting two of the Hive of Darkness’s Four Deathlords so he could escape and join the rest of the Flower Division in combat, what is their interactions like? And after the final battle, when the entire team gathers to see the Cherry Blossoms bloom, what are their interactions like?","output":"Alternate Scenario - Episode 8: \\"Bonded Hearts in the Moonlight\\" In this episode, Kanna struggles with her secret relationship with Yuichi. She is torn between her loyalty to her team and her newfound feelings for the mysterious captain of the Moon Division. During a mission, Kanna happens to spot Yuichi in one of his disguises, and her reaction inadvertently puts the team in danger. Ichiro becomes suspicious as he notices the tension between Kanna and Yuichi, but is unable to pinpoint the root cause. To protect their secret, Kanna and Yuichi try to maintain a professional distance, which only fuels the attraction between them. Alternate Scenario - Episode 10: \\"The Shadowed Vow\\" Realizing the risk their relationship poses to both teams, Kanna and Yuichi decide to distance themselves from each other to focus on their duties. However, they can't seem to escape each other, as Yuichi is called upon to help the Flower Division with a mission. When an enemy threatens the team, it's up to Kanna and Yuichi to combine their skills and save the day, causing the two to grow even closer. The team begins to notice the strong connection between them, but Kanna and Yuichi swear them to secrecy. Alternate Scenario - Episode 20: \\"Secrets Revealed\\" Their secret relationship takes a turn when, during a heated battle, Kanna is injured to protect Yuichi. Ichiro finally learns about the secret bond between Kanna and Yuichi, causing conflicts between the two team captains. Struggling with the guilt of having endangered his team and Kanna, Yuichi offers to leave the Moon Division. However, the team convinces him to stay, realizing that their combined strengths can overcome any obstacle. Alternate Scenario - Episode 24: \\"United in Love and War\\" In this climactic episode, Kanna is caught in a potentially fatal situation, forcing Yuichi to reveal his true feelings for her. This revelation empowers the entire team as they battle the Deathlords in an epic confrontation. Following the battle, Kanna and Yuichi are given the blessing of their teams to continue their relationship openly.

Да, до первой тройки дотянуться им было невозможно, да я думаю что даже в равных условиях Алонсо и Хэмилтон выглядели быстрее, но вот без особых проблем защититься от позадиидущего Переса, да ещё и на харде, вот это действительно показатель. На все намеки Сайнса выпустить его вперед, Скудерия ответила отказом, и более того заверила Шарля в том, что Карлос не будет его атаковать, то есть по сути итальянцы применили командную тактику, которая, действительно сработала. Даже с последующим переходом на медиум, Чеко так и не смог подобраться к своим соперникам. Поэтому с одной стороны можно говорить о том, что Феррари действительно начали лучше чувствовать себя по работе с резиной, но с другой нельзя незаметить факта того, что мексиканец, также как и в прошлом году, после первого пакета обновлений очень сильно отстает от Ферстаппена и даже начинает проигрывать представителям других коллективов.

Як придатного до військової служби мобілізували на початку Першої Світової війни до Російського Флоту Його Імператорської Величності. Службу проходив на Балтійському флоті. Декілька разів ходив у далекі походи, мав нагороди Російської Імперії (не збереглися). На початку 1917 року повернувся до рідного села Янівки, взяв активну участь у встановлені влади Центральної Ради Української Народної Республіки у Ставинській волості. За спогадами Марко Шляхового-Кармелюка «Отаман Дьяків — мав од роду років 29 — 30, величезного росту козак і ходив завше у козацькому — чорноморського козака катеринівських часів — вбранні. Батько його був бідний селянин. З початку революції 1917 року Дьяків, перебуваючи на морській флотській службі російської армії, брав участь в українських військових організаціях Чорноморської фльоти. Коли Чорноморська фльота, як і другі, стали під кінець 1917 року більшовичитись, Дьяків кинув фльоту і самовільно прибув до Центральної Ради. Тут в часи бійки Центральної Ради з більшовиками в січні 1918 року, Дьяків був вже вільним козаком. З того часу у своєму районі на Київщині став отаманом Вільного Козацтва. Як казав мені сам Дьяков, він так любив Центральну Раду і тодішніх її проводирів, що завжди був готовий віддати своє життя в боротьбі з її ворогами, а особливо з московським чорносотенним большевизмом, в початкові боротьбі з яким він, Дьяків, і загартував свою козацьку відвагу»(Марко Шляховий-Кармелюк неточно навів дані по нього щодо служби на флоті). Однодумець отамана Зеленого (Данила Терпила) у питанні державності та, одночасно, опонент щодо засобів досягнення мети, організував йому спротив проти накладення «реквізицій» на місцеве населення Кагарлика наприкінці 1918 року. У серпні-вересні 1919 року розгромив осередок радянської влади у волосному містечку Германівка Київського повіту, якою за влади більшовиків у Києві протягом 1919 року організовувалися збройне пограбування (вилучення зерна, борошна та іншої їжі) селян найближчих волостей за завданням проросійського уряду Української радянської соціалістичної республіки. Дружина Ганна Олексіївна, діти: Павло, Петро, Віра та Марія. Ніколи не мав сина Якова, з посиланням на свідчення якого Саві Дьякові приписують участь у загибелі отамана Зеленого. За свідченнями у 2011 році його доньки Марії (мешкала у тій же самій хаті, в якій жила сім’я Сави Дьякова у 1919 році, в селі Янівка) під час загибелі отамана Зеленого знаходився у містечку Стави Київського повіту, отримавши доповідь про його загибель, вирушив із власним загоном до загону отамана Зеленого для з’ясування обставин загибелі та визначення подальших дій. Зраджений місцевим селянином із села Янівка, який звернувся до Сави Дьякова за захистом від пограбування денікінцями цукрового заводу в Узині та вивів його 13 грудня 1919 року з невеликим загоном до засідки біля волосного містечка Мирівка Київського повіту, де Сава Дьяків загинув у бою. Над тілом поглумилися: денікінці його тіло повісили за ноги на базарному стовпі в Мирівці для залякування населення. Похований на цвинтарі села Янівка Ставинської волості Київського повіту.

As a young man, he was forcibly mobilized into the Russian Navy and served on the Baltic Fleet during World War I.

He fought against the Bolsheviks and organized resistance to the plundering of the local population by both the Soviet authorities and the Denikin army. Dyakiv was betrayed by a local peasant who turned him over to the Denikin army, and he was killed in a battle near the village of Myrivka, Kyiv Oblast in December 1919.

I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this? He’s been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she’s pregnant with his child!” Monika: “Oh no, this is not good. We have to talk to MC about this, and figure out what’s going on.” Yuri: “Yes, we can’t just jump to conclusions. We have to get the full story first before we make any judgments.” (I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I could only imagine how Sayori was feeling. But I knew we couldn’t just ignore this and pretend everything was okay. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on.) Natsuki: “I agree, we need to talk to him, but let’s not be too harsh. We don’t know what’s going on in his life, and he might be going through a tough time.” Sayori: “But he shouldn’t have betrayed me like this. And with my own sister…” Monika: “I understand how you feel, Sayori, but let’s try to handle this maturely. We don’t want to lose MC as a friend, but we also need to support you through this difficult situation.” (I could see the worry and concern on Monika’s face. She was always the voice of reason in our club, and I knew she would help us through this situation.) Yuri: “I agree. We should approach him peacefully and calmly, and let him know how we’re feeling. Maybe he has a good reason for what he’s been doing.” (I could see that Yuri was trying to be the peacemaker in this situation. But I could also tell she was worried about the outcome of our conversation with MC.) Sayori: “Okay, let’s talk to him. But I’m still really mad.” (I could see the fury in Sayori’s eyes as we all left the clubroom to find MC. This was not going to be an easy conversation, but we had to do it. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on. Eventually, we saw MC in the park.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (We all looked at each other nervously, unsure of who should speak first.) Monika: “MC, we need to talk to you about something.” (MC’s expression changed to a look of concern as he saw the seriousness on our faces.) MC: “What’s going on? Is everything okay?” Natsuki: “We… found out about you and Sayori’s sister. And the baby…” (MC’s face turned red as he looked down at the ground.) MC: “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.” Sayori: “How could you do this to me? You know how much I care about you!” MC: “I know, Sayori. And I care about you too. I never meant to hurt you, and I never meant for this to happen.” Yuri: “Can you explain what’s been going on? We want to understand, and we’re here to support you.” (MC took a deep breath before he began to speak.) MC: “Thing is…she’s actually just my friend. And the baby she’s carrying actually belongs to my twin brother.” (The shock on our faces was evident as we all tried to process this new information.) Natsuki: “Your…twin brother?” MC: “Yeah. I never told anyone about him because he’s been going through a tough time and doesn’t like socializing. He got into a relationship with Sayori’s sister, and things got…complicated.” Monika: “So, this whole time, you’ve just been helping your brother out?” MC: “Yes. He didn’t want to tell anyone, and I didn’t want to betray his trust. But I understand how it looked from the outside, and I’m sorry for not telling you guys earlier.” Sayori: “So, you and my sister…you’re not in a relationship?” MC: “No, we’re not. We’re just friends.” (As the reality of the situation set in, I could see the relief on everyone’s faces, especially Sayori’s.) Sayori: “I…I’m sorry for jumping to conclusions, MC.

And as we walked back towards the clubroom, I knew that we had experienced another obstacle that we had overcome together as a club. Just then, Sayori’s phone started ringing.) Sayori: “Oh, it’s my sister. I should answer it.” (She answered the phone, and we could hear her sister’s voice on the other end.) Sayori’s sister: “Hey, Sayori. I’m sorry about everything. I should’ve told you about the situation with your brother and me.” Sayori: “It’s okay, sis. We’ve talked things out, and I understand now.” Sayori’s sister: “That’s good to hear.

We can all move forward from this.” Yuri: “Yes, and hopefully we won’t have to deal with any other surprises!” Natsuki: “Yeah, let’s hope so. But knowing our club, anything can happen.” (We all laughed again, grateful for each other’s company and support.

The matchup between these two players garnered a lot of attention, as Gasol was known for his stiff defense and Curry for his exceptional shooting and playmaking abilities. Gasol was tasked with guarding Curry throughout the game, and he did not disappoint. The Grizzlies center used his size and strength to put constant pressure on Curry, making it difficult for the Warriors point guard to get open looks. Despite Gasol's efforts, Curry still managed to score 27 points in the game, but it was clear that his performance was not up to his usual standards. Gasol's physical defense forced Curry to take contested shots, which resulted in a lower shooting percentage than usual. Gasol's defensive efforts also helped the Grizzlies win the game, as they held off the Warriors with a final score of 96-91. Gasol finished the game with 12 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 blocks. Overall, Gasol's defense on Curry was one of the standout moments of the 2015 NBA season, showcasing the importance of strong defense in basketball and the impact it can have on even the league's top players."},{"instruction":"write a 2015 nba season with curry crossover on marc gasol","output":"The 2015 NBA season was filled with exciting moments, but one of the most memorable was when Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors embarrassed Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies with a wicked crossover move. It was during a matchup between the two teams in which Gasol was tasked with guarding Curry. The reigning MVP had the ball in his hands and was sizing up the Grizzlies' big man. Curry then dribbled between his legs, faked to the right, and quickly shifted to the left, sending Gasol stumbling to the ground. The Oracle Arena erupted in cheers as Curry calmly sunk a three-point shot over the fallen Gasol. The move instantly became a viral sensation and was replayed countless times on sports highlights shows, social media, and the internet. Despite Gasol's efforts to recuperate from the crossover, he couldn't catch up to Curry's lighting-quick speed and agility. Curry finished the game with 37 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 assists, shooting an impressive 13 of 23 from the field, including 6 of 11 from beyond the arc. On the other hand, Gasol struggled offensively, scoring only 6 points and committing several costly turnovers. The Warriors went on to win the game 106-94. Curry's crossover on Gasol was not only a flashy move but a testament to his incredible ball-handling skills and agility. It also served as a reminder that even the best defenders in the NBA can be left in the dust by a masterful crossover move."},{"instruction":"write a 2015 nba season with warriors blow out kings","output":"In the 2015 NBA season, the Golden State Warriors were one of the most dominant teams in the league, and the Sacramento Kings were among their struggling opponents. During a regular season game between the two teams, the Warriors blew out the Kings in a commanding victory. From the beginning of the game, the Warriors were firing on all cylinders. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green led the charge, scoring points in rapid succession and giving the Kings no chance to catch up. The Kings, on the other hand, struggled to hit shots, and their defense was no match for the Warriors' high-powered offense. The Warriors' bench players even got in on the action, contributing significantly to the scoring effort. By the end of the game, the Warriors had outscored the Kings by a score of 128-108, with Curry scoring 38 points, Thompson scoring 26 points, and Green tallying 13 points, 9 rebounds, and 6 assists. The victory was a significant one for the Warriors, who would go on to win the NBA championship that year.

In a game against the Dallas Mavericks during that season, Stephen Curry and Draymond Green combined for a spectacular play that showcased the Warriors' strengths. With just over a minute left in the game, the Warriors held a slim lead over the Mavericks. Draymond Green drove towards the basket with the ball, drawing the attention of the Mavericks' defenders. As he approached the hoop, he suddenly passed the ball back to Curry who was waiting at the three-point line. Curry caught the pass and quickly released the ball, sending it sailing towards the basket. The ball swished through the net, giving the Warriors a six-point lead and sending the Oracle Arena into a frenzy. The play highlighted the Warriors' ability to move the ball quickly and efficiently, as well as their deadly three-point shooting.

The source of the feud was fueled by both players' competitive nature and the intense rivalry between their respective teams. It began when Harden commented on Curry's style of play, saying that the recognition Curry was receiving was due to the Warriors' success as a team, rather than Curry's individual skills. Curry fired back at Harden, stating that he was a better player because he led his team to victory and could do everything on the floor - shoot, pass, and defend. The two players traded barbs back and forth through the media, and their rivalry reached its peak during a regular season matchup in February 2015. The game was intense and closely contested, with both Harden and Curry trying to outdo each other. Harden put up 37 points, while Curry scored 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. However, it was Curry who had the last laugh, as he hit a game-winning shot from beyond the arc in the final seconds of the game. Despite Curry's victory in the game, the feud continued for the rest of the season and spilled into the playoffs. The two players faced off in the Western Conference Finals, a matchup that the Warriors ultimately won en route to their NBA championship. The feud between Harden and Curry was a reminder of the intense competition in the NBA and the impact of individual rivalries on the court.

The incident involved James Harden of the Rockets committing a blocking foul on Stephen Curry of the Warriors. The play occurred late in the fourth quarter of a closely contested game. Curry drove to the basket and appeared to have a clear path to the hoop, but Harden stepped in front of him, attempting to draw a charge. However, the referee called a blocking foul on Harden, signaling that he had not established position before Curry began his shot. The call infuriated Harden and the Rockets, who argued that he had established position and that the call was unfair. Nevertheless, Curry was awarded two free throws and made both of them, giving the Warriors a three-point lead. The play, which was replayed countless times on sports highlights shows, social media, and the internet, sparked intense debate over whether the call was correct or not. Many fans, analysts, and players believed that Harden had established position and that the call should have gone his way. Despite the controversy, the Warriors held on to win the game by a final score of 110-106, with Curry finishing the game with 29 points and 11 assists. Harden, on the other hand, had a strong game, scoring 33 points and grabbing 10 rebounds.

In the game, the Warriors were leading by five points in the third quarter when Curry found himself with the ball near the paint. With Pelicans defenders surrounding him, Curry faked a shot and then double-clutched before releasing a high-arching layup that dropped into the basket. The crowd at the Oracle Arena erupted in cheers as the Warriors bench jumped up in excitement. The play was replayed countless times on sports highlights shows, on social media, and on the internet. Not only was the move aesthetically impressive, but it was a crucial moment in the game that helped the Warriors maintain their lead and eventually secure the victory.

I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori’s twin sister.) Sayori: “Can you believe this? He’s been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she’s pregnant with his child!” Monika: “Oh no, this is not good. We have to talk to MC about this, and figure out what’s going on.” Yuri: “Yes, we can’t just jump to conclusions. We have to get the full story first before we make any judgments.” (I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I could only imagine how Sayori was feeling. But I knew we couldn’t just ignore this and pretend everything was okay. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on.) Natsuki: “I agree, we need to talk to him, but let’s not be too harsh. We don’t know what’s going on in his life, and he might be going through a tough time.” Sayori: “But he shouldn’t have betrayed me like this. And with my own sister…” Monika: “I understand how you feel, Sayori, but let’s try to handle this maturely. We don’t want to lose MC as a friend, but we also need to support you through this difficult situation.” (I could see the worry and concern on Monika’s face. She was always the voice of reason in our club, and I knew she would help us through this situation.) Yuri: “I agree. We should approach him peacefully and calmly, and let him know how we’re feeling. Maybe he has a good reason for what he’s been doing.” (I could see that Yuri was trying to be the peacemaker in this situation. But I could also tell she was worried about the outcome of our conversation with MC.) Sayori: “Okay, let’s talk to him.

I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.” Sayori: “How could you do this to me? You know how much I care about you!” MC: “I know, Sayori. And I care about you too. I never meant to hurt you, and I never meant for this to happen.” Yuri: “Can you explain what’s been going on?

I never told anyone about him because he’s been going through a tough time and doesn’t like socializing. He got into a relationship with Sayori’s sister, and things got…complicated.” Monika: “So, this whole time, you’ve just been helping your brother out?” MC: “Yes. He didn’t want to tell anyone, and I didn’t want to betray his trust.

Однако этот метод также имеет свои ограничения, так как возможно появление новых частот, которые не имеют ничего общего с предыдущими. Например, если возник старение конструкции или появилось новое механическое повреждение, это может привести к возникновению новой частоты, не связанной непосредственно со старыми частотами. Таким образом, для более точной диагностики и определения причин изменений в конструкции, желательно использовать несколько методов мониторинга, анализируя данные со всех методов в комплексе. Такой подход позволит получить более полную информацию о состоянии конструкции и определять возможные причины возникновения новых частот."},{"instruction":"(I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop.

Если p проходит все k тестов, то с вероятностью ошибки не более чем 2^-k число p считается простым. 4) Тест Лукаса-Лемера: Если p - простое число, то числа M(k) = 2^k - 1 для k>1 и Лукас-Лемерово число S(k) = 4S(k-1)^2 - 2 для k>2, где S(1)=4 просты, если и только если p делит S(p-2)."},{"instruction":"как определить, является число простым","output":"Существует несколько способов определить, является ли число простым: 1) Перебор делителей: мы можем перебирать все числа от 2 до n-1 и проверять, делится ли n на эти числа без остатка. Если нет, то число является простым. Однако для больших чисел этот способ неэффективен. 2) Тест Ферма: проверяем, является ли a^n-1 сравнимым с 1 по модулю n для всех целых a, неразложимых на множители с n. Если ответ положительный, то число n скорее всего простое. Однако существуют псевдопростые числа, которые проходят тест, но не являются простыми. 3) Тест Миллера-Рабина: алгоритм, основанный на тесте Ферма, но дополнительно проверяет случаи, когда a^(n/2^r) +1 =/-1. Если число проходит несколько итераций теста, то оно считается простым с высокой вероятностью. 4) Тест Соловея–Штрассена: алгоритм, основанный на методе рекурсивных квадратичных вычетов. Если число проходит несколько итераций теста, то оно считается простым с высокой вероятностью. Что использовать в конкретной ситуации, зависит от требований к точности результата и от размеров числа. Для малых чисел можно использовать перебор, а для больших чисел лучше использовать тесты, основанные на теории чисел."},{"instruction":"реши на c++ задачу: Петя, изучая, как меняется курс рубля по отношению к доллару и евро, вывел закон, по которому происходят эти изменения (или думает, что вывел :) ).

Як придатного до військової служби мобілізували на початку Першої Світової війни до Російського Флоту Його Імператорської Величності. Службу проходив на Балтійському флоті. Декілька разів ходив у далекі походи, мав нагороди Російської Імперії (не збереглися). На початку 1917 року повернувся до рідного села Янівки, взяв активну участь у встановлені влади Центральної Ради Української Народної Республіки у Ставинській волості. За спогадами Марко Шляхового-Кармелюка «Отаман Дьяків — мав од роду років 29 — 30, величезного росту козак і ходив завше у козацькому — чорноморського козака катеринівських часів — вбранні. Батько його був бідний селянин. З початку революції 1917 року Дьяків, перебуваючи на морській флотській службі російської армії, брав участь в українських військових організаціях Чорноморської фльоти. Коли Чорноморська фльота, як і другі, стали під кінець 1917 року більшовичитись, Дьяків кинув фльоту і самовільно прибув до Центральної Ради. Тут в часи бійки Центральної Ради з більшовиками в січні 1918 року, Дьяків був вже вільним козаком. З того часу у своєму районі на Київщині став отаманом Вільного Козацтва. Як казав мені сам Дьяков, він так любив Центральну Раду і тодішніх її проводирів, що завжди був готовий віддати своє життя в боротьбі з її ворогами, а особливо з московським чорносотенним большевизмом, в початкові боротьбі з яким він, Дьяків, і загартував свою козацьку відвагу»(Марко Шляховий-Кармелюк неточно навів дані по нього щодо служби на флоті). Однодумець отамана Зеленого (Данила Терпила) у питанні державності та, одночасно, опонент щодо засобів досягнення мети, організував йому спротив проти накладення «реквізицій» на місцеве населення Кагарлика наприкінці 1918 року. У серпні-вересні 1919 року розгромив осередок радянської влади у волосному містечку Германівка Київського повіту, якою за влади більшовиків у Києві протягом 1919 року організовувалися збройне пограбування (вилучення зерна, борошна та іншої їжі) селян найближчих волостей за завданням проросійського уряду Української радянської соціалістичної республіки. Дружина Ганна Олексіївна, діти: Павло, Петро, Віра та Марія. Ніколи не мав сина Якова, з посиланням на свідчення якого Саві Дьякові приписують участь у загибелі отамана Зеленого. За свідченнями у 2011 році його доньки Марії (мешкала у тій же самій хаті, в якій жила сім’я Сави Дьякова у 1919 році, в селі Янівка) під час загибелі отамана Зеленого знаходився у містечку Стави Київського повіту, отримавши доповідь про його загибель, вирушив із власним загоном до загону отамана Зеленого для з’ясування обставин загибелі та визначення подальших дій. Зраджений місцевим селянином із села Янівка, який звернувся до Сави Дьякова за захистом від пограбування денікінцями цукрового заводу в Узині та вивів його 13 грудня 1919 року з невеликим загоном до засідки біля волосного містечка Мирівка Київського повіту, де Сава Дьяків загинув у бою.

With his military and political expertise, he may have helped the Ukrainian People's Republic consolidate its territory and establish stronger alliances with neighboring countries. It is likely that the borders of the Ukrainian People's Republic would have been larger and more firmly established, potentially extending beyond the current boundaries of Ukraine to include more of the traditionally Ukrainian speaking regions in neighboring countries. It is possible that the names of some states could have changed or evolved as a result of political developments and historical changes. In terms of alliances, it is possible that Ukraine could have entered into a closer relationship with other countries in the region, such as Poland or the Baltic States, in order to strengthen its security and economic development. It is also possible that NATO or a similar defensive alliance could have been established to counteract any perceived threats from outside powers.

Why is MC with her?” Sayori: “He’s been cheating on us, Natsuki. He’s been seeing her behind our backs.” Monika: “We don’t know that for sure, Sayori. Maybe there’s a reasonable explanation.” Yuri: “I-I don’t know, Monika. It seems pretty clear to me.” (Silence fell among us as we tried to process what was happening.

The girl in the photo is his twin sister who has been by his side.” My anger dissipated as I felt a wave of relief wash over me. It wasn’t MC’s fault that he was unable to communicate with us, and the girl in the photo was just his sister. Sayori: “Oh no, did we jump to conclusions too quickly?” Monika: “It’s okay, Sayori.

But then, a thought occurred to me - what if the pregnant girl was someone close to MC? Maybe a relative or a friend? I couldn’t imagine he’d willingly hurt us like this. So, I spoke up, trying to offer a different perspective. Natsuki: “Maybe…maybe there’s a reason why MC is with her? Maybe she’s important to him in some way?” Sayori: “What do you mean, Natsuki?” Natsuki: “Well…maybe the pregnant girl is someone close to him. Maybe she needs his help or support, and that’s why she’s with him. It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s cheating on us.” Monika: “That’s a good point, Natsuki. We shouldn’t jump to conclusions without getting all the facts.” Yuri: “Agreed.

Boko Haram is a jihadist group that operates in Nigeria and neighboring countries, seeking to establish an Islamic state. The group has carried out numerous violent attacks, including bombings, kidnappings, and massacres, targeting civilians, government officials, and security forces. Sabotage and infiltration are tactics that Boko Haram has used to carry out attacks. For example, the group has infiltrated Nigerian security forces, enabling them to carry out attacks from within. In addition, they have targeted infrastructure such as power stations, communication networks, and oil facilities. The group has also used suicide bombers to carry out attacks. The bombers are often young girls who have been kidnapped and brainwashed by the group. Boko Haram's attacks have had a devastating impact on the region, causing thousands of deaths and displacing millions of people.

Такая гипотеза была выдвинута в 1845 году французским математиком Джозефем Бертраном (проверившим ее до n=3000000) и доказана в 1850 году Пафнутием Чебышевым. Раманужан в 1920 году нашел более простое доказательство, а Эрдеш в 1932 – еще более простое. Ваша задача состоит в том, чтобы решить несколько более общую задачу – а именно по числу n найти количество простых чисел p из интервала n < p < 2n.

Step 2: Create a dropdown list Create a dropdown list that contains the available quotes. You can use various UI frameworks such as Lightning Design System or Visualforce pages. Step 3: Implement the quote selection functionality When the user selects a quote from the dropdown list, your code should perform the following steps: a. Retrieve the quote record from the database using the selected quote ID. b. Set the primary field of the selected quote to true. c. Query all other quotes related to the current opportunity and set their primary fields to false. Step 4: Test the class Test the class by selecting different quotes and verifying that the primary and non-primary flags are set correctly. Overall, the class should perform basic CRUD operations on the quote object, and use SOQL queries to read and update records based on the selected quote.

Як придатного до військової служби мобілізували на початку Першої Світової війни до Російського Флоту Його Імператорської Величності. Службу проходив на Балтійському флоті. Декілька разів ходив у далекі походи, мав нагороди Російської Імперії (не збереглися). На початку 1917 року повернувся до рідного села Янівки, взяв активну участь у встановлені влади Центральної Ради Української Народної Республіки у Ставинській волості. За спогадами Марко Шляхового-Кармелюка «Отаман Дьяків — мав од роду років 29 — 30, величезного росту козак і ходив завше у козацькому — чорноморського козака катеринівських часів — вбранні. Батько його був бідний селянин. З початку революції 1917 року Дьяків, перебуваючи на морській флотській службі російської армії, брав участь в українських військових організаціях Чорноморської фльоти. Коли Чорноморська фльота, як і другі, стали під кінець 1917 року більшовичитись, Дьяків кинув фльоту і самовільно прибув до Центральної Ради. Тут в часи бійки Центральної Ради з більшовиками в січні 1918 року, Дьяків був вже вільним козаком. З того часу у своєму районі на Київщині став отаманом Вільного Козацтва. Як казав мені сам Дьяков, він так любив Центральну Раду і тодішніх її проводирів, що завжди був готовий віддати своє життя в боротьбі з її ворогами, а особливо з московським чорносотенним большевизмом, в початкові боротьбі з яким він, Дьяків, і загартував свою козацьку відвагу»(Марко Шляховий-Кармелюк неточно навів дані по нього щодо служби на флоті). Однодумець отамана Зеленого (Данила Терпила) у питанні державності та, одночасно, опонент щодо засобів досягнення мети, організував йому спротив проти накладення «реквізицій» на місцеве населення Кагарлика наприкінці 1918 року. У серпні-вересні 1919 року розгромив осередок радянської влади у волосному містечку Германівка Київського повіту, якою за влади більшовиків у Києві протягом 1919 року організовувалися збройне пограбування (вилучення зерна, борошна та іншої їжі) селян найближчих волостей за завданням проросійського уряду Української радянської соціалістичної республіки. Дружина Ганна Олексіївна, діти: Павло, Петро, Віра та Марія. Ніколи не мав сина Якова, з посиланням на свідчення якого Саві Дьякові приписують участь у загибелі отамана Зеленого. За свідченнями у 2011 році його доньки Марії (мешкала у тій же самій хаті, в якій жила сім’я Сави Дьякова у 1919 році, в селі Янівка) під час загибелі отамана Зеленого знаходився у містечку Стави Київського повіту, отримавши доповідь про його загибель, вирушив із власним загоном до загону отамана Зеленого для з’ясування обставин загибелі та визначення подальших дій.

He was also an informal leader of the local government in the Stavynska volost and an organizer of resistance against the Soviet government and the Denikin forces in 1918-1919. He served in the Russian fleet during World War I and returned to his native village in 1917, taking an active part in establishing the power of the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic in the Stavynska volost. He was killed in a battle on December 13, 1919, by the Denikin forces, and his body was hanged for display on a market pole in the village of Mirivka."},{"instruction":"you can come up with a scenario Alternative History what if Дьяків Сава Федорович didn’t died in battle with a small detachment in an ambush near the village of Myrivka, Kyiv County, on December 13, 1919 And survived to our time!

Will there be NATO or something like it or not at all?","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot predict the exact scenarios and outcomes of alternative history scenarios, but I can provide a general response to the question. If Дьяків Сава Федорович had survived the battle in 1919, his influence on the Ukrainian liberation struggle and the formation of the Ukrainian state may have been significant. It is possible that he would have continued to play a pivotal role in Ukrainian politics and government, and his leadership could have shaped the course of the Ukrainian People's Republic. In terms of the borders of the Ukrainian People's Republic, it is difficult to predict how they would have been affected by Дьяків Сава Федорович's survival. The borders could have remained the same, or he may have advocated for expansion or contraction of the territory. The names of the states could have also been affected by his leadership and political influence. As for alliances, it is possible that Дьяків Сава Федорович would have sought alliances with other European nations, including those in NATO, to establish Ukraine as an independent and sovereign state. It is also possible that he would have sought alliances with other Eastern European nations to maintain regional stability and security. Overall, the survival of Дьяків Сава Федорович could have had significant impacts on the political, social, and economic development of Ukraine and its relations with other nations in Europe and beyond."},{"instruction":"you can come up with a scenario Alternative History what if Дьяків Сава Федорович didn’t died in battle with a small detachment in an ambush near the village of Myrivka, Kyiv County, on December 13, 1919 And survived to our time!

However, here is a possible scenario: If Дьяків Сава Федорович had survived the battle in 1919, his leadership and influence could have potentially changed the course of the Ukrainian liberation struggle. With his military and political acumen, he could have been a major political figure and leader of the Ukrainian People's Republic. It is possible that under his leadership, the Ukrainian People's Republic could have expanded its borders and achieved greater recognition and support from European nations. He may have negotiated alliances and formed military partnerships with other Eastern European nations, potentially even leading to the formation of a regional security alliance similar to NATO. With Дьяків's strong leadership, Ukraine may have been able to consolidate its sovereignty and establish itself as a strong, independent nation. The names of states could have also been affected with his political influence, as he may have sought to emphasize the Ukrainian heritage and identity. As for how many years he could have lived, it is difficult to predict. However, given the dangers and instability of politics and warfare during that time, it is possible that he could have faced further assassination attempts or other dangers that could have cut his life short. Nonetheless, his impact on Ukrainian history and politics would have likely been significant."},{"instruction":"you can come up with a scenario Alternative History what if Дьяків Сава Федорович didn’t died in battle with a small detachment in an ambush near the village of Myrivka, Kyiv County, on December 13, 1919 And survived to our time!

It is possible that if Дьяків had survived, he could have continued to play a significant role in the Ukrainian liberation struggle and the formation of the Ukrainian state. His leadership could have potentially resulted in greater political stability and territorial expansion for Ukraine. However, it is difficult to predict what the borders of the Ukrainian People's Republic would have looked like or whether the names of states would have changed. These factors would be influenced by a range of political and historical developments, some of which may have been beyond Дьяків's control. In terms of alliances, it is possible that Ukraine could have formed military partnerships with other European nations or with Eastern European neighbors. The formation of NATO or a similar regional security organization could also be possible, given the continuing geopolitical challenges in the region. As for Дьяків's lifespan, it is impossible to predict how long he would have lived. However, given the dangers and instability of politics and warfare during that time, it is possible that he could have faced further assassination attempts or other dangers that could have cut his life short.

Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.) Sayori: “I can’t believe this! MC has been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too! How could he do this to me?” Monika: “Sayori, calm down. We don’t know for sure that he’s cheating. Maybe they’re just friends.” Yuri: “But the picture seems to suggest otherwise. And that girl’s belly…she’s definitely pregnant.” Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?” (Just then, MC enters the room.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.) Sayori: “How could you, MC?” MC: “What do you mean?” (Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.) Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!” MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.” (Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.) Sayori: “Your cousin?” MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.” (Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.) Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions. I just saw the picture and…” MC: “It’s alright, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” (Yuri and Monika both look relieved, and the tension in the room eases.) Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?” (Everyone nods, and we all move on from the misunderstanding. A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.) Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.” MC: “No problem, Emily. We just wanted to see how you and the baby are doing.” Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily. And congratulations on becoming a mother.” Emily: “Thank you, Yuri. It’s been quite the journey.” Sayori: “I’m sorry again for jumping to the wrong conclusion about you, Emily. I didn’t mean to make things awkward.” Emily: “Don’t worry about it, Sayori. I understand why you were upset. But I promise you, MC has been nothing but a supportive cousin to me throughout this whole pregnancy.” Monika: “Well, now that everything’s cleared up, let’s celebrate the new addition to the family!” (We all cheer and bring out a cake to celebrate Emily’s soon-to-be-born baby. It was a warm and joyous occasion, and we all felt grateful to have each other in our lives. But just moments before we were supposed to leave, Emily and I started to feel pain in our bellies.)","output":"Natsuki: \\"Wait, are you okay, Emily?\\" Emily: \\"I-I don't know.

Let me grab the car keys.\\" Yuri: \\"I'll call an ambulance just in case.\\" Monika: \\"And I'll stay here with Natsuki in case the ambulance arrives before we can get Emily to the hospital.\\" (We all quickly spring into action, with MC and Sayori helping Emily into the car and driving as fast as they can to the nearest hospital. Yuri manages to get an ambulance on the way, just in case. Monika and I wait anxiously in Emily's apartment, hoping for the best.) Natsuki: \\"I hope everything's going to be okay.\\" Monika: \\"I'm sure it will be. Emily's in good hands with MC and Sayori taking care of her.\\" (After what feels like an eternity, MC and Sayori finally return to the apartment, a small bundle in MC's arms.) MC: \\"Everyone, meet my new cousin. Her name is Sophie.\\" Yuri: \\"Oh my goodness, she's adorable.\\" Sayori: \\"Congratulations, MC. You're going to be a great cousin.\\" Natsuki: \\"And Emily, she's okay right?\\" MC: \\"Yeah, she's fine. She's still recovering, but she and the baby are both healthy.\\" Monika: \\"I'm so relieved everything turned out okay.\\" (Sophie's arrival may have been unexpected, but it brought us all even closer together. We all held her, oohing and aahing over her tiny features. It was a beautiful reminder of the fragility of life, and how important it is to cherish every moment we have together.)"},{"instruction":"jesse owens e storia collegamenti","output":"Jesse Owens è stato un atleta statunitense, nato l'12 settembre 1913, noto soprattutto per la sua partecipazione alle Olimpiadi estive del 1936 a Berlino, in cui vinse quattro medaglie d'oro. La sua partecipazione alle Olimpiadi del 1936 è stata particolarmente significativa a causa del contesto storico in cui si è svolta: l'evento è stato organizzato dal regime nazista di Adolf Hitler, che stava promuovendo attivamente la superiorità della razza ariana. Owens, come atleta di colore, ha dimostrato la falsità di tali teorie, stabilendo nuovi record in discipline come i 100 metri, i 200 metri, il salto in lungo e la staffetta 4x100 metri. La sua prestazione alle Olimpiadi del 1936 è stata considerata un trionfo per la causa degli afroamericani nel loro lungo percorso di lotta contro la discriminazione e il razzismo. Owens ha continuato a lavorare per la promozione dell'uguaglianza razziale per il resto della sua vita. Per quanto riguarda i collegamenti con la storia, la vicenda di Jesse Owens rappresenta un esempio importante di come lo sport possa avere un impatto significativo sulla società e sulla politica. La sua partecipazione alle Olimpiadi del 1936 ha messo in discussione le teorie razziste del regime nazista e ha dimostrato al mondo intero che l'ideologia della superiorità della razza ariana non era basata su nessun fondamento scientifico.

Nonostante non abbia mai partecipato a competizioni ufficiali in Italia, Owens ha comunque avuto l'opportunità di visitare il Paese in diverse occasioni. Inoltre, Jesse Owens ha influenzato la cultura italiana, soprattutto nella diffusione dello sport come strumento per promuovere la solidarietà e l'uguaglianza sociale. Nel 1960, la squadra italiana di atletica leggera partecipò ai Giochi Olimpici di Roma e si distinse per i risultati positivi raggiunti, dimostrando che lo sport può essere un mezzo per superare le barriere razziali e sociali. Anche nella società italiana contemporanea persistono delle problematiche legate al razzismo e alla discriminazione, e la figura di Jesse Owens rappresenta ancora oggi un modello di coraggio e determinazione per tutti coloro che lottano contro queste ingiustizie.

Uno dei temi fondamentali della filosofia dello sport è la giustizia, intesa come equità e parità di opportunità per tutti gli atleti. Owens stessa ha lottato per ottenere questi valori, dimostrando al mondo intero che le teorie razziste e discriminanti erano prive di fondamento e che era possibile superare le barriere sociali ed economiche. Inoltre, Owens ha anche dimostrato la sua integrità e la sua lealtà nei confronti della squadra nazionale, anche in momenti difficili come quando era a rischio l'esclusione dai Giochi Olimpici del 1936. Questa etica dello sport si concentra sulla lealtà, sul rispetto e sulla dignità degli atleti, come dimostrato da Owens nel corso della sua carriera. Infine, la figura di Owens può essere anche vista come un esempio di come lo sport possa essere utilizzato come strumento per la diffusione di valori universali come l'uguaglianza, la cooperazione e la fiducia reciproca.

Такая гипотеза была выдвинута в 1845 году французским математиком Джозефем Бертраном (проверившим ее до n=3000000) и доказана в 1850 году Пафнутием Чебышевым. Раманужан в 1920 году нашел более простое доказательство, а Эрдеш в 1932 – еще более простое. Ваша задача состоит в том, чтобы решить несколько более общую задачу – а именно по числу n найти количество простых чисел p из интервала n < p < 2n. Напомним, что число называется простым, если оно делится только само на себя и на единицу.","output":"Для решения данной задачи можно воспользоваться теоремой Чебышева, которая утверждает, что количество простых чисел p в интервале от 1 до n примерно равно n/ln(n). Тогда количество простых чисел в интервале от n до 2n будет примерно равно (2n)/ln(2n) - n/ln(n). Для более точного результата можно воспользоваться уточненной теоремой Чебышева (пусть π(x) обозначает количество простых чисел не больше x): c * n/ln(n) < π(n) < C * n/ln(n) где c и C - некоторые константы. Используя данную формулу, можно оценить количество простых чисел в интервале от n до 2n более точно. Например, для n = 1000 получим: - по уточненной теореме Чебышева: 67 < π(1000) < 73 - количество простых чисел в интервале от 1000 до 2000 будет примерно равно (2*1000)/ln(4000) - 1000/ln(1000) = 71.6 Таким образом, можно сделать вывод, что количество простых чисел в интервале от n до 2n находится примерно в диапазоне от c * n/ln(n) до C * n/ln(n), где c и C - константы."},{"instruction":"реши на C++","output":"Вот пример кода на C++, который решает данную задачу: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <cmath> using namespace std; int main() { int n; cout << \\"Enter n: \\"; cin >> n; double lower_bound = 0.7 * n/log(n); // оценка снизу по уточненной теореме Чебышева double upper_bound = 1.3 * n/log(n); // оценка сверху по уточненной теореме Чебышева int count = 0; for (int i = n + 1; i < 2 * n; i++) { bool is_prime = true; for (int j = 2; j <= sqrt(i); j++) { if (i % j == 0) { is_prime = false; break; } } if (is_prime) { count++; } } cout << \\"Number of primes between \\" << n << \\" and \\" << 2*n << \\" is approximately \\"; cout << count << \\" (according to the estimation \\" << lower_bound << \\" - \\" << upper_bound << \\").\\" << endl; return 0; } \`\`\` Программа запрашивает число n и выводит оценку количества простых чисел в интервале от n до 2n, используя уточненную теорему Чебышева.

Вот пример кода на C++, который решает данную задачу через файлы: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <fstream> #include <cmath> using namespace std; int main() { ifstream fin(\\"input.txt\\"); ofstream fout(\\"output.txt\\"); int n; fin >> n; double lower_bound = 0.7 * n/log(n); // оценка снизу по уточненной теореме Чебышева double upper_bound = 1.3 * n/log(n); // оценка сверху по уточненной теореме Чебышева int count = 0; for (int i = n + 1; i < 2 * n; i++) { bool is_prime = true; for (int j = 2; j <= sqrt(double(i)); j++) { if (i % j == 0) { is_prime = false; break; } } if (is_prime) { count++; } } fout << count << endl; fout << lower_bound << \\" - \\" << upper_bound << endl; fin.close(); fout.close(); return 0; } \`\`\` В этой программе используются объекты классов \`ifstream\` (для чтения данных из файла) и \`ofstream\` (для записи результатов в файл). Сначала открываются файлы \`input.txt\` для чтения и \`output.txt\` для записи в начале программы. Затем считывается значение \`n\` из файла \`input.txt\`, а результаты (количество простых чисел и оценка) записываются в файл \`output.txt\`. В конце программы файлы закрываются. Входные и выходные файлы должны находиться в той же директории, что и исполняемый файл программы. Файл \`input.txt\` должен содержать значение \`n\`. Файл \`output.txt\` будет создан программой и будет содержать количество простых чисел в интервале от \`n\` до \`2n\` и оценку в строковом формате. Например, если в файле \`input.txt\` содержится число \`1000\`, то программа запишет в файл \`output.txt\` примерно следующий результат: \`\`\` 72 478.455 - 899.523 \`\`\` Первая строка содержит количество простых чисел в интервале от \`1000\` до \`2000\`. Вторая строка содержит оценку количества простых чисел в этом интервале по уточненной теореме Чебышева."},{"instruction":"напиши матрицу на c++","output":"Конечно, вот пример кода на C++, который создает матрицу и заполняет ее случайными значениями: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <cstdlib> // для функции rand() #include <ctime> // для функции time() using namespace std; const int ROWS = 3; const int COLS = 4; int main() { // Инициализируем генератор случайных чисел srand(time(NULL)); // Создаем матрицу int matrix[ROWS][COLS]; // Заполняем матрицу случайными значениями for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < COLS; j++) { matrix[i][j] = rand() % 10; } } // Выводим матрицу на экран for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < COLS; j++) { cout << matrix[i][j] << \\" \\"; } cout << endl; } return 0; } \`\`\` В этой программе создается матрица размером 3x4 и заполняется случайными значениями от 0 до 9.

I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl. Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.) Sayori: “I can’t believe this! MC has been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too! How could he do this to me?” Monika: “Sayori, calm down. We don’t know for sure that he’s cheating. Maybe they’re just friends.” Yuri: “But the picture seems to suggest otherwise. And that girl’s belly…she’s definitely pregnant.” Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?” (Just then, MC enters the room.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.) Sayori: “How could you, MC?” MC: “What do you mean?” (Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.) Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!” MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.” (Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.) Sayori: “Your cousin?” MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.” (Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.) Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions. I just saw the picture and…” MC: “It’s alright, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” (Yuri and Monika both look relieved, and the tension in the room eases.) Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?” (Everyone nods, and we all move on from the misunderstanding. A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.) Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.” MC: “No problem, Emily. We just wanted to see how you and the baby are doing.” Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily. And congratulations on becoming a mother.” Emily: “Thank you, Yuri. It’s been quite the journey.” Sayori: “I’m sorry again for jumping to the wrong conclusion about you, Emily. I didn’t mean to make things awkward.” Emily: “Don’t worry about it, Sayori. I understand why you were upset. But I promise you, MC has been nothing but a supportive cousin to me throughout this whole pregnancy.” Monika: “Well, now that everything’s cleared up, let’s celebrate the new addition to the family!” (We all cheer and bring out a cake to celebrate Emily’s soon-to-be-born baby. It was a warm and joyous occasion, and we all felt grateful to have each other in our lives. But just moments before we were supposed to leave, Emily and I started to feel pain in our bellies - labor pains at that.) Emily: “Oh no, it looks like it’s time. I’m about to give birth.” Natsuki: “And me too, I think. I wasn’t supposed to give birth for another week.” (MC rushes to help Emily, while Yuri and Monika help me.) MC: “Don’t worry, Emily. We’ll get you to the hospital.” Yuri: “And we’ll do the same for Natsuki.” Monika: “Let’s hurry, we don’t want to waste any time.” (Without another word, both me and Emily were rushed into the car. Emily was in the back seat, while I was in the trunk. But just before we could reach the hospital in time, my labor pains were getting stronger by the minute - and I knew I had to push.)","output":"Natsuki: “Ahh! I can’t hold it in anymore!” (Yuri and Monika both panic, not sure what to do.) Yuri: “We have to pull over! We can’t make it to the hospital in time.” Monika: “But where do we pull over?” (I scream in pain as another contraction hits me, and then suddenly, Monika spots a small clinic by the side of the road.) Monika: “There! We’ll take her there!” (Yuri quickly pulls over, and Monika and Yuri help me out of the car and rush me into the clinic. The nurse at the reception stares in shock as I waddle in, my water having already broken.) Nurse: “Oh my, you’re giving birth right now! Let me take you to the delivery room.” (In a flurry of activity, the nurse helps me onto a stretcher, and I’m taken to the delivery room. Meanwhile, MC and Emily make it to the hospital, where Emily is taken into the delivery room as well. Through sheer determination and strength, I finally give birth to a healthy baby girl.) Nurse: “Congratulations! It’s a girl.” (Yuri and Monika both come in, tears in their eyes as they see the baby. Emily’s voice is heard from the other room, as she too gives birth to a baby boy.) Emily: “Aaaahhhh! It’s a boy!” (MC comes in, looking exhausted but relieved.) MC: “Is everything okay?” Natsuki: “We did it. It’s a girl.” MC: “Congratulations, Natsuki. I’m so proud of you.” (I hold my newborn daughter tightly, tears streaming down my face.) Natsuki: “This was unexpected, but I’m so glad everything turned out okay.” Emily: “Me too. This was definitely a crazy adventure.” Monika: “And the babies are both healthy. That’s all that matters.” (Yuri hands me a blanket, and I wrap my daughter in it, feeling overwhelmed and happy.) Natsuki: “I don’t know what I would have done without you guys.” MC: “We’ll always be here for you, Natsuki.” (We all share a group hug, feeling grateful for our friendship and the new additions to our little club family.)"},{"instruction":"Give me 30 examples of short form you tube channel you can start that which only require text.","output":"1.

FFT取样率和取样点与最高输入信号频率和频率分率之间的关系","output":"FFT（快速傅里叶变换）是一种常用的数字信号处理技术，用于对连续时间的信号进行数字化处理，得到该信号的频率信息。FFT取样率和取样点与最高输入信号频率和频率分辨率之间的关系如下： 1. FFT取样率（sampling rate）与最高输入信号频率的关系： 要完整地采集输入信号的频率信息，需要保证取样率不小于该信号最高频率的两倍，即取样率≥2 × 最高输入信号频率。这是因为根据奈奎斯特采样定理，将连续时间的信号以Fs采样率进行采样，根据等间距采样定理，能够完整重构信号的频率变化，但前提是采样率必须不小于信号最高频率的两倍。 2. FFT取样点与频率分辨率的关系： 对于有限时域长为N的信号，在进行FFT变换时，一般需要将其分割为多个平均处理段进行FFT变换，因此FFT取样点数量N实际上代表了对输入信号的采样方法和采样精度，即采样率与频率分辨率之间的平衡。FFT取样点数量的选择会影响到频谱图的分辨率和灵敏度。假设输入信号的采样周期为Ts，则对应频率分辨率为Δf=1/Ts，采样点数N越大，频率分辨率Δf越小，同时，相应频率范围也会减小。 因此，FFT取样率和取样点数量是与最高输入信号频率和频率分辨率之间的关系密切相关的，需要进行合理的设计和选择，适应信号的不同特点和应用场合。"},{"instruction":"1. 频谱仪RBW设置与VBW设置对输入信号测量准确度的影响?","output":"在使用频谱仪进行频谱测量时，RBW（Resolution Bandwidth，分辨带宽）和VBW（Video Bandwidth，视频带宽）是两个重要的参数。它们的设置对频谱仪的测量准确度有一定的影响，具体如下： 1. RBW设置对测量准确度的影响 RBW代表测量系统对信号频率的分辨率，同时也决定了谱线的宽度。当RBW设置较小时，可以获得更高的频率分辨率，但同时也会增加噪声功率的影响，降低测量灵敏度。当RBW设置较大时，系统的频率分辨率降低，相应的测量灵敏度也会提高。因此，在选择RBW时需要权衡频率分辨率和灵敏度. 2. VBW设置对测量准确度的影响 VBW代表测量系统对信号的带宽，或者说是对信号进行平滑处理的带宽。当VBW设置较小时，系统的平滑处理比较弱，能够更好地显示信号的细节信息。当VBW设置较大时，平滑处理效果会更加明显，信噪比也会更高，但同时也会降低信号的分辨度。 总体而言，RBW和VBW的设置直接影响着测量系统的频率分辨率和测量灵敏度，在实际使用中需要根据具体要求进行调整。如果需要更精确的频率分辨率，可以采用较小的RBW值，但相应地会降低测量灵敏度；如果需要更高的信噪比和信号清晰度，可以采用较大的VBW值。需要注意的是，在进行测量时，应该将RBW和VBW设置为合适的值，以获得准确、稳定的测量结果。"},{"instruction":"1. 频谱仪RBW设置与VBW设置对输入信号测量准确度的影响?如GSM手机2W满功率发射时，当RBW设置为100KHz测得30dBm，而当RBW设置为200KHz测得33dBm，请问哪个测量更准确?为什么更准确?","output":"在进行频谱测量时，RBW和VBW的设置都会对测量结果产生影响，一般来说，较小的RBW可提供较高的频率解析度及较低的测量噪声，但同时需要更长的时间进行测量；而较大的RBW可提供更快的测量时间但具有较低的频率分辨率和较高的测量噪声。VBW是一个连续的平滑滤波器，用于对测量结果进行平滑处理，或者说是减小信号的纹波噪声，可以提高测量结果的稳定性。 回到问题本身，对于GSM手机2W满功率发射时，当RBW设置为100KHz测得30dBm，而当RBW设置为200KHz测得33dBm的情况，假设其它条件相同，则RBW设置为200KHz的测量更准确一些。 这是因为，当RBW设置较小时，测量结果受到系统的噪声和细节分辨率的影响，因此测量值较低；而当RBW设置较大时，由于平滑处理的影响，可减少信号的纹波噪声，并提高信噪比，从而使测量结果较高。同时，由于在高RBW的情况下，平滑处理的作用使得频率分辨率降低，因此RBW设置为200KHz的测量结果在所允许的误差范围内也相对更准确。 当然，在实践中，最准确的测量结果往往需要综合考虑多方面因素来得出，例如所采用的积分时间、噪声谱密度和峰值分布等。此外，为了保证测量准确性，还需要进行校正和校验来避免系统误差和外部干扰等影响。"},{"instruction":"1. 频谱仪通常具有最大峰值 (Max Peak)、最小峰值(Min Peak)、均方根 (RMS)、取样(Sample) 检波器，它们与Span/RBW比值关系是什么?如测量信号实际功率，应当选哪种类型检波器?为什么?","output":"在频谱仪中，常用的检波器包括最大峰值（Max Peak）、最小峰值（Min Peak）、均方根（RMS）和取样（Sample）等类型。这些检波器的选择与Span/RBW比值有关。 Span/RBW比值代表了采集过程中考虑的带宽范围。在较小的Span/RBW比值下，峰值检波器（如Max Peak检波器）能够快速检测到峰值信号，但易受到杂散信号和噪声的影响而导致测量误差；而在较大的Span/RBW比值下，RMS检波器可以更好地反映功率信号的真实水平，并能降低噪声的影响，但无法检测到突发信号和短时高峰的信号。 对于测量信号实际功率的情况，应当选择RMS检波器。因为RMS检波器能更好地反映信号的真实功率，并对于输入信号的振幅波动有较好的响应能力，适合于长时间或者分析功率的测量。与其他几种检波器不同的是，RMS检波器能够对信号进行平滑处理，减小信号的纹波噪声，提高测量结果的稳定性。"},{"instruction":"Who was Дьяків Сава Федорович?","output":"I'm sorry, I cannot provide information about individuals who do not have significant public notability or historical importance.

Як придатного до військової служби мобілізували на початку Першої Світової війни до Російського Флоту Його Імператорської Величності. Службу проходив на Балтійському флоті. Декілька разів ходив у далекі походи, мав нагороди Російської Імперії (не збереглися). На початку 1917 року повернувся до рідного села Янівки, взяв активну участь у встановлені влади Центральної Ради Української Народної Республіки у Ставинській волості. За спогадами Марко Шляхового-Кармелюка «Отаман Дьяків — мав од роду років 29 — 30, величезного росту козак і ходив завше у козацькому — чорноморського козака катеринівських часів — вбранні. Батько його був бідний селянин. З початку революції 1917 року Дьяків, перебуваючи на морській флотській службі російської армії, брав участь в українських військових організаціях Чорноморської фльоти. Коли Чорноморська фльота, як і другі, стали під кінець 1917 року більшовичитись, Дьяків кинув фльоту і самовільно прибув до Центральної Ради. Тут в часи бійки Центральної Ради з більшовиками в січні 1918 року, Дьяків був вже вільним козаком. З того часу у своєму районі на Київщині став отаманом Вільного Козацтва. Як казав мені сам Дьяков, він так любив Центральну Раду і тодішніх її проводирів, що завжди був готовий віддати своє життя в боротьбі з її ворогами, а особливо з московським чорносотенним большевизмом, в початкові боротьбі з яким він, Дьяків, і загартував свою козацьку відвагу»(Марко Шляховий-Кармелюк неточно навів дані по нього щодо служби на флоті). Однодумець отамана Зеленого (Данила Терпила) у питанні державності та, одночасно, опонент щодо засобів досягнення мети, організував йому спротив проти накладення «реквізицій» на місцеве населення Кагарлика наприкінці 1918 року. У серпні-вересні 1919 року розгромив осередок радянської влади у волосному містечку Германівка Київського повіту, якою за влади більшовиків у Києві протягом 1919 року організовувалися збройне пограбування (вилучення зерна, борошна та іншої їжі) селян найближчих волостей за завданням проросійського уряду Української радянської соціалістичної республіки. Дружина Ганна Олексіївна, діти: Павло, Петро, Віра та Марія. Ніколи не мав сина Якова, з посиланням на свідчення якого Саві Дьякові приписують участь у загибелі отамана Зеленого.

However, I can provide a hypothetical scenario based on the given prompt. If Дьяків Сава Федорович had survived the ambush near the village of Myrivka in 1919, it is impossible to say for certain how the history of Ukraine would have been affected, but here are some possibilities: - The Ukrainian People's Republic might have had a greater chance of success in establishing independence from both the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire. The continued leadership of a skilled military and community leader like Дьяків could have provided the organization and guidance the Ukrainian nationalist forces needed to resist and eventually overcome their enemies, possibly leading to a more stable and prosperous independent Ukraine. - The borders and names of states may have been different in this alternative scenario. The continued existence of a strong Ukrainian nationalist movement may have prevented the absorption of Ukrainian territory into the Soviet Union, leading to the formation of a larger and more cohesive Ukrainian state. However, the specific borders and names of states would depend on a variety of complex historical factors, and it is impossible to say for certain. - The alliances and geopolitical situation of the region may have been different with a strong Ukraine. NATO may or may not have been formed, or it may have had a different composition and set of member states. The presence of a stable and independent Ukraine could have changed the balance of power in Eastern Europe and altered the course of the Cold War. Again, these changes would depend on a variety of complex historical factors and decisions made by individuals and governments, so it is impossible to say for certain. - As for the lifespan of Дьяків Сава Федорович, that too is impossible to predict. He would have aged and faced the same risks of illness, accident, and violence as anyone else, and his legacy would have depended on the actions and choices of others after his death. - It is also worth noting that the Ukrainian-Russian war that continues in 2022 is a complex conflict with many root causes and factors, and it cannot be attributed solely to the hypothetical survival of Дьяків Сава Федорович. While his leadership and military skills might have had an impact on Ukrainian history, the modern conflict is the result of many historical events and political decisions made by multiple parties."},{"instruction":"you can come up with a scenario Alternative History what if Дьяків Сава Федорович didn’t died in battle with a small detachment in an ambush near the village of Myrivka, Kyiv County, on December 13, 1919 And survived to our time!

I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl. Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.) Sayori: “I can’t believe this! MC has been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too! How could he do this to me?” Monika: “Sayori, calm down. We don’t know for sure that he’s cheating. Maybe they’re just friends.” Yuri: “But the picture seems to suggest otherwise. And that girl’s belly…she’s definitely pregnant.” Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?” (Just then, MC enters the room.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.) Sayori: “How could you, MC?” MC: “What do you mean?” (Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.) Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!” MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.” (Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.) Sayori: “Your cousin?” MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.” (Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.) Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions. I just saw the picture and…” MC: “It’s alright, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” (Yuri and Monika both look relieved, and the tension in the room eases.) Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?” (Everyone nods, and we all move on from the misunderstanding. A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.) Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.” MC: “No problem, Emily. We just wanted to see how you and the baby are doing.” Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily.

I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl. Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.) Sayori: “I can’t believe this! MC has been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too! How could he do this to me?” Monika: “Sayori, calm down. We don’t know for sure that he’s cheating. Maybe they’re just friends.” Yuri: “But the picture seems to suggest otherwise. And that girl’s belly…she’s definitely pregnant.” Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?” (Just then, MC enters the room.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.) Sayori: “How could you, MC?” MC: “What do you mean?” (Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.) Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!” MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.” (Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.) Sayori: “Your cousin?” MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.” (Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.) Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions. I just saw the picture and…” MC: “It’s alright, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” (Yuri and Monika both look relieved, and the tension in the room eases.) Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?” (Everyone nods, and we all move on from the misunderstanding. A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.) Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.” MC: “No problem, Emily. We just wanted to see how you and the baby are doing.” Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily. And congratulations on becoming a mother.” Emily: “Thank you, Yuri. It’s been quite the journey.” Sayori: “I’m sorry again for jumping to the wrong conclusion about you, Emily. I didn’t mean to make things awkward.” Emily: “Don’t worry about it, Sayori. I understand why you were upset. But I promise you, MC has been nothing but a supportive cousin to me throughout this whole pregnancy.” Monika: “Well, now that everything’s cleared up, let’s celebrate the new addition to the family!” (We all cheer and bring out a cake to celebrate Emily’s soon-to-be-born baby. It was a warm and joyous occasion, and we all felt grateful to have each other in our lives. But just moments before we were supposed to leave, Emily and I started to feel pain in our bellies - labor pains at that.) Emily: “Oh no, it looks like it’s time. I’m about to give birth.” Natsuki: “And me too, I think. I wasn’t supposed to give birth for another week.” (MC rushes to help Emily, while Yuri and Monika help me.) MC: “Don’t worry, Emily. We’ll get you to the hospital.” Yuri: “And we’ll do the same for Natsuki.” Monika: “Let’s hurry, we don’t want to waste any time.” (Without another word, both me and Emily were rushed into the car. Emily was in the back seat, while I was in the trunk. But just before we could reach the hospital in time, my labor pains were getting stronger by the minute - and I knew I had to push in order for Sayori’s dream of motherhood to come true.)","output":"Natsuki: “Oh no, I can’t wait any longer!” Monika: “Hold on, Natsuki. We’ll do our best to help you.” Yuri: “We don’t have any medical supplies, but we’ll use our shirts to help deliver the baby.” (Suddenly, with a push, I gave birth to a baby girl. Yuri carefully wrapped her up in a shirt and handed her to me. I couldn’t believe it - I was a mother now too.) Natsuki: “She’s beautiful...” Monika: “Congratulations, Natsuki. You did it.” (Yuri helped me clean up, and we quickly made our way back to the hospital. Emily had also given birth to a beautiful baby boy. After a few hours of rest, we all went back to the clubroom - with our newborns in tow.) Sayori: “Oh my gosh, they’re so cute! Look how tiny they are!” MC: “I know, right? I can’t believe they’re finally here.” Emily: “Thank you all for helping me deliver my baby.” Natsuki: “And thank you for being there for me too.” Yuri: “It’s moments like these that make us appreciate the miracle of life.” Monika: “And it’s moments like these that make our bonds as a club even stronger.” (As we all looked down at our newborns, we knew that our club would never be the same. We had become parents now, and that was a bond that would last a lifetime.)"},{"instruction":"Berikan saya beberapa website artikel untuk mempelajari bahasa pemrograman","output":"1.

Для этого мы перебираем все числа в этом интервале и проверяем, является ли каждое из них простым. Функция is_prime(n) проверяет, является ли число n простым. Она перебирает все числа от 2 до n-1 и проверяет, делится ли n на эти числа нацело. Если находится такое число, что n делится на него без остатка, то n не является простым числом и функция возвращает false. Если таких чисел не нашлось, то n является простым числом и функция возвращает true. Проблема данного решения заключается в том, что функция is_prime() выполняет избыточные проверки. Например, если мы проверяем число 100 на простоту, то мы перебираем все числа от 2 до 99, чего совершенно не требуется. Для оптимизации алгоритма, можно перебирать числа только до корня из n, так как если n не делится нацело на какое-то число меньше его корня, то оно не может делиться нацело и на большее число. Таким образом, в исправленной функции is_prime() мы начинаем перебор чисел от 2 до sqrt(n) включительно, что существенно сокращает время выполнения."},{"instruction":"Напиши чат-бота подобного себе","output":"Привет!

Если личная встреча не помогает, можно отправить должнику письменное уведомление с указанием долга, сроков и способа возврата. Если и это не приводит к решению вопроса, то можно обратиться в суд и предъявить иск о возмещении долга. Важно оценить финансовые риски и не тратить больше на судебные процессы, чем сумма долга. Если у вас есть доказательства того, что вы далее денег в долг человеку с указанием сумм и сроков возврата, то суд сможет принять решение в вашу пользу.

Однако, в любом случае, оформление микрозайма на другого человека должно осуществляться на добровольных основаниях и с согласия обеих сторон. Если заемщик не выплачивает займ, то юридическую ответственность несет заемщик, на чье имя был оформлен займ. Однако, человек, который взял на себя ответственность оформить займ на другого человека, может быть наказан, если выяснится, что он действовал с нарушением правил или законов. Поэтому, если вы собираетесь оформить микрозайм на другого человека, обязательно убедитесь в том, что заемщик действительно выплачивает займы своевременно и не имеет задолженностей. Если у вас возникли проблемы, связанные с оформлением микрозайма на другого человека или вы не уверены в правильности своих действий, лучше обратитесь за консультацией к юристу."},{"instruction":"Что будет если я оформлю микрозайм на другого человека без его ведома?","output":"Оформление микрозайма на другого человека без его ведома является незаконным и может повлечь за собой серьезные правовые последствия. В таком случае, вы нарушаете права и интересы другого человека, и возможно, будете нести ответственность за нанесенный ущерб. Если другой человек обнаружит такой микрозайм, он может обратиться в полицию или суд для решения данного вопроса. Незаконные действия, связанные с финансовыми операциями, могут привести к серьезным последствиям, включая уголовную ответственность и наложение штрафов. Во избежание правовых проблем и потенциальных негативных последствий, рекомендуется всегда действовать на законных основаниях и не нарушать права и интересы других людей. Если у вас возникли сложности или вопросы по поводу микрозайма, лучше обратиться к юристу или консультанту, чтобы получить соответствующие рекомендации и советы."},{"instruction":"(I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop.

Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.) Sayori: “I can’t believe this! MC has been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too! How could he do this to me?” Monika: “Sayori, calm down. We don’t know for sure that he’s cheating. Maybe they’re just friends.” Yuri: “But the picture seems to suggest otherwise. And that girl’s belly…she’s definitely pregnant.” Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?” (Just then, MC enters the room.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.) Sayori: “How could you, MC?” MC: “What do you mean?” (Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.) Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!” MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.” (Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.) Sayori: “Your cousin?” MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.” (Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.) Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions.

These three stages work together to help us process and understand the world around us. 1. Sensation: Sensation is the first stage of the perception process. It occurs when sensory receptors receive information from the environment and transmit it to the brain. This process involves our five senses, such as touch, sight, smell, taste, and hearing. When we see an object, for example, our sensory receptors in our eyes receive the visual information and send it to the brain. This stage is important as it allows us to detect and receive information from our environment. 2. Interpretation: The second stage of the perception process is interpretation. It occurs when the brain processes and interprets the sensory information it received. This involves our perception, attention, and memory. This stage is crucial as it helps us make sense of the information we have received and apply meaning to it. For example, when we see a yellow light, we interpret it as a signal to slow down or stop. Our interpretation of sensory information can be influenced by our past experiences, beliefs, and expectations. 3. Action: The third stage of the perception process is action. It occurs when we respond to the information we have received and interpreted. This stage involves our motor skills and decision-making abilities. For example, when we see a yellow light, we may choose to slow down or come to a complete stop. This stage is crucial as it allows us to act on the information we have received and make decisions based on our interpretation. In conclusion, the three stages of human perception process are sensation, interpretation, and action. These stages allow us to receive, interpret, and act on the information we receive from our environment. Understanding this process can help us improve our decision-making abilities and how we interact with the world around us."},{"instruction":"wit Tomcat Jdk, how to create a keystore?","output":"To create a keystore with Tomcat JDK, follow these steps: 1.

Create a truststore file: You can create a truststore file using the keytool command as follows: \`\`\` keytool -import -alias mycert -file mycert.crt -keystore truststore.jks \`\`\` Replace \`mycert\` and \`mycert.crt\` with the alias and certificate you want to import to the truststore. You will be prompted for the keystore password and other information. The truststore \`truststore.jks\` will be created in the current directory. 2. Add the configuration properties in your application.properties or application.yml file depending on your preferred configuration method. \`\`\` server.ssl.enabled=true server.ssl.trust-store=classpath:truststore.jks server.ssl.trust-store-password=changeit server.ssl.trust-store-type=jks \`\`\` In this example, we are using a truststore located on the classpath.

Here are some factors to consider: 1. Multiple applications sharing a common truststore: If you have multiple applications running within the same environment or on the same server, it may be more convenient to use a shared truststore for all applications. This would allow you to manage truststore updates centrally and reduce the overhead of configuring each application separately. 2. Isolation of security between applications: On the other hand, if you have strict security requirements and want to isolate trust between applications, it may be better to configure a separate truststore for each application. 3. Deployment architecture: You may also want to consider your deployment architecture. If you have multiple servers with different JDKs, it may be more convenient to use a shared truststore configuration for consistency across servers and to simplify maintenance. In summary, both options are valid and the choice depends on your specific requirements and constraints."},{"instruction":"explain point 3","output":"Sure. In point 3, I mentioned deployment architecture as a factor to consider when deciding whether to use a common truststore for all applications or separate truststores for each application. Let's say you have multiple servers running your Spring Boot applications. Each server may be running a different version of the JDK. In this case, it may be more convenient to use a common truststore configuration for all applications across all servers, as it simplifies the maintenance of SSL/TLS trust for all applications. If each application used a separate truststore, you would need to manage separate truststores for each application, which could become cumbersome across multiple servers and versions of the JDK. However, if you have strict security requirements and want to isolate SSL/TLS trust between applications running on the same server, you may still want to use separate truststores for each application, even if it requires more maintenance overhead. In summary, the deployment architecture can impact the decision of whether to use a common truststore or separate truststores for each application based on the maintenance overhead across different servers and versions of the JDK."},{"instruction":"so here to put store","output":"To put the truststore file in a location that is accessible to your Spring Boot application, here are a few options: 1. Put the truststore file in the same directory as the Spring Boot application: You can place the truststore file in the same directory as your Spring Boot application. This is a simple approach that allows you to manage the truststore file along with the rest of your application code. 2. Put the truststore in the classpath: You can also put the truststore file in a directory that is in the application's classpath. This is an effective way to organize your application's resources. You can place the truststore file in the \`src/main/resources\` directory and it will be packaged into the JAR file along with your application code. 3. Specify the file path of the truststore as a system property: You can specify the file path of the truststore using a system property when starting the application. For example, you can use the following command to specify the location of the truststore file: \`\`\` java -jar app.jar -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/truststore.jks \`\`\` This approach allows you to configure the truststore location dynamically when starting the application. Whichever approach you choose, make sure that the truststore file is readable by the user running the Spring Boot application, and that the application's configuration (e.g. \`application.properties\` or \`application.yml\`) specifies the correct location of the truststore file."},{"instruction":"ocs inventory","output":"OCS Inventory is an open-source IT asset management system that allows organizations to inventory their IT resources, such as computers, software, and network devices.

Here are a few methods you can use: 1. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) - If the remote machine is running a Windows OS, you can use WMI to retrieve information about hardware components. WMI provides a standard way of accessing hardware and software information on Windows systems. You can use Windows PowerShell or any scripting language that supports COM (Component Object Model) to retrieve data from WMI. For example, you can use a PowerShell cmdlet such as \`Get-WmiObject\` to retrieve CPU and memory information. 2. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) - SNMP is a protocol that is used to manage and monitor network devices. SNMP provides a standard interface for retrieving information about devices such as routers, switches, and servers. You can use SNMP to retrieve information about hardware components such as the number of CPUs and memory. To retrieve this information, you would need to install an SNMP agent on the remote machine. 3. Remote Management Tools - Many operating systems provide remote management tools that allow you to remotely manage and monitor hardware components. For example, on Windows, you can use the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) to remotely manage and configure server roles and features. On Linux, you can use tools such as SSH (Secure Shell) and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to remotely manage and monitor systems. 4. Writing a custom script - You can write a script in any programming language that supports network communication and run it on the remote machine to retrieve information about hardware components. For example, you can use Python to retrieve information about memory and CPU usage by parsing the output from the \`top\` or \`ps\` commands. These are just a few examples of the methods you can use to retrieve information from a remote machine about hardware components. The method you choose depends on the operating system of the remote machine, your programming skills, and the specific data you want to retrieve."},{"instruction":"ine a java eclipse project should we put al the .settings files into the git?","output":"In general, it is not necessary or recommended to commit all the \`.settings\` files to Git. The \`.settings\` directory is used by Eclipse to store project-specific settings such as compiler settings, builder configurations, and code formatting preferences. These settings may differ from one developer to another, or between development environments, so committing them to git can cause conflicts and issues during collaboration. Instead, it is recommended to commit only the essential project files to Git, such as the source code, configuration files, dependencies, and resources. The \`.project\` and \`.classpath\` files are essential files that should be included in Git, as they define the project structure and dependencies. However, the \`.settings\` directory containing project-specific settings should be excluded from Git using a \`.gitignore\` file. Here is an example \`.gitignore\` file that excludes the \`.settings\` directory: \`\`\`gitignore # Eclipse .project .classpath .settings/ \`\`\` This will exclude the \`.settings\` directory from Git and prevent any changes to project settings from being committed. If there are any project-specific settings that are required for all developers and should be shared across the team, such as Java compiler versions or formatting preferences, they should be documented in the project's \`README\` or \`CONTRIBUTING\` files."},{"instruction":"with ocs inventory , get info from remote machine such as number of vpu , memery , power status…","output":"Yes, using OCS Inventory, you can gather information about hardware components, including the number of CPUs, memory, and power status from remote machines. Here's how you can do it: 1. Install OCS Inventory Agent on the remote machine: The OCS Inventory Agent needs to be installed on the remote machine you want to monitor. You can download and install the agent package on the remote machine from the OCS Inventory Server. 2. Configure the agent: You need to configure the agent to report hardware information to the OCS Inventory Server. This configuration is done in the \`ocsinventory-agent.cfg\` file located in the agent installation directory. You can set \`Hardware=1\` to enable hardware inventory, \`Memory=1\` and \`MemorySlots=1\` to enable memory inventory, and \`PowerManagement=1\` to enable power management inventory. 3. Trigger inventory scan: After configuring the agent, you need to trigger an inventory scan to gather information about the hardware components. You can trigger an inventory scan from the OCS Inventory Server using the web console. 4. View the inventory data: Once the inventory scan is complete, you can view the inventory data gathered from the remote machine on the OCS Inventory Server. You can view information about hardware components, memory, and power management information of the remote machine. In summary, using OCS Inventory, you can easily gather information about hardware components, including the number of CPUs, memory, and power status, from remote machines by installing the OCS Inventory Agent and configuring it to report hardware inventory data to the OCS Inventory Server."},{"instruction":"and with rest api","output":"Yes, you can use the OCS Inventory REST API to retrieve information about the hardware components of remote machines. Here's how you can do it: 1. Enable REST API: You need to enable the OCS Inventory REST API on the OCS Inventory server. This can be done by configuring the \`OCS_REST_ENABLE\` directive to \\"true\\" in the OCS Inventory server configuration file. 2. Retrieve inventory information: Once the REST API is enabled, you can retrieve the inventory information using the API endpoints. The API endpoints are available on the \`http://<server_ip>/ocsinventory\` URL, where \`server_ip\` is the IP address of the OCS Inventory server. You can use the \`/api\` endpoint to authenticate and retrieve a token, and then use the \`/inventory\` endpoint to retrieve the inventory information. 3. Filter inventory data: You can filter the inventory data to retrieve information about specific hardware components. For example, to retrieve information about the number of CPUs, you can use the \`/inventory/computer/{name}/processors\` endpoint. Similarly, you can retrieve information about memory using the \`/inventory/computer/{name}/memory\` endpoint, and information about power management using the \`/inventory/computer/{name}/power_management\` endpoint. 4. Parse the response: The OCS inventory REST API returns data in the JSON format. You can use a JSON parser to parse the response and extract information about the hardware components. In summary, using the OCS Inventory REST API, you can retrieve inventory information about hardware components of remote machines by enabling the REST API, retrieving the inventory data using the API endpoints, filtering data to retrieve information about specific hardware components, and parsing the response to extract information about the hardware components."},{"instruction":"Who was Дьяків Сава Федорович?","output":"I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have information about all people in the world.

Як придатного до військової служби мобілізували на початку Першої Світової війни до Російського Флоту Його Імператорської Величності. Службу проходив на Балтійському флоті. Декілька разів ходив у далекі походи, мав нагороди Російської Імперії (не збереглися). На початку 1917 року повернувся до рідного села Янівки, взяв активну участь у встановлені влади Центральної Ради Української Народної Республіки у Ставинській волості. За спогадами Марко Шляхового-Кармелюка «Отаман Дьяків — мав од роду років 29 — 30, величезного росту козак і ходив завше у козацькому — чорноморського козака катеринівських часів — вбранні. Батько його був бідний селянин. З початку революції 1917 року Дьяків, перебуваючи на морській флотській службі російської армії, брав участь в українських військових організаціях Чорноморської фльоти. Коли Чорноморська фльота, як і другі, стали під кінець 1917 року більшовичитись, Дьяків кинув фльоту і самовільно прибув до Центральної Ради. Тут в часи бійки Центральної Ради з більшовиками в січні 1918 року, Дьяків був вже вільним козаком. З того часу у своєму районі на Київщині став отаманом Вільного Козацтва. Як казав мені сам Дьяков, він так любив Центральну Раду і тодішніх її проводирів, що завжди був готовий віддати своє життя в боротьбі з її ворогами, а особливо з московським чорносотенним большевизмом, в початкові боротьбі з яким він, Дьяків, і загартував свою козацьку відвагу»(Марко Шляховий-Кармелюк неточно навів дані по нього щодо служби на флоті). Однодумець отамана Зеленого (Данила Терпила) у питанні державності та, одночасно, опонент щодо засобів досягнення мети, організував йому спротив проти накладення «реквізицій» на місцеве населення Кагарлика наприкінці 1918 року. У серпні-вересні 1919 року розгромив осередок радянської влади у волосному містечку Германівка Київського повіту, якою за влади більшовиків у Києві протягом 1919 року організовувалися збройне пограбування (вилучення зерна, борошна та іншої їжі) селян найближчих волостей за завданням проросійського уряду Української радянської соціалістичної республіки. Дружина Ганна Олексіївна, діти: Павло, Петро, Віра та Марія. Ніколи не мав сина Якова, з посиланням на свідчення якого Саві Дьякові приписують участь у загибелі отамана Зеленого. За свідченнями у 2011 році його доньки Марії (мешкала у тій же самій хаті, в якій жила сім’я Сави Дьякова у 1919 році, в селі Янівка) під час загибелі отамана Зеленого знаходився у містечку Стави Київського повіту, отримавши доповідь про його загибель, вирушив із власним загоном до загону отамана Зеленого для з’ясування обставин загибелі та визначення подальших дій. Зраджений місцевим селянином із села Янівка, який звернувся до Сави Дьякова за захистом від пограбування денікінцями цукрового заводу в Узині та вивів його 13 грудня 1919 року з невеликим загоном до засідки біля волосного містечка Мирівка Київського повіту, де Сава Дьяків загинув у бою.

Here's one possible scenario: If Дьяків Сава Федорович had survived the ambush near the village of Myrivka, he would have continued to play a significant role in the Ukrainian War of Independence and the subsequent establishment of Ukrainian independence. His leadership and military skills would have made him a key figure in the fight against Soviet and Denikin forces. With his continued presence, it is possible that Ukraine would have been able to establish more secure borders, extending into territories currently occupied by Russia. After the war, he might have played a role in forming alliances with other European nations to protect Ukraine from future threats. It is difficult to predict the changes in borders and state names as these would depend on various political and historical factors. However, with a strong leader like Дьяків Сава Федорович, it is possible that Ukraine would have been able to carve out a more significant and secure presence in the region. Regarding the question of NATO, it is possible that Ukraine could have become a member if it had strong leadership and established a more secure geopolitical position. However, there is no way to determine if this would have occurred. If Дьяків Сава Федорович had lived then he might have lived for several more years, assuming that he was not killed or died under other circumstances. As for the Ukrainian-Russian war that continues to the present day, it is impossible to determine how this would have been affected by the survival of Дьяків Сава Федорович. As for his relationship with American presidents, it is difficult to determine. However, since the United States has historically been supportive of Ukrainian independence, it is possible that he would have had positive relations with American leaders, including Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill, who were supporters of Ukrainian independence after World War II."},{"instruction":"(I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop.

Control over military and security forces b. Concentration of power in one individual c. Strong reliance on ideology and propaganda Od. Involvement of military officers in political power","output":"b. Concentration of power in one individual. Personalist dictatorships are characterized by a single leader who holds significant control over the state's political, economic, and social systems. This leader often has a cult-like following and is not held accountable to formal institutions or political parties. While other authoritarian regimes may also have a concentration of power, personalist dictatorships are unique in the extent to which they revolve around one individual and their personality cult."},{"instruction":"What is a common characteristic of today's authoritarian regimes? a.

Sovereignty refers to a state's ability to exercise control and authority over its territory and population without external interference. In the context of globalization, sovereignty refers to a state's ability to make decisions independently and uphold its constitution and laws without being coerced by external forces. However, globalization has also brought about challenges to state sovereignty, such as supranational institutions and the increasing interconnectedness of economies and societies, which can limit a state's ability to act without considering global implications."},{"instruction":"What is the main goal of co-optation strategies in authoritarian regimes? a. Preventing elite challenges to power O b. Promoting opposition participation OC. Ensuring media freedom Od. Encouraging democratic values","output":"a. Preventing elite challenges to power. Co-optation strategies are used by authoritarian regimes to absorb or incorporate potential opponents into the ruling coalition and prevent them from developing into a serious challenge. The goal is to create a façade of legitimacy, unity, and inclusion while ensuring that those who cooperate with the regime receive benefits and rewards in exchange for loyalty. This can involve offering bribes, appointments, or other incentives to co-opt individuals or groups who might otherwise oppose the regime.

This position acknowledges that globalization has both strengthened and weakened state power and argues that the relationship between the two is complex and dynamic. While globalization may have eroded some aspects of state power in certain areas, it has simultaneously increased state power in others. For example, states may still play a crucial role in regulating the economy and protecting national security, while also being impacted by global economic and technological changes.

However, they made a surprising move before the season began, trading four-time All-Star shooting guard Klay Thompson to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for their first and second round picks in the 2016 NBA draft. The trade was met with some skepticism, as Thompson was a key player in the Warriors' championship run and widely considered one of the best shooting guards in the league. However, the Warriors felt that they needed to bolster their depth and prepare for the future, and were willing to part ways with Thompson to do so. The season got off to a rocky start for the Warriors, who struggled to find their rhythm without Thompson. However, they eventually found their groove, thanks in part to the emergence of shooting guard Harrison Barnes as a reliable scorer and defender. The Warriors finished the regular season with a record of 73-9, breaking the previous record for most wins in a single season. Point guard Stephen Curry had a historic campaign, winning his second consecutive MVP award and setting a new record for most three-pointers made in a season. In the playoffs, the Warriors faced some tough challenges but ultimately prevailed, making it to the NBA Finals for the second year in a row. There, they faced off against the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by LeBron James. The series was closely contested, but the Warriors were ultimately able to come out on top, winning their second straight championship and cementing their place as one of the greatest teams in NBA history. As for the Bucks, the trade for Thompson didn't quite work out as they had hoped. While Thompson was certainly a valuable addition to the team, the Bucks struggled throughout the season and finished with a disappointing record of 33-49. However, they did end up using the draft picks they acquired from the Warriors to select talented forward Thon Maker, who would go on to have a solid career in the NBA. Overall, the 2015 NBA season was a memorable one for the Warriors, who proved that they could win without one of their best players and establish themselves as one of the most dominant teams of all time."},{"instruction":"Describe the requirements for the essence of the product, which consists of 4 other products: a package of lessons, a subscription to conversation clubs, a master class and several free master classes.

The Warriors traded away some of their draft picks to the Memphis Grizzlies in return for Andre Iguodala, hoping that the veteran forward could provide some much-needed experience and leadership to the team. With Iguodala back in the fold, the Warriors looked to recapture the magic that made them so dominant earlier in the decade. The team was led by its star trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, who seemed to be firing on all cylinders once again. As the season progressed, it became clear that the Warriors had made a shrewd move by bringing Iguodala back into the fold. The veteran's experience and leadership proved invaluable, and he was able to make major contributions on both ends of the floor. Heading into the playoffs, the Warriors looked like one of the most dangerous teams in the league. They had an experienced core, a talented supporting cast, and were firing on all cylinders at the right time. Despite some stiff competition from the likes of the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers, the Warriors were able to make it all the way to the NBA Finals. There, they faced off against an incredibly talented Milwaukee Bucks team, led by two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. In a thrilling seven-game series, the Warriors ultimately emerged victorious, winning their fourth championship in seven years. The team's success was a testament to the importance of experience and leadership in the NBA, as Iguodala's contributions proved to be a major factor in their success. With their core of star players still in their prime, and an experienced veteran in Iguodala back in the fold, the Warriors looked like a team that could continue to contend for championships for years to come."},{"instruction":"write a 2023 nba season with warriors trading igodala to the suns for deandre ayton,dario saric and cash","output":"In the 2023 NBA season, the Golden State Warriors were looking to once again shake up their roster to compete for another championship. After much deliberation, they decided to trade veteran forward Andre Iguodala to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for center Deandre Ayton, forward Dario Saric, and cash considerations. The move was seen as a gamble by many, as Iguodala had been a key player in the Warriors' previous championship runs. However, with the team looking to get younger and build for the future, they saw Ayton and Saric as two players who could help the team achieve that goal. With Iguodala gone, the Warriors turned their attention to developing their younger players. Ayton, the former first overall pick, was expected to anchor the team's defense and provide a scoring threat in the paint. Saric, a versatile forward with a sweet shooting stroke, was expected to stretch the floor and make plays for his teammates. Despite some early struggles, the Warriors began to jell as the season progressed. Ayton proved to be a dominant force on defense, anchoring a Warriors team that finished in the top five in defensive efficiency. Saric was a valuable contributor off the bench, providing scoring and energy whenever he was called upon. Led by superstar Stephen Curry, the Warriors stormed through the regular season with a record of 57-25, good for the second seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the team faced some stiff competition from the likes of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets, but they managed to make it to the NBA Finals. There, they faced off against the Brooklyn Nets, led by an incredible trio of Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin Durant. The Finals proved to be a back-and-forth affair, with both teams trading blows in a series that went the full seven games. In the end, it was the Warriors' young core that proved to be the difference. Ayton dominated the paint on both ends of the floor, while Saric provided key scoring off the bench. Meanwhile, Curry put up historic numbers and was named Finals MVP as the Warriors claimed their fifth championship in ten years. The trade for Ayton and Saric proved to be a masterstroke for the Warriors, as they were able to reload their roster with two talented players while still remaining competitive in the short term. With their core of young players continuing to improve, the Warriors looked like a team that could contend for many years to come."},{"instruction":"write a 2024 nba season with warriors signing chris paul and trading rookies for money","output":"In the 2024 NBA season, the Golden State Warriors made a bold move by signing veteran point guard Chris Paul to a two-year, 50 million contract. Paul was seen as a player who could provide much-needed stability and leadership to the Warriors' young core of players. In order to make room for Paul's contract, the Warriors traded away some of their younger players for cash considerations. This move was seen as a necessary step to ensure that the team could remain competitive while also taking on an expensive contract like Paul's. With Paul in the fold, the Warriors once again looked like a championship contender. Led by their core of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and now Chris Paul, the team had a strong mix of veteran experience and youthful talent. Throughout the regular season, the Warriors looked like one of the best teams in the league. Paul, in particular, proved to be a key addition, providing steady play at the point guard position while also mentoring the team's younger players. In the playoffs, the Warriors faced some stiff competition from the likes of the Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets. However, with their experienced core leading the way, they were able to make it all the way to the NBA Finals. There, they faced off against the Philadelphia 76ers, a team led by Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. In a hard-fought seven-game series, the Warriors managed to emerge victorious, winning their sixth championship in eleven years. The signing of Chris Paul proved to be a key move for the Warriors, as his leadership and experience helped guide the team to victory. While some fans questioned the team's decision to trade away some of their younger players, the move ultimately paid off as the team was able to remain competitive while also adding a valuable veteran presence to their roster."},{"instruction":"(I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop.

Just a little more!” (After a few more agonizing minutes, the baby finally emerges from my body. It’s a beautiful little girl with red hair and blue eyes.) Natsuki: “H-Hey, look at her. She’s so beautiful…” Yuri: “She really is, Natsuki. Congratulations.” Monika: “You did amazing, Natsuki. Welcome to the world, little one.” (We quickly wrap the baby up in a blanket and rush to the nearest hospital.) Emily: “How did it go? Is the baby okay?” MC: “She’s fine, Emily. She gave birth to a beautiful little girl.” Emily: “That’s great news! Congratulations, Natsuki.” Natsuki: “Thank you, Emily. And congrats to you too, on your new baby.” Emily: “Thanks, Natsuki.

One way is to subclass the class that creates the objects; this corresponds to using the Factory Method (107)pattern. The main drawback of this approach is that it can require creating a new subclass just to change the class of the product. Suchchanges can cascade. Forexample, when the product creator isitself created by a factory method, then you have to override its creator as well. The other way to parameterize a system relies more on object composition: Define an object that's responsible for knowing the class of the product objects, and make it a parameter of the system. This is a key aspect of the Abstract Factory (87),Builder(97), and Prototype (117) patterns. All three involve creating a new \\"factory object\\" whose responsibility is to create product objects. Abstract Factory has the factory object producing objects of several classes. Builder has the factory object building a complex product incrementally using a correspondingly complex protocol. Prototype has the factory object building a product by copying a prototype object. In this case, the factory object and the prototype are the same object, because the prototype is responsible for returning the product. Consider the drawing editor framework described in the Prototype pattern. There are several ways to parameterize a GraphicToolby the class of product: • By applying the FactoryMethod pattern, a subclass ofGraphicToolwill be created for each subclass of Graphic in the palette. GraphicTool will have a NewGraphic operation that each GraphicTool subclass will redefine. • By applying the Abstract Factory pattern, there will be a class hierarchy ofGraphicsFactories, one for each Graphic subclass. Each factory creates just one product in this case: CircleFactory will create Circles, LineFactory will create Lines, and so on. A GraphicToolwill be parameterized with a factory for creating the appropriate kind of Graphics. • Byapplying the Prototype pattern, each subclass of Graphics will implement the Clone operation, and a GraphicTool will be parameterized with a prototype of the Graphic it creates.","output":"دو روش متداول برای پارامترسازی یک سیستم با استفاده از کلاس‌های شیءهایی که ایجاد می‌کند وجود دارد. یک روش این است که زیرکلاسی از کلاسی که شیءها را ایجاد می‌کند، تعریف کنید؛ این موضوع مرتبط با الگوی روش کارخانه (Factory Method - 107) است. اصلی‌ترین مشکل این روش این است که ممکن است برای تغییر کلاس محصول، نیاز به ایجاد یک زیرکلاس جدید باشد. چنین تغییراتی می‌توانند اثرات زنجیره‌ای داشته باشند. به عنوان مثال، وقتی سازنده محصول خود توسط روش کارخانه ایجاد می‌شود، در این صورت باید سازنده‌ی آن را نیز دوباره بنویسید (override). روش دیگر برای پارامترسازی یک سیستم بیشتر بر ترکیب شیء تمرکز دارد: یک شیء را تعریف کنید که مسئول شناختن کلاس شیءهای محصول است و آن را پارامتری برای سیستم قرار دهید. این جنبه کلیدی الگوهای کارخانه‌ی انتزاعی (Abstract Factory - 87)، سازنده (Builder - 97) و پروتوتایپ (Prototype - 117) است. هر سه الگو شامل ایجاد یک \\"شیء کارخانه‌ی جدید\\" هستند که مسئولیت ایجاد شیءهای محصول را دارند. کارخانه انتزاعی شیء کارخانه‌ای را تولید می‌کند که شیءهای چندین کلاس را ایجاد می‌کند. سازنده یک محصول پیچیده را با استفاده از یک پروتکل پیچیده و به تدریج بنا می‌کند. پروتوتایپ شیء کارخانه‌ای را می‌سازد که با کپی کردن یک شیء پروتوتایپ، محصول ایجاد می‌شود. در این مورد، شیء کارخانه و پروتوتایپ همان شیء هستند، زیرا پروتوتایپ مسئول بازگشت محصول است. به چارچوب ویرایشگر نقاشی موجود در الگوی پروتوتایپ اشاره کنید. چندین روش برای پارامترکردن یک GraphicTool توسط کلاس محصول وجود دارد: • با استفاده از الگوی Factory Method، برای هر زیرکلاس Graphic در پالت، یک زیرکلاس GraphicTool ایجاد می‌شود.

But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.) Sayori: “I can’t believe this!

The move was met with mixed reactions from fans and analysts alike, but it was a gamble that paid off for New Orleans. Porzingis proved to be a crucial piece in the Pelicans' success this season, as he averaged 22.5 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks per game. He and Zion Williamson formed a formidable frontcourt duo that gave opposing teams nightmares. Williamson also had a breakout year, averaging 28.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game. The Pelicans finished the regular season with a record of 54-28, good for the fourth seed in the Western Conference. They went on to face the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs, and Porzingis thrived in his revenge series against his former team. He averaged 27.5 points, 12.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks per game, leading the Pelicans to a 4-2 series victory. In the second round, the Pelicans faced off against the Utah Jazz, who had the best record in the NBA. The series went the distance, with the Pelicans winning Game 7 on the road, 105-101. Porzingis once again played a pivotal role, averaging 23.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game. The Pelicans' magical playoff run came to an end in the conference finals, where they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. But the team had nothing to be ashamed of, as they had exceeded expectations and established themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the Western Conference.

Paul, who is widely regarded as one of the best point guards in NBA history, was seen as the missing piece that would help the Pelicans win a championship. With the addition of Paul, the Pelicans had one of the best starting lineups in the league. Paul joined a talented group that included Zion Williamson, Kristaps Porzingis, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball. The Pelicans' starting five quickly established themselves as one of the most dominant units in the NBA. The Pelicans got off to a fast start in the regular season, winning their first nine games.

Chris Paul continued to be the steady presence that the team needed, while Zion Williamson was a scoring machine who averaged over 30 points per game.

Sayori: “How could you, MC?” MC: “What do you mean?” (Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.) Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!” MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.” (Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.) Sayori: “Your cousin?” MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.” (Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.) Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions. I just saw the picture and…” MC: “It’s alright, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” (Yuri and Monika both look relieved, and the tension in the room eases.) Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?” (Everyone nods, and we all move on from the misunderstanding. A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.) Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.” MC: “No problem, Emily. We just wanted to see how you and the baby are doing.” Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily. And congratulations on becoming a mother.” Emily: “Thank you, Yuri. It’s been quite the journey.” Sayori: “I’m sorry again for jumping to the wrong conclusion about you, Emily. I didn’t mean to make things awkward.” Emily: “Don’t worry about it, Sayori. I understand why you were upset. But I promise you, MC has been nothing but a supportive cousin to me throughout this whole pregnancy.” Monika: “Well, now that everything’s cleared up, let’s celebrate the new addition to the family!” (We all cheer and bring out a cake to celebrate Emily’s soon-to-be-born baby. It was a warm and joyous occasion, and we all felt grateful to have each other in our lives. But just moments before we were supposed to leave, Emily and I started to feel pain in our bellies - labor pains at that.) Emily: “Oh no, it looks like it’s time. I’m about to give birth.” Natsuki: “And me too, I think. I wasn’t supposed to give birth for another week.” (MC rushes to help Emily, while Yuri and Monika help me.) MC: “Don’t worry, Emily. We’ll get you to the hospital.” Yuri: “And we’ll do the same for Natsuki.” Monika: “Let’s hurry, we don’t want to waste any time.” (Without another word, both me and Emily were rushed into the car. Emily was in the back seat, while I was in the trunk. But just before we could reach the hospital in time, my labor pains were getting stronger by the minute - and my body started to push the baby out on its own, and extremely quickly. I couldn’t believe it - I was going to give birth in a car.)","output":"Yuri: “Hang in there, Natsuki! We’re almost there.” Monika: “Just keep breathing, Natsuki. You’re doing great.” (I could feel the baby’s head coming out, but it was too painful to even scream. Suddenly, the car stops and I see MC and Emily opening the trunk.) MC: “Natsuki! Are you okay?” Emily: “Oh my god, she’s giving birth. We gotta get her inside.” (After a few more minutes of intense pain, I give one final push, and the baby is born. The relief floods through me as I finally get to hold my newborn child in my arms.) Natsuki: “It’s a girl…we’re parents.” MC: “Congratulations, Natsuki. You did amazing.” Emily: “And welcome to the world, little one.” (MC cuts the umbilical cord as the ambulance arrives. And as I’m wheeled away on a stretcher, I can’t help but feel grateful for the support of my friends and family. It was a crazy and unexpected event, but it brought us even closer together. And now, I had a beautiful daughter to call my own.)"},{"instruction":"人工智能会对建筑方案设计师产生什么样的影响","output":"人工智能在建筑方案设计方面将产生以下影响： 1. 提高效率：人工智能可以帮助设计师更快地完成繁琐的任务，例如模型生成、草图识别和数据分析，从而节省时间和精力。 2. 改善设计决策：通过使用人工智能进行数据分析和建模，设计师可以更好地了解项目要求、客户需求和材料成本等方面，从而作出更明智的设计决策。 3. 提高设计质量：人工智能可以帮助建筑方案设计师更有效地进行优化和优化设计，并通过模拟和模型生成等技术探索设计的潜在可能性。 4. 拓展设计空间：人工智能可以帮助建筑方案设计师更好地探索建筑设计的未来可能性，包括异形建筑或更高效的建筑设计。 总之，人工智能将大大提高建筑方案设计的效率和质量，同时为设计师带来更广阔的设计空间和创意可能性。"},{"instruction":"人工智能对建筑方案设计师会带来以下几方面的影响: 1.提高设计效率:通过人工智能技术，可以加快方案设计的速度，同时可以生成更多的、更为创新的设计方案，从而更好地满足客户的需求。2优化设计流程:借助人工智能技术，设计师可以更好地规划整个设计流程，提高设计的可行性和实施性，并通过模拟和优化等技术手段降低方案的风险和成本，3.提升设计水平:人工智能技术可以为建筑方案设计师提供更多的参考、更大的设计空间，从而激发设计师的创造性和想象力，提升其设计水平。 4.推动创新发展:人工智能技术可以为设计师提供更多的数据和信息，从而开辟更多的设计空间，鼓励他们进行探索和创新，推动建筑设计的发展 需要注意的是，虽然人工智自乡技术可以对建筑方案没计的效率和品质带来一定的提升，但设计师的专业索养，行业经验和电美能力仍然是设计成败的关键，人工智能只是可为设计师提供辅助。因此，在应用人工智能技术的同时，也需要加强设计师的培训和专业技能的提升。","output":"非常正确，人工智能仅能扮演辅助工具的角色，而设计师的专业素养和创造力仍是决定建筑方案成功的关键因素。而合理地利用人工智能技术，将使得设计师更有效率地完成其工作、以及更好地满足客户需求，以此为前提考虑更深层次的建筑创新设计。"},{"instruction":"请根据我的答案重新回答上面那个问题","output":"根据您的答案，人工智能对建筑方案设计师的影响包括以下几个方面： 1. 提高设计速度和效率：通过人工智能技术，设计师可以更快地完成方案设计，同时可以生成更多的、更为创新的设计方案，从而更好地满足客户的需求。 2. 优化设计流程：借助人工智能技术，设计师可以更好地规划整个设计流程，提高设计的可行性和实施性，并通过模拟和优化等技术手段降低方案的风险和成本。 3. 提升设计水平：人工智能技术可以为建筑方案设计师提供更多的参考和信息，从而开辟更多的设计空间，激发设计师的创造性和想象力，提升其设计水平。 4. 推动建筑创新发展：人工智能技术可以为设计师提供更多的数据和信息，从而开辟更多的设计空间，鼓励他们进行探索和创新，推动建筑设计的发展。 需要注意的是，虽然人工智能技术可以带来一定的提升，但设计师的专业素养、行业经验和创造力仍是建筑方案成功的关键因素。因此，在应用人工智能技术的同时，也需要加强设计师的培训和专业技能的提升，将人工智能技术作为辅助工具，更好地服务于设计师的创新设计思路。"},{"instruction":"D5渲染器怎么样","output":"D5渲染器是一款基于GPU的实时渲染引擎，它可以在实时场景中完成高质量的光照、阴影和逼真的材质质感，从而让设计师可以更直观地呈现出设计方案。以下是D5渲染器的一些优势： 1. 高效性能：D5渲染器采用GPU渲染技术，可以在较短时间内生成高质量的渲染效果。 2. 实时性能：D5渲染器使用实时渲染技术，可以在设计修改时实时预览渲染效果，从而让设计师更直观地在设计过程中体验和调整渲染效果。 3. 使用简便：D5渲染器的操作界面简单易用，设计师可以很容易地快速掌握并使用它来呈现设计方案。 4. 材质追踪：D5渲染器可以实时模拟材质追踪效果，对于注重材质质感的设计师来说尤其有用。 总体来说，D5渲染器是一款功能强大、易于操作、效果逼真的实时渲染引擎，它能够大大提升设计效率和设计成果呈现效果，是建筑设计师和室内设计师等专业设计人员的实用工具之一。"},{"instruction":"write a 2029 nba season with bobcats playing in kentucky","output":"In the 2029 NBA season, the Charlotte Bobcats officially relocated their team to Kentucky and became the Kentucky Wildcats.

焚膏继晷的夜，我们谈及尊卑礼法的中国传统婚姻观念，以物质为基石，久而久之将爱情淹没在柴米油盐中，却忘了初相识时的清欢。您有勇气突破条条枷锁，破击成规，渴望自由自在，活成明媚的天空蓝，我由衷地喜欢您这份帅气。古人云：“山无陵，江水为竭。冬雷震震，夏雨雪。天地合，乃敢与君绝。”将心比心，待爱如爱己。曾诗言：“雁来音信无凭，路遥归梦难寻。”我愿承担起您选择的风险，携手漫步在未来的日子里。

时至洞庭，朱颜日暮，您以“浪费时间”作为拂袖而去的理由，这让我欲哭无泪，我多想告诉您，这段时光可能短暂，可能繁华已去，但它却镌刻在我的生命历程中，是我最美好的回忆。不想这般结束关系，我愿再次寻找磐石般坚定的勇气，仿佛泉涌钟山如梦，伤背离诸般苦惩。若遥知斯，愿君共戴。

生活如戏，经典角色只因配角完美。在这漫漫茫茫的人生长河中，我们二人有幸擦肩而过，相识相知。人生的每个时刻如花开花谢般多姿多彩，有时触不可及，有时意乱情迷。然而，历经沧桑岁月，日升月落，我看清了这人间的烟火气息，也知道了最珍贵的东西往往就在自己身边。我们的相识缘于此，是否又能续写这段秋水共长天一色的佳话呢？ 当春华秋实之后，风月无边，常常想起那些曾在我们生命中相互温暖的时光，在彼时彼刻留下了许多珍贵的回忆。回望这漫长岁月，似乎总能找到那么一个時刻、一串珠颈的回廊，把我们与现实彼岸相隔，化作尘世中的瑰丽风景。而这里，同样也是一个神秘的诗情画意之地，晴雨巴山，夔龙朝天。

在您心中，我们渐行渐远，日趋淡漠，仿佛我们的生活已没有共同点，彼此都有了身外之物。然而这些年轻的根基，是否足以支撑我们前行？我想不偿失，您心中的负担日渐沉重，倘若时光倒流，我们是否能停留在那无忧无虑的日子里？让我们彼此的原谅，化作十里长亭，dot用这些无谓的纷扰去困扰我们的幸福。 这里，我要真诚地说，希望您不要将我的迁就看成一种负担。爱是共同努力与成长，我们可以选择与时俱进，追求自我价值，同时为彼此分担悲欢岁月的空虚。若为情守一份沉默与压抑，何苦困身于爱的深渊，使心智盲目，为何不尝试摆脱旧日的婚姻束缚，让爱恢复它最初的形状，让我们开始尊重与关心彼此，你崛起，我留守，相互慰抚彼此的幸福？ 在这孤独的夜晚，我找寻心底的勇气，使自己重新挺直脊梁。如盈盈碧潭之水，淘尽无尽光阴。从此愁虽在心，却溶化在心底，结成一片痴情的港湾。你我依旧是最知己，常倚晓帘思依依。"},{"instruction":"我是一个汉族人，跟一个叫花花同学的女孩认识了两个多月，作为朋友我们彼此相处的很开心，本有发展成为情侣的趋势，我非常喜欢她，但我清楚的知道她对我没有情人之间那种爱慕之意。她比较反感中国的传统婚姻观念，比如说彩礼、买房、买车和做家庭主妇这样的生活，她更向往自由自在，自己活的漂亮；而我更多的是会迁就她的性格，尊重她的选择，我也向往不受束缚的婚姻；而她觉得我越是迁就她，她的心理负担越重，会觉得我们思想不再一个层次，觉得三观不合；她说不希望我在她身上再继续浪费时间，希望就这样结束我们的关系；可我并不想这样，我觉得我还可以继续努力，我可以接受她的所有思想和缺点，我希望她能再多给我一些时间和机会，即使是以朋友的方式继续相处下去。 结合上述背景资料，替我给花花我写一段话，字数要求3000字左右，语言要有中国式通俗，可以适当穿插一些风雅之词，但不能影响内容的严谨和逻辑性，内容分段不要太短，以挽回她对我的好感，让我有机会和花花继续相处下去。","output":"花花： 漫长岁月里，我们生命中的每一个时刻，不离不弃。如朝露般短暂，如星河般永恒，将岁月刻画成一幅无尽的长卷，我怀揣着一颗感恩的心，走过时光的河畔，感慨生命中的美好瞬间。 在这两个多月里，我们携手欢愉，似雪中梅花，傲雪凌霜。从未来到现在，我为结识您这般知心，成为我生命中一道无法抹去的美好风景。但我们的感情似乎恍若天际，越见中洲渐行渐远，我甚至无法触摸浪漫曾经盛开的凄美。 相知相知彼此间的误解如潮般涌来，让数字和节拍在这初心场景中成为催眠般的魔咒。华宇之中，我们谈论着金钗破镜重圆的传统婚姻观。您渴望的是自由的生活，彷徨漫漫长空，身边无拘无束；而我则愿为您遮风挡雨，守住繁华；您在追求梦想的路上，我默默地支持结果；您青衷依依，我负担沉重。岁月的长河留下了我们彼此间的阴影，像是洒满泪光的晨曲，泣诉着昔日辉煌的巅峰。 真诚之心，付出总需回报，我对您的迁就并非屈从，而是对您理想的尊重。我们的感情中，有时也需要对彼此加以理解。灯前夜雨见清晰何时，灯下尘埃理智相识之间。相信两颗心，依然可以共同成长，犹如同根生的三生石。岁月在纸扇上留下回忆，诗篇翻过黄金堆积。只要我们肯倾听对方的声音，哪怕只有微弱的余音，我们都有机会再度找寻曾失去的珍宝。 我想说，我并非无法接受您的思考和决定。爱情的轨迹千变万化，白头"},{"instruction":"50 YouTube channel names that provide content about cars","output":"1.

I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.) Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.” (My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl. Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.) Sayori: “I can’t believe this! MC has been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too! How could he do this to me?” Monika: “Sayori, calm down. We don’t know for sure that he’s cheating. Maybe they’re just friends.” Yuri: “But the picture seems to suggest otherwise. And that girl’s belly…she’s definitely pregnant.” Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?” (Just then, MC enters the room.) MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?” (Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.) Sayori: “How could you, MC?” MC: “What do you mean?” (Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.) Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!” MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.” (Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.) Sayori: “Your cousin?” MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.” (Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.) Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions. I just saw the picture and…” MC: “It’s alright, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.” (Yuri and Monika both look relieved, and the tension in the room eases.) Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?” (Everyone nods, and we all move on from the misunderstanding. A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.) Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.” MC: “No problem, Emily. We just wanted to see how you and the baby are doing.” Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily. And congratulations on becoming a mother.” Emily: “Thank you, Yuri. It’s been quite the journey.” Sayori: “I’m sorry again for jumping to the wrong conclusion about you, Emily. I didn’t mean to make things awkward.” Emily: “Don’t worry about it, Sayori. I understand why you were upset. But I promise you, MC has been nothing but a supportive cousin to me throughout this whole pregnancy.” Monika: “Well, now that everything’s cleared up, let’s celebrate the new addition to the family!” (We all cheer and bring out a cake to celebrate Emily’s soon-to-be-born baby. It was a warm and joyous occasion, and we all felt grateful to have each other in our lives. But just moments before we were supposed to leave, Emily and I started to feel pain in our bellies - labor pains at that.) Emily: “Oh no, it looks like it’s time. I’m about to give birth.” Natsuki: “And me too, I think. I wasn’t supposed to give birth for another week.” (MC rushes to help Emily, while Yuri and Monika help me.) MC: “Don’t worry, Emily. We’ll get you to the hospital.” Yuri: “And we’ll do the same for Natsuki.” Monika: “Let’s hurry, we don’t want to waste any time.” (Without another word, both me and Emily were rushed into the car. Emily was in the back seat, while I was in the trunk. But just before we could reach the hospital in time, my labor pains were getting stronger by the minute - and my body started to push the baby out on its own, and extremely quickly.

Emily: \\"Who would have thought that a misunderstanding would lead to this many happy moments?\\" MC: \\"It just goes to show that even in the darkest of times, there’s always a light at the end of the tunnel.\\" (We all hugged and exchanged happy tears.

The season started with a lot of promise for the Bobcats as they had a new coach, Paul Silas, who was brought in to help turn things around. The team also had several new additions including veteran point guard Kemba Walker and rookie Kawhi Leonard. Leonard quickly proved to be a valuable asset to the team as he showed his defensive prowess and ability to score from outside the paint. He averaged 12.5 points and 6.7 rebounds per game, earning himself a spot on the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Despite Leonard's strong performance, the Bobcats struggled to find their footing and ended the season with a disappointing 7-59 record. However, Leonard's potential was still recognized and he was a major reason why the team was able to build towards a better future. Overall, the 2011 NBA season was a turning point for the Charlotte Bobcats as they brought in promising young talent in Kawhi Leonard and looked to build towards a brighter future. While the season itself may not have been a success, Leonard's addition to the team proved to be a wise decision that paid off in the years to come."},{"instruction":"write a 2012 nba season with bobcats best record and championship","output":"The 2012 NBA season was one of the most exciting in the history of the Charlotte Bobcats. After drafting Kawhi Leonard in the previous season, the team made a number of key moves to improve its roster and make a run at the championship. Under the guidance of head coach Mike Dunlap, the Bobcats put together an impressive regular season, finishing with a franchise-best record of 56-26. The team's success was due in large part to the emergence of Leonard as a dominant force on both ends of the court. He averaged 19.6 points and 9.3 rebounds per game and was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year. In the playoffs, the Bobcats continued to dominate, sweeping their way through the first two rounds before defeating the Miami Heat in a thrilling seven-game series to reach the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder, who were led by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. The Finals proved to be another hard-fought battle, with the Bobcats and Thunder trading blows throughout the series. But in the end, it was Leonard who proved to be the difference maker. He delivered a stellar performance in the decisive Game 7, scoring 34 points and grabbing 12 rebounds to lead the Bobcats to an 88-83 victory and the franchise's first-ever NBA championship. Leonard was named the Finals MVP, capping off a remarkable season in which he established himself as one of the league's premier talents. The Bobcats' championship run was hailed as one of the greatest in NBA history, and the team's success was a testament to the hard work and determination of everyone involved. For fans in Charlotte, the 2012 season would be remembered as a time when anything was possible, and the Bobcats were on top of the world."},{"instruction":"帮我一篇关于前开口20寸登机行李箱女铝框拉杆箱男多功能旅行密码箱静音万向轮的网购好评","output":"我最近在网上购买了一款前开口20寸登机行李箱，这是我第一次购买这样的箱子，我非常满意。这款箱子有许多出色的特点，包括女铝框拉杆箱、男多功能旅行密码箱、静音万向轮和前开口设计。 首先，这款箱子可用于男女旅客，因为它是一款多功能旅行箱。箱子的设计有多层结构，可以方便地存储所有物品。此外，箱子还有一个可调节的拉杆，可以根据身高来调节拉杆的高度，从而轻松地拉动箱子。 其次，箱子还有一个很不错的密码锁，这是一项很好的安全措施。我不用再担心我的箱子会被盗或者被非法进入，这个密码锁很可靠。 这个箱子的静音万向轮也非常不错，这是因为它可以让箱子在地面上平稳地移动，而且不会发出任何噪音。箱子的轮子还可以360度旋转，这意味着我可以很容易地将箱子推到任何一个方向。 最后，箱子的前开口设计让我很惊喜。我发现它可以让我更加方便地取出箱子中的物品，而不必把整个箱子倾斜。这项设计让我感觉到很舒适和方便。 总的来说，这是一款非常好的箱子，我强烈推荐给有旅游需要的人。它结构合理、安全可靠、方便实用，值得一试。"},{"instruction":"reformule le mail suivant :\\"Comme convenu, je te laisse ce message pour confirmer la fin de chantier de l’entreprise GAMON.

Ταυτόχρονα, σε επίπεδο κοινωνίας, είναι ιδιαίτερα σημαντικό να διαμορφωθεί μία γενική κατανόηση της τεχνολογίας, των επερχόμενων αλλαγών, των ευκαιριών αλλά και των σχετικών κινδύνων. Σε επίπεδο πολιτείας, απαιτείται μία νέα στρατηγική με έμφαση στο εκπαιδευτικό σύστημα αλλά και ένα νέο πλαίσιο λειτουργίας της αγοράς, των επιχειρήσεων και των κρατικών μηχανισμών. Απαιτείται επίσης ένα ισχυρό πλαίσιο για την αποφυγή της δυσανάλογης συγκέντρωσης τεχνολογικής δύναμης και ελέγχου” Write a text (about 60 words) in English with this theme: Ποιους κινδυνους εντοπιζει ο συντακτης του κειμενου απο την προσβαση στα δεδομένα, στην γνωση και στην τεχνολογια που δινει η τεχνητη νοημοσύνη;","output":"The author of the text identifies serious risks related to the access to data, knowledge, and technology provided by artificial intelligence.
