This maxim has proven to be an incredibly effective strategy, not only in winning games but also in building strong team dynamics. The underlying principle of \\"look for the pass first\\" is that the individual player should not be the focus of the game. Instead, the emphasis is on team play, where each participant plays a critical role in achieving a common goal. By looking for the pass first, players develop the habit of scanning the field or court for opportunities to pass the ball to a teammate in a better position. This strategic approach helps prevent the game from becoming too individualistic and fosters cooperation, communication, and trust among team members. It creates a selfless environment, where each player holds themselves accountable to the team's success, rather than personal accolades. Moreover, \\"look for the pass first\\" can improve team performance. By involving every player in the game, a team can draw out different players' strengths and blend them together to form a more efficient unit. An effective pass can bypass an opponent's defense and set up a scoring opportunity. Thus, successful passing increases the chances of scoring and helps the team win the game. The \\"look for the pass first\\" philosophy also teaches valuable life lessons. It promotes the values of teamwork, collaboration, and collective responsibility towards a common goal. These values help in developing relationships that extend beyond the field or court and into daily life. In conclusion, \\"look for the pass first\\" is a basic principle that has tremendous implications in team sports. It fosters good team dynamics, improves individual and team performance, and teaches valuable life lessons. So, if you are interested in improving your team's performance, developing better relationships with your teammates, and having a successful season, always remember to look for the pass first."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Aaron Boogaard, draftTeam, Minnesota Wild","output":"Aaron Boogaard was drafted by the Minnesota Wild."},{"instruction":"The 26 letters directly shown by bopomofo are transcribed in the following table .

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of a country's economic performance and productivity. It represents the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period, usually a year. By looking up the GDP of your country, you can get an idea about its economic strength and growth. The higher the GDP, the better the economy. Once you have found your country's GDP, you can calculate your own GDP by dividing the total GDP by the population. This calculation will give you an estimation of your country's economic output per person. By checking your country's GDP per capita, you can determine its economic status and its ability to provide for its citizens. In addition to GDP, the Human Development Index (HDI) is another measure that can help you understand the social and economic status of your country. HDI takes into account factors such as education, health, and standard of living to determine a country's level of development. A higher HDI score indicates that the country is more developed, while a lower score indicates a less developed country. You can also find out where your city ranks on the Mercer Quality of Living Survey, which measures the quality of living in cities around the world. This survey ranks cities based on factors such as safety, healthcare, education, public transportation, and recreational activities.

However, it's important to remind yourself that there's a difference between being by yourself and feeling isolated. To combat these feelings, take a step back and look at your life from a distance. Ask yourself if there are any areas where you could benefit from more connection or interaction. One of the best ways to get out of your own head is by practicing mindfulness. This involves becoming more aware of your thoughts and emotions in the present moment, without judging or reacting to them. You can start by simply taking a few minutes each day to close your eyes, focus on your breath, and notice any sensations or thoughts that arise. Another important step is to follow through on your plans and pledges. When you make commitments to yourself or others, it's important to stick to them. If you find that you're frequently canceling plans or backing out of commitments, it can start to erode your self-confidence and make it harder to form meaningful relationships.

Unfortunately, the transfer hit a stumbling block after a lack of guarantees from then-England coach Stuart Lancaster. The flanker's potential move to Bath ultimately collapsed due to this issue. Following these developments, it appears that Saracens flanker Will Fraser may be stepping up to fill the void left by Armitage. Fraser has been playing solidly for his team, and experts believe that he's likely to receive a call-up to the England squad soon. We'll have to wait and see whether he'll be able to make the kind of impact that Armitage would have had, but Fraser certainly has a lot of potential. One person who's likely to be disappointed by the news of Fraser's potential call-up is Danny Cipriani. The talented fly-half has had a mixed career, but many believed that he would make it into the Elite Player Squad this year. Unfortunately, it seems that this will not be the case. Cipriani will have to continue working hard if he wants to make it back onto the national team at some point in the future. Overall, these developments show that rugby is a constantly evolving sport. Teams and players must adapt to changes in the game, be they due to injury, transfers, or changing coaching staff. While Armitage's move to Bath fell through, it seems that English rugby may have some new stars on the rise in the form of Fraser and other players who are waiting for their chance to shine.

As a result, people are left lining up for clean water donated by FEMA and other agencies. The situation has been compounded by nearly 700 people claiming to have symptoms of exposure to tainted water, with four individuals being hospitalized. The company responsible for the spill has apologized, acknowledging the severe impact that the incident has had on the state. One official even compared the ban to a prison from which they would like to be released. Unfortunately, the water company said there is currently no timetable for when the water can be used again, leaving many residents stranded and unsure of what to do next. Fortunately, President Obama has ordered federal aid for the state, and the National Guard has been mobilized to assist. The guard is currently stationed at an air base at Charleston's Yeager Airport, helping to distribute clean water and other resources to residents in need. Overall, this incident serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible corporate practices and the need for emergency preparedness. It is crucial for companies to take proactive steps to avoid potentially hazardous situations and to have contingency plans in place in the event of an emergency. It is also important for individuals and communities to have access to timely and accurate information to ensure their safety during such incidents."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Taste of Cambridge eatType restaurant; Taste of Cambridge priceRange high; Taste of Cambridge customer rating 1 out of 5","output":"\\"Taste of Cambridge is a high-priced restaurant in Cambridge with a low customer rating of one out of five.\\""},{"instruction":"w would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @tcolkett thats great to hear!

You can open the IDE by double-clicking the arduino.exe file in the IDE folder. Once the IDE is open, you can begin coding your robot's movements.

To build and upload the program, simply click on the \\"upload\\" button in the IDE. It is important to note that while building and testing your robot, you should always have a kill switch to shut off power in case of emergencies or malfunction. To add this functionality to your program, you can use a simple push button or switch to break the circuit when pressed. Here is an example of how to add a kill switch to your program: \`\`\` // initialize kill switch pin const int killSwitchPin = 4; void setup() { // initialize motor pins pinMode(2, OUTPUT); pinMode(3, OUTPUT); // initialize kill switch pin pinMode(killSwitchPin, INPUT_PULLUP); } void loop() { // check if kill switch is pressed if (digitalRead(killSwitchPin) == LOW) { // stop the motors digitalWrite(2, LOW); digitalWrite(3, LOW); } else { // make the robot move forward digitalWrite(2, HIGH); digitalWrite(3, LOW); } } \`\`\` In this example, we have added a kill switch pin to the setup function and initialized it as an input with a pull-up resistor. In the loop function, we check if the kill switch pin is pressed. If it is, the motors are stopped. If not, the robot will move forward as before.

He is known for his military campaigns and conquests, which helped him become one of the most successful rulers in Burmese history. His second invasion was towards the Shan states. After consolidating his power in Burma, Bayinnaung turned his attention to the neighboring Shan states, which were located to the east of the Burmese kingdom. The Shan states were a collection of small kingdoms and principalities, each with its own ruler and army. They were mostly independent, but sometimes formed alliances with each other to resist outside threats. Bayinnaung saw the Shan states as a potential threat to his kingdom and decided to invade in 1557. He led a large army of about 80,000 men and attacked the Shan states from multiple directions. It was a challenging campaign, as the Shan warriors were known for their fierce resistance and guerilla tactics. However, Bayinnaung was a skilled commander and was able to outmaneuver and defeat the Shan forces. He captured several cities and towns, including Mong Yang, Keng Tung, and Chiang Tung. He also imposed his authority over the Shan rulers and forced them to pledge loyalty to him. This effectively brought the Shan states under his control and expanded his kingdom's territories. The second invasion of Bayinnaung was a significant event in Burmese history, as it marked the beginning of the Burmese empire's expansion in Southeast Asia. It also demonstrated Bayinnaung's military prowess and strategic skills, which were essential to his success as a king. The conquest of the Shan states laid the foundation for Bayinnaung's future campaigns and conquests, which continued until his death in 1581."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about LaserDisc.","output":"What is LaserDisc and how does it differ from other video formats?"},{"instruction":"w would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? aaw the @jonasbrothers suspend they account on youtube why guys?@jonasbrothers OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"negative"},{"instruction":"Logan: what are u wearing?

The study states that 70 percent of the link between height and genetics is due to genetic factors, while environmental factors make up the remaining 30 percent. The findings of this study could explain why millions of Britons fall under the average height of 5'3\\" for women and 5'9\\" for men. The study utilized a sample of 450,000 men and women, measuring their height and analyzing their DNA. By examining the genetic markers associated with height, the researchers were able to confirm a genetic basis for height. Furthermore, the study revealed that height is influenced by numerous genetic variants, each having a small effect on final height. This means that even though genetics plays a dominant role in determining height, environmental factors, such as diet and physical activity, can also play a significant part in reaching one's full height potential. Despite the 70-30 split between genetics and environmental factors, the study's lead researcher, Professor Tim Frayling, emphasized that environmental factors should not be overlooked. He stated that, \\"Although genetics explains the majority of variation between individuals, environmental factors such as nutrition also play a role in achieving one's full height potential.\\" The study's findings have important implications for understanding human growth and development, but also for understanding the genetic basis of other human traits. By uncovering the genetic basis of height, researchers can now apply similar techniques to study other complex traits such as intelligence and personality. Overall, the Edinburgh University study reveals that there is a significant genetic basis for height, but that environmental factors also play a role.

One interesting tidbit was that Lionel Messi, the star forward for Argentina, would be sharing a room with fellow countryman Sergio Aguero. This news came as a surprise to many, as Messi is often seen as a solitary figure on the football field. However, the two players have been close friends since childhood, and it seems fitting that they would share a room during such an important tournament. Another interesting pairing was that of Angel di Maria and Ezequiel Lavezzi. The two midfielders, who both play for PSG, would be sharing a room during the tournament. This move was likely designed to foster team chemistry, as the players already had a strong understanding of each other's playing styles. Meanwhile, Fernando Gago, another midfielder for the Argentine national team, would be enjoying a room to himself.

Chief executive has hinted at future plans in recent weeks. If a deal is struck it could still take months before it is available. Netflix shares closed up nearly 8 per cent during trading yesterday.","output":"Possible article: Internet Service in Talks with Cable Companies, Future Plans Hinted by CEO Sources close to the negotiations have confirmed that an internet service provider (ISP) is in talks with several cable companies about a potential partnership that could expand the ISP's reach and customer base. While details of the talks are still confidential, some industry analysts believe that the ISP could leverage the cable companies' infrastructure and technology to offer faster and more reliable internet service, particularly in areas where the ISP has limited or no coverage. According to these sources, the talks have been ongoing for several weeks, and involve top executives from both sides. However, no official announcement has been made yet, and the outcome of the talks remains uncertain. One potential obstacle could be the regulatory approval required for such a partnership, given the complex and evolving nature of the telecommunications industry. Another potential challenge could be the financial terms and incentives involved, as well as the role and ownership of the joint venture. Nonetheless, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the ISP has hinted at the company's future plans in recent interviews and earnings calls. While not confirming the talks directly, the CEO has emphasized the importance of strategic partnerships and alliances in the ISP's growth and innovation strategies. The CEO has also mentioned the need to invest in infrastructure and technology, particularly in the area of fiber optic networks and wireless connectivity. If a deal is struck between the ISP and the cable companies, it could still take months before it is available to customers. This is because of the complexity and scale of the integration process, which involves not only the technical and operational aspects, but also the marketing, sales, and customer service components. Moreover, the ISP would need to ensure that the new services are compatible with its existing offerings and pricing plans, and that they meet the expectations and demands of its target market. In related news, Netflix shares closed up nearly 8 per cent during trading yesterday, fueled by speculation that the streaming giant may benefit from the potential partnership between the ISP and the cable companies. Netflix has long been a thorn in the side of traditional cable providers, as it offers a wide range of original and licensed content at a lower price and without the need for long-term contracts or expensive equipment. However, if the partnership results in faster and more reliable internet service, it could enhance the overall streaming experience for Netflix users, and attract more subscribers who value quality and convenience."},{"instruction":"The Second Silesian War was a theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession.

Through the lens of aimless birdwatching adventures, the author captures the rhythm and idiosyncrasies of rural existence, as well as the heartbreaking realization that the land and culture that define a community are disappearing forever. Kimberling's voice is a delightful blend of natural history enthusiast John Audubon and the angsty, disillusioned teenager Holden Caulfield. His protagonist, Nathan Lochmueller, is a wayward young man who finds solace and purpose in birdwatching. Together with his best friend, an aspiring writer, and a cast of colorful characters, Nathan wanders the back roads and woods of his hometown, observing the beauty of the natural world and reflecting on his place in it. But beneath the whimsy and wonder of Nathan's adventures lies a sense of unease and melancholy. The small town he loves is changing rapidly, as farms give way to subdivisions and traditional ways of life are lost to modernization. Nathan struggles to come to terms with this reality even as he continues to seek refuge in the familiar rhythms of birdwatching. Through Kimberling's vivid descriptions and pitch-perfect dialogue, \\"Snapper\\" immerses readers in a world that is both idyllic and haunting. The author's writing is a masterful concoction of nostalgia, humor, and pathos that will resonate with anyone who has ever felt a deep connection to a place or a way of life that is slipping away.

Brendan Ross, a 21-year-old brother of the Yale Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, was driving a U-Haul truck to a tailgating event when he struck and killed Nancy Barry. He also injured two other women in the accident.

Scottish professor Thomas Munck argues that although the Masons did promote international and crosssocial contacts which were essentially nonreligious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right. Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers. Diderot discusses the link between Freemason ideals and the enlightenment in D'Alembert's Dream, exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs. Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought. On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism. He argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds. The presence of noble women in the French lodges of adoption that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society.

This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the socalled verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning.

Add a snap closure to a wrap dress for multiple options.

One simple hack to make your dress more versatile is to sew extra fabric into it. This technique is especially helpful if the dress is body-hugging, as it allows you to maintain the fit while adding coverage where you need it. You can use a matching or contrasting fabric to create a visual interest and make the dress more unique. Another way to make your dress more adaptable is to add a snap closure to a wrap dress. This small addition can lead to multiple styling options, as you can wear the dress cinched in at the waist or have a looser fit. Snap closures also add a more refined touch to your dress and enhance its functionality. You can place the snaps at different locations to create various lengths for the skirt or adjust how much chest coverage you want. If you have a dress with a plunging neckline, but you prefer a higher neckline, shortening the straps can solve this issue. By pulling the straps up and attaching them higher up the dress, the neckline pulls up as well. This trick is straightforward to do and can work with most dress styles. However, keep in mind that this adjustment will change the way the dress fits, so you might need to make further alterations to ensure it is comfortable and not too tight or loose. Overall, dress modifications are a simple yet effective way of refreshing your wardrobe and getting creative with your style. With some basic sewing skills and these hacks, you can transform your dress into a versatile piece that you will wear for many occasions."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: After the assassination of Uthman in 656, Ali, a member of the Quraysh tribe and the cousin and soninlaw of Muhammad, was elected as the caliph.

In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954.

He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent.

This step ensures that the task can be completed without any interruptions caused by lack of resources or the need to pause in the middle of the process to go look for additional materials. Therefore, before initiating any project, it is essential to list all the required resources, including equipment, raw materials, and tools. Once the list is complete, the next step is to cross-check any existing supplies to determine what is available and what needs to be obtained. In cases where all materials are not readily available, it is essential to identify the best sources to obtain them. This could involve researching retail stores or consulting with industry professionals for recommendations. Furthermore, when purchasing materials, it is essential to consider the quality and quantity needed to complete the project successfully. Opting for cheaper materials with lower quality may seem economically sound, but they might create additional obstacles during the project due to damage or errors caused by weak materials.

Both kickers have played for multiple teams and have made countless field goals throughout their careers. But just how many yards have they combined for? When looking at Hanson's career statistics, he made a total of 495 field goals and 739 extra points during his 21-year career. This adds up to a total of 2,150 points scored. It is important to note that not all field goals are the same distance, as the location of the kick on the field can vary. However, on average, Hanson made field goals that were around 38 yards each. So, if we were to estimate conservatively, we could say that Hanson's 495 field goals added up to around 18,810 yards. Now, let's take a look at Gould's career statistics. In his 16-year career, Gould has made 372 field goals and 523 extra points, adding up to a total of 1,639 points scored. On average, Gould's field goals are 36 yards each. Therefore, we can estimate that his 372 field goals add up to around 13,392 yards. Adding the yardage of Hanson and Gould together, we get a grand total of approximately 32,202 yards.
