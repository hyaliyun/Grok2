Schools should be a place of safety, learning, and engagement, but when cell phones are allowed in the classroom, it becomes a source of distraction, particularly for students. Cell phones can easily take away the attention of students and encourage cheating. Furthermore, it’s possible for students to access inappropriate websites or applications while using cell phones, potentially resulting in further issues in the educational environment. nnThe most important and integral part of learning is focusing on the subject matter, without which students cannot absorb the material. Cell phones can easily become a major distraction in the classroom, taking away the attention of students away not only from the teacher but also from their peers and other classroom materials. Cell phones also provide students with opportunities to cheat. In the current climate of high-stakes testing, having access to information on the internet can be a temptation that some students may not be able to resist. nnAdditionally, the access to inappropriate websites or applications can lead to further issues in the school environment. Students may use cell phones to access websites such as social media, which can detract from the educational setting. Cell phones can also become a safety issue in the classroom, as students may use their phones to take pictures or videos of other students, which can undermine a student’s privacy. nnOverall, the use of cell phones in the classroom should not be allowed. It is a major source of distraction and can cause students to miss key information in the lecture. Additionally, cell phones may be used to cheat and access inappropriate websites, undermining the educational experience. For these reasons, cell phones should not be allowed in school."},{"instruction":"Analyze the economic implications of a national minimum wage.?","output":"The implementation of a national minimum wage has both positive and negative economic implications. nnOn the positive side, a national minimum wage increases the wages of lower-wage workers and reduces poverty by ensuring that workers are paid an adequate living wage. It also increases worker motivation, encourages recruitment, and reduces workplace stress. Additionally, a higher minimum wage can stimulate economic growth due to increased consumer spending. nnOn the negative side, the imposition of a minimum wage reduces the number of available job opportunities due to the resulting increase in labor costs. This can result in fewer people being employed and an increase in underemployment. A higher minimum wage can also be cost prohibitive for small businesses, as they may not be able to afford to hire low-skilled workers. Additionally, a minimum wage increase might lead to price increases for consumers, due to increased production costs for businesses. nnIn conclusion, a national minimum wage can help bolster the economy by increasing the wages of workers and encouraging economic growth. There are also potential negative economic implications, however, such as reducing job availability and increasing prices for consumers. Each country should carefully consider the implications and impacts of a national minimum wage before implementing it."},{"instruction":"Compare and contrast two methods of teaching using technology.?","output":"Traditional face-to-face teaching and teaching using technology are two different ways of delivering instruction. nnThe most obvious difference between the two methods is the use of technology. Traditional face-to-face instruction requires the physical presence of the teacher and students in the same room, while teaching using technology relies on the use of digital mediums. This can include online platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet, but can also include virtual classrooms, videos, or audio recordings. nnAnother difference between the two methods is how the class is structured. Traditional face-to-face teaching is structured around lectures and class discussions, while teaching using technology is often more self-directed and can be structured around online activities such as online quizzes or research projects. nnLastly, the interaction between the teacher and the students is different for the two methods. Traditional face-to-face teaching relies heavily on the facilitation skills of the teacher, with the teacher being able to physically observe the students to ensure understanding. Teaching using technology has less physical interaction, so the teacher must rely on different methods to ensure understanding such as using polls or questions in a chatbox. nnIn conclusion, while traditional face-to-face teaching and teaching using technology have some similarities, such as the need for instruction to be clear and organized, they differ in terms of their approach, structure, and interaction."},{"instruction":"Generate a title for an essay on immigration reform.?","output":"The Benefits of Comprehensive Immigration Reform: A Case for Change."},{"instruction":"Explain why fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources.?","output":"Fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas are non-renewable resources due to the fact that they are finite and cannot be replaced once they are used.

Rising sea levels, melting polar ice caps, and increases in global temperatures are all contributing to the destruction of fragile ecosystems and the displacement of millions of people across the world. nnOne of the most significant consequences of climate change is its detrimental effect on the global economy. As temperatures increase and weather events become more abrupt and severe, industries reliant on natural resources are likely to be hit hard. Farmers and fishermen whose livelihoods depend on varying climates already beginning to feel the effects of climate change, and the economic damage caused by their losses can be devastating to entire communities. nnClimate change is also likely to contribute to amplified political and social tensions as more people are displaced by the effects of higher temperatures and unpredictable weather. The conflict and resource scarcity that results is unlikely to be good for any economy and could have serious implications for many nations. nnIn addition, the consequences of climate change are not confined to just one area. Global warming will have a lasting effect on the environment, and can have far-reaching effects that extend far beyond the boundaries of one country. For example, ocean temperatures are rising on a global level, leading to rising levels of ocean acidity, which affects the species that live in and depend upon marine ecosystems. nnThe economic impacts of climate change are complex and will be felt in many different sectors. Businesses and industries will have to adjust their practices to reflect the changes in climate and natural resources, while individuals and communities will have to adapt to new and changing conditions in order to remain economically viable. nnClimate change is an issue that affects us all and if we do not act now the economic effects could be devastating.

Glaciers in the Arctic are melting at an accelerated rate as a result of rising atmospheric temperatures, and this, in turn, is leading to a range of environmental and socio-economic consequences. This report will provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of global warming on the Arctic, based on data from recent studies. nnOne of the most visible effects of global warming on the Arctic is the rapid melting of its glaciers. Models based on observed trends and data from the past few decades have indicated that glaciers in the Arctic Ocean could disappear by the end of this century. This would result in a drastic impact on the local environment, including a reduction of sea ice cover and a corresponding rise in sea levels.nnThe melting glaciers are also causing changes in the Arctics climate, as heavier rains and longer summers lead to extended snowmelt and seasonal changes. As a result, local wildlife is facing significant changes in their natural habitats, while native communities are seeing a decline in their hunting grounds. This has serious consequences on the traditional worldview, with some communities now struggling with both social and economic pressures, leading to a surge in migration.nnGlacier melting is not the only impact of global warming on the Arctic. The environment of the Arctic is also facing a range of other consequences due to rising temperatures. These include a decrease in permafrost, an increase in the intensity and frequency of wildfires, and a corresponding loss of biodiversity.nnIn conclusion, the Arctic is facing a range of consequences as a result of global warming, with the most visible of these being the rapid melting of its glaciers, along with a shift in climate, impacting the environment and native communities. In order to reduce the impact of global warming on the Arctic, it is essential that global governments take urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and implement policies to mitigate the effects of climate change.\\""},{"instruction":"Determine the optimal time for a company to launch a product to maximize sales?","output":"The optimal time to launch a product to maximize sales depends on multiple factors, such as the market that the product is targeting and the seasonality of demand.

But what exactly is organic food, and is it worth the hype? This article discusses the pros and cons of eating organic food. nnOne of the biggest advantages of eating organic food is that it is free of potentially harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These substances can contaminate soil and water sources and can have a detrimental effect on human health. Organic food is grown without the use of these chemicals and can therefore reduce the risk of exposure to contaminants. nnAnother benefit of organic food is that it often contains higher levels of certain vital nutrients, such as vitamins and antioxidants. Studies have also suggested that organic produce is higher in certain phytochemicals and fatty acids, which may have health benefits. There is also some evidence that organic meat and dairy products may be higher in certain beneficial fatty acids and may contain fewer antibiotic residues. nnHowever, there are some potential downsides to eating organic food. The most significant of these is the fact that organic food is often more expensive. This can put organic food out of reach for people on a tight budget. Additionally, organic food may have a shorter shelf life than non-organic food. nnIn conclusion, there are both pros and cons to eating organic food. Organic food can offer a number of health benefits, such as higher nutrient content and fewer chemical contaminants. But it is often more expensive than non-organic food, and it may have a shorter shelf life. Ultimately, the decision to buy organic or not will depend on individual preference and budget.\\""},{"instruction":"Make a list of 10 ways to make a difference in the world.?","output":"1.

Inequality is widespread, with the top 1% of earners taking home nearly a quarter of the nations income and the bottom 50% of earners only earning 15% of the national income. The disparity is staggering, and the effects of this inequality are devastating for those on the lower half of the ladder. It is time to address this growing inequality and the vast economic disparity that comes with it; the redistribution of wealth is an important step towards a fairer and more equal society.nnThe primary benefit of redistributing wealth is that it helps to reduce economic inequality. This is particularly beneficial for lower-income groups, who have little economic access and stability, but would gain more of a say in the economic landscape if income was more evenly distributed. With more equal access to resources, people can invest in their health, education, and development. This can lead to improved productivity in the workforce and a stronger economy. Additionally, the funds from tax revenues that would fund this redistribution of wealth could be used to invest in important social programs and initiatives that can help improve the quality of life for disadvantaged populations.nnSimilarly, wealth redistribution can also help to reduce poverty and increase mobility for those in low-income households. This can be done through policies that target the gender income gap, pay inequalities, and support for education and employment opportunities for those in need. In addition, sufficient funds should be given to infrastructure projects and welfare initiatives to reduce the burden on families in low-income households. This can help to create much-needed jobs, as well as provide needed services in communities that would otherwise lack access to financial resources.nnWealth redistribution can also bring about a more democratic society. When wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, there is a risk of economic and political power becoming consolidated, resulting in the government and businesses becoming distant, more disconnected from the people. Redistribution can work to counteract this concentration of power by bringing economic power closer to the people and allowing them more control over their lives.nnIn conclusion, the redistribution of wealth is necessary to create a more just, equitable, and democratic society. It is beneficial to those in low-income households by providing opportunities for economic access and financial stability, as well as helping to reduce poverty and increase mobility. This redistribution can also lead to better public services, increased investment in social programs, and empowered communities.\\""},{"instruction":"Choose the most accurate statement about creativity.?","output":"Creativity is the ability to think outside of the box, generate new ideas, and solve problems in innovative ways."},{"instruction":"Create a thesis statement for a research paper about the benefits of reading books.?","output":"Reading books can provide a person with a wealth of knowledge and insight, as well as physical and mental health benefits, making it a fundamental part of self-improvement."},{"instruction":"Write a brief comparison of two different types of cheese.?","output":"Cheddar and Gouda are two very popular types of cheese.

It is meant to be funny but also be written in the authoritative style of a news report, kind of like The Onion.","output":"Today marks a new day in not only American history but world history. We are no longer alone in the universe. Life outside our planet exists and aliens have landed in Nevada. NASA scientists had been tracking a strange non-terrestrial object for days leading up to today's big event. The object appeared from behind the dark side of the moon and was originally believed to be an untracked asteroid or comet. However, the object's path and speed started changing until today it entered Earth's atmosphere. Instead of burning up like a hunk of space rock, it was able to penetrate the atmosphere and survive. The military scrambled jets and the first sighting described the flying object as being triangular with a matte black exterior and no visible ports of entry or egress. It was a tense few moments as first contact was made but the craft was allowed to continue unhindered as it showed no hostile intent. Passing over Washington, D.C., Chicago, and other major metropolitan areas the craft finally touched down in Nevada. Many top officials believed they were heading to the notorious Area 51. But that proved not to be the case as the UFO instead landed directly on the Vegas strip. Roughly the size of a 747 jet, all traffic stopped immediately. Two figures exited the craft distinctly humanoid in shape. The taller of the two raised its right hand and made a gesture splitting their fingers into a V-shape and spoke in perfect English, \\"Live long and prosper.\\" It was at this point that the shorter alien slapped the taller alien on the shoulder and let out an audible sigh. They were Trekkies. The aliens were Star Trek fans. As people approached the aliens they noticed they were clad in the uniforms of the original Star Trek officers, one in yellow for command and one in blue for science specialty. This was no alien invasion, this was a vacation. The aliens were allowed to proceed as journalists and military personnel alike shadowed them. They went directly to the casino already possessing American dollars and proceeded to lose it all at the dice table in less than an hour. Following this display, they went to the buffet and ate three plates of crab legs. These visitors to Vegas were not too different from us. We are not alone."},{"instruction":"Write a funny, short story about someone who will stop at nothing to go green and reduce their carbon footprint.","output":"Garry has a real green thumb, and taking care of the environment is extremely important to him. He takes every possible step to cut his carbon footprint, and it inspires and mystifies everyone around him in equal measure. Each night before he goes to bed, he cuts off the power to his house so that his electronic devices don’t draw idle power. Almost all of his appliances are quite old, as Garry wants to get as much use as possible out of them before contributing to new pollution-generating production. The only exceptions are his new, water-efficient dishwasher and his solar-powered hot water tank. The Homeowner’s Association hates Garry because he grows corn on his front lawn. All of his food is locally sourced as much as possible, and he commutes to work on a bike that doesn’t look like it should work.

Thank the editor for highlighting this important topic. Rewrite all the main facts in the article. A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs. This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was \\"still acting weird\\" the next day. After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter. In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: \\"[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog. \\"I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.\\" Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they \\"weren't out of the woods yet\\", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. The experts explained: \\"Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them. \\"Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting.\\"","output":"Dear Editor, Many thanks for raising this important issue in your paper.

It is great that Marrianne Whyte shared her warning on Facebook because it raises awareness of this issue. In fact, her post has been shared 1.5 million times. When she tried to wake her dog up, she thought the dog had been having a dream, or been experiencing night terrors. However, she found that he was \\"still acting weird\\" the next day. The following day Marrianne set off for another shift but had to return home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter because the dog wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very out of character because he was a happy dog. After returning early from work Marrianne Whyte found the dog in a confused state, so she took him to the emergency vet. It was then she discovered that the tea tree oil in her diffuser is toxic for dogs. There is a happy ending to the story, because fortunately, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage. However, the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Cat lovers should also be aware, as Vet Clinic Pets on Parker, so rightly points out. Cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils. Cats don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. Cats' livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. Dogs, like me, do not lack this enzyme, but we are still sensitive to essential oils and we are liable to become very sick if exposed to them. Owners can look out for common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation from an oil diffuser, by watching for laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors and vomiting. Therefore, you see the terrible effects that these diffusers can have on animals like me. I thank you for highlighting and raising awareness of this problem. I hope that no other dog will have to suffer as a result of tea tree oil diffusers.

I want you to craft a scene that sets up the female lead, who is 17 and was picked up by a detective who wants to take her to the station so they can help her.

Her hair looked like it was probably silky, but at that moment, it was a bit of a frazzled mess. She wore a tight-fitting purple dress that accentuated her slim figure and slight bust. She wasn't wearing shoes or socks, and when she stepped, one could see the black caked on the soles of her feet. Surprisingly, she didn't wear heavy makeup. It was light and natural, with mascara, a light blush around her cheeks, and subtle lip stain being the only adornments. These, of course, were not her most notable features. When she walked into the dinner, her eyes were hollow. They held no shine--no recognition of life, even. If there was someone behind that dull glare, she was certainly preoccupied with other things. No amount of beauty or makeup would have hidden away the hideous truths that were buried beneath her. However, that didn't seem to be the purpose of her attire or makeup. To Rustage, it didn't seem that she had any purpose at all, but he couldn't simply leave her alone. Something told him there was a story there that needed to be uncovered. It wouldn't be his job. He only handled the strangest, most obscure cases that weren't for the light of heart or sane. It wasn't right of him to pass a child who was clearly in need. He would take her back to the station and let them take care of her. That was his plan, at least.

Warning: second terms are terrible. Now, the bad news for Democrats. Beginning with George Washington, second terms are a litany of troubles. No modern president has had a good time of it. Work backwards: George Bush’s second term started with Katrina and ended in financial disaster; Clinton met Monica and was impeached; Reagan ran into Iran Contra, saw his approval plummet, lost the Senate, had a bout with cancer, and grew deeply despondent. Richard Nixon resigned. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack, a stroke, and became enmeshed in civil rights. FDR lost his coalition in Congress, saw the economy falter, and was humiliated when he tried to intervene in the midterm elections. Of course, history is not destiny. But it offers second-termers a gloomy warning. It gets only harder and the burdens of office take a personal toll.","output":"In short, second terms have been historically tough for a lot of past presidents.

Writing down your thoughts helps commit them to memory. 3. Take a rest. Put your book away for a couple of weeks after completion and let your mind mull over the content. 4. Consider how you're paying attention. When you read, focus only on reading. Don't let distractions get in the way. Put your phone in another room and sit somewhere comfortable and quiet so you can pay better attention to the page in front of you. 5. Schedule around your reading time. Instead of fitting in time for reading in your already busy schedule, do it the other way around.

Guinea pigs are animals that are best in bonded pairs or groups. You should never adopt only one guinea pig as they are social creatures. Guinea pigs need to eat hay (timothy, oat, or wheatgrass) every day as their teeth are constantly growing and need to be ground down as they chew. They should also have nutritional pellets daily and a mixture of vegetables. Never feed your guinea pig iceberg lettuce, though, as it's too watery! When your guinea pig learns its feeding pattern, you'll notice a high-pitched 'wheek!' sound coming from their cage as soon as the fridge opens or they hear the rustle of a plastic bag! Supplement your feedings with occasional Vitamin C drops, also. Take your guinea pigs out once a day for free roam or floor time so that they can stretch their legs and play. Cages should be at minimum 2 feet by 3 feet for a single guinea pig - but more is always better if you've got the space. Boars need to have boar cleanings once a month where you'll clean out their inside sac of all the hay, food, and bedding particles that accumulate in there. Speaking of bedding - many owners recommend using fabric cage liners for guinea pigs as it's soft on their feet, easy to clean, and good for the environment. These include a top and bottom layer of fleece with an absorbing pad in the middle. You'll just wipe up quick messes of pee or poop on top, then throw the liners in the washing machine once a week. If you can't do liners, soft untreated paper bedding is best."},{"instruction":"I’m looking to visit Berlin but have no clue what neighborhoods to stay in.

He tried again. Nothing. Jeff exited the vehicle and walked back to his dad. \\"What do you think it is?\\" he asked. Jeff's father began touching things on the engine, seemingly actively investigating the source of the vehicle's problems.

I had no idea where I was and I knew no one and nothing, except for the fact that I was surrounded by enormous, strange beasts with ghastly features. The place I had woken in was dark and gloomy, and I soon came to learn that there was never any sunshine at all. There was nothing but dark clouds above, and the only source of light was the brief flickering of the lightning from the thunderstorms. I didn't know what was more frightening to me - the sound of the raging thunder, the growling of the beasts, or the fact that I was entirely alone. As I walked through the desolate forests of these lands, seeking food and shelter, I wondered how I had arrived at this place. Had I been cursed by a witch or wizard? Was I in a deep sleep or trance?

The storm last night had been pretty frightful, and the pasture was beset with rain and thunder the entire night. As Dotty went around her pen, she noticed something that caused her to stop dead in her tracks. The fence was down, likely due to the storm last night. Dotty was terrified; the fence wasn't supposed to be down. Now, all manner of scary creatures could get inside and eat it. It was this thought that triggered a radically opposite one: she could explore outside the pen. Finally, get to see what was in those woods on the other side of the street. Now that she thought about it, she was convinced to try it. She took the brave first step over the broken plank and made her way toward the road. It was still early morning. The farmer wouldn't even notice she'd gone for the morning, and besides, she would be back within a few hours. She took her first step onto the road, noting just how much firmer it was than the soft grass of the pasture.

What is hi-fi audio? Hi-fi audio, also known as high fidelity audio, is simply audio that is very high quality. The factors that play into this level of quality are a high accuracy at reproducing the audible frequencies in audio, and extremely little distortion in the original audio signal. This in general is what “high fidelity” means. Let’s break this down in another way. You’ve likely heard of lo-fi music before; if not, it’s a genre that is often mixed with elements of jazz or hip-hop. The instrumentation is not relevant for this example, however; let’s focus on the general sound. Lo-fi music is characterized as having a low quality, almost underwater type sound, usually with crackling and warping sounds from a vinyl record, to add to the ambience. Instruments are usually “broken” sounding or boxy. With hi-fi, it’s simply the opposite of lo-fi. If lo-fi audio is described as being old, broken, and fuzzy sounding, hi-fi is accurately described as sounding clear, clean, crisp, and free from distortion and other unwanted sonic artifacts. A more technical answer would be this: Music files that have a higher sample rate and/or bit depth than CDs are what high fidelity audio is considered to be. CDs have a sample rate of 44.1 KHz and a 16-bit bit depth, so as long as at least one of these numbers is higher than those of a CD, audio is considered to be hi-fi.","output":"Hi-fi audio—as opposed to lo-fi, which a defining characteristic of is its low-quality sound—is high-quality audio with exceptional frequency response and little if any distortion. More technically, it refers to audio with a sample rate higher than 44.1 kHz and 16-bit bit depth."},{"instruction":"Reframe this tutorial as someone describing their starting experiences with music production. Expand on some of the experiences like mixing and mastering music. Starting music production from fresh is an overwhelming experience for most people. It certainly was for us! But don't worry, it's really easy to get involved in the world of production. If you want to get into the audio engineer route, go volunteer at studios. Try to get a job as a runner, or a tea/coffee boy. If you stay there long enough eventually you'll be taught things and climb the ranks. If you just want to make beats in your bedroom, then the first thing you should do is download a free DAW, or pay for one. Next, learn the basics of your DAW, and start to try and make a song. It doesn't matter how bad the song is, or how far away it sounds from what's in your head. Just start doing it. When you run into something that you don't know how to do, or understand, head to YouTube and watch some tutorials on it. Once you've finished a song, attempt to mix it down, and attempt to master it after that. First start off by just using volume levelling to mix your songs, and get a feel for what level each instrument should be at. Then start learning what compression is, what EQ is etc. Make sure to watch tutorials on how to mix certain instruments, like vocals, or how to use certain tools you don't understand. But, don't get stuck in a rut of watching tutorials and not doing anything. The best way you will learn is by doing. After making your first couple songs, start to learn about sound design. Choose a synth, and learn it inside and out. We recommend Serum for learning, as it's beginner friendly and a powerhouse of a synth. Keep making new songs, and trying out the new things you have learned from tutorials. You will improve rapidly by doing this. A good thing to do is try to separate sessions and spend different days of the week doing different things to improve your learning.","output":"I had no experience when I started trying to make music, so I was super overwhelmed by all of my options. I had a lot of possible avenues to take, so it was a bit hard to come to a decision. I wanted to start small, so I just downloaded a DAW and started going at it, watching tutorials online to help me find my way. It was rough: I couldn't make anything I liked the sound of, I couldn't really capture the rhythms or melodies in my head, or they'd leave me before I had the opportunity to get them down. Not only did I have to worry about all of those things, but there were also all the complicated things like EQ, mixing, mastering, and a bunch of other stuff I didn't really understand. It was hard to find a balance, both literally (getting the levels of instruments and vocals to sound right), and figuratively (finding out what to do and putting that into practice). It was a struggle pushing through all of that, but it kind of got easier as time went on. I started trying to learn a bit more about sound design with Serum, a synthesizer that's both easy to understand and really good at what it's meant for. I kept at it, trying to make more songs and improve, and it's steadily worked. Something that helped me out was trying different techniques or practices on a given day, which helped me focus on various skills I needed to learn."},{"instruction":"I have 2 lists below.

As of recently, I feel the UFC is throwing together the crappy cards and there is nothing to look forward to until UFC 290. Look at last weekend's card and headliner which was Dern Vs Hill SMFH... then the upcoming piss-poor UFC fight night cards and I wonder what the hell is going on. Up until UFC 290 in July, there are like 1 to 2 fights max per fight night cards that I care for and I'm a diehard fan of the sport. The next PPV (UFC 289) card is just an abomination on so many levels with the only saving grace being Olivera vs Dariush. I would even go as far as to say the last Canadian card UFC fight night 158 Vancouver (2019) is better than the embarrassment that is UFC 289. I feel that the roster is just oversaturated to hell with so many middle/low tier fighters who need to be cut as harsh as that might be and because of that the UFC are increasingly pushing quantity over quality to meet quotas, as they have to offer their fighters x number of fights a year. Speaking of UFC 290 which is in international fight week compare that card with UFC 239 card which was in 2019 (pre-covid) and it's just so, so much more stacked on every level, including the prelims, much more fitting for international fight week. Even UFC 276 international fight week last year compared to UFC 290 was just better in my view on paper (more compelling fights overall). Also before everyone jumps on me, UFC 290 is not a bad card (although why the f is Jack Della Madellena on the prelims) but each year I just feel the state of matchmaking declining further and further down with these shitty filler fight nights like last weekend. A lack of big-name stars committing to fights stuck in limbo (Conor, Khamzat, Jones etc etc etc), bigger-name fighters getting injured on PPV and the UFC moving them entirely instead of booking replacements (Thompson Vs Perriera as an example), no more triple champion cards (UFC 217 being my all-time favorite), ever-increasing PPV prices for less quality is just making the product dull. Instead of these BS fight nights cards I wish they would cut 1/3 of the roster and do every month one solid PPV stacked from top to bottom like how it was trending towards before 2020 hit. Sorry for the long rant but surely I'm not the only one feeling this way, maybe you guys have different views but I think it's becoming frustrating as shit being a fan of the UFC and my interest is just slowly being chipped away.","output":"Okay, I’ll try to explain it simply.

One consideration in support of this theory is the observation made by Hubble's Space Telescope that confirmed recently that the expansion of the universe - caused by the Big Bang - is neither slowing nor remaining constant, but is instead accelerating. Current hypotheses about the cause for this acceleration include the presence of an exotic form of energy, called dark energy, which is causing the speeding up of the expansion of the universe. However, scientists have yet to find any evidence that such dark energy exists. In the black hole theory of the universe, it could be argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe is leading all matter in the universe toward a black hole singularity since any object that falls into a black hole experiences increasing acceleration when falling toward a black hole's singularity - its center. Another observation in support of the universal black hole theory is the fact that a large portion of the universe's mass seems to be missing and unaccounted for. While dark matter has been posited as the missing piece of the puzzle, it is also plausible that the unaccounted-for matter that is missing could be in the form of a black hole singularity that exists somewhere in the universe but which we cannot readily see yet due to large distances between it and the instruments we use to observe the universe. Since the bulk of a black hole's mass exists as a single point within the black hole when gravity compresses a great amount of mass into it, it could be argued that the majority of the mass of the universe exists as a singularity within the black hole universe in which we reside. Overall, we may not be able to find the answers we seek even with extensive study into the observations we make of our universe. With current technology and the limitations imposed on us by the sheer size of the universe, we can only rely on indirect observations of phenomena to infer what is really happening in our universe."},{"instruction":"Write a 3-paragraph blurb about why labradors make good pets.

These colors can be used anywhere in your home, but focus on the entrance area and the places your guest will see most. Put a lovely Spring wreath on your door or lay out a pretty pastel doormat to set the tone. Ensure the rooms where guests will spend the most time mingling and eating also receive this color treatment. This can include decorative throw blankets and pillows, table settings, plates, napkins, and tablecloths. Beyond color themes, colorful Easter eggs are at the top of the list, followed by bunnies and chicks. You can use these elements to make fun and colorful decorations such as a basket of colored eggs, a wreath made of eggs, or a centerpiece made in the shape of a bunny. Finally, Easter is associated with sweet treats, specifically candy. A lovely Easter idea would be to have a sweet and dessert table. Include pastel-colored candies prominently.

They will be replaced by a crew of equally well-trained kangaroos. As a breed, kangaroos are known for their strength, having been trained to box for many years in Australia. This aptitude adapts well to the hand-to-hand combat training cadets receive in the police academy. Their speed is comparable to that of our canine officers, thanks to their ability to leap great distances. Kangaroos have to wear a minimum of gear, using the storage naturally available within their pouches. And many kangaroos have an imposing size, with some breeds exceeding 7 feet in height. The inaugural unit of kangaroos, the KangaRegiment, has been trained to the same high standards of performance as the department's retiring K-9 officers. Each Rooficer (as these kangaroo officers are nicknamed) was individually selected from hundreds of applications from well-qualified Rooficer candidates. To be offered the position, the candidate had to measure between 7 and 8.5 feet in stature to present an intimidating physical presence. They had to outperform other candidates in distance leaping. And they had to show prowess inside the boxing ring. We request that citizens respect these new police officers in the same way you did our K-9s: do not approach them or their human partner officer in a menacing way, and do not try to pet them without asking their human partner officer first. Remember, these are service kangaroos, and when you see them with their partner out in the field, they are on the job, protecting the citizens of Macadamia County. Please join me in congratulating our new Rooficers and wishing our retiring Canines a well-deserved, restful retirement!"},{"instruction":"What team won the premier league in 2006?","output":"Manchester United won the Premier League in 2006, they hadn't won since 2002."},{"instruction":"Who was the top goal scorer for Everton in 2012?","output":"Marouane Fellaini was the top goalscorer for Everton FC in 2012 with 11 goals in the Premier League."},{"instruction":"Which 4 teams qualified for the champions league in the 2018/2019 season?","output":"The four qualifying teams for the Champions League in the 2018/2019 Premier League season were: Manchester City, Liverpool FC, Chelsea FC, and Tottenham Hotspur."},{"instruction":"Write a limerick with a light tone about a man falling in love with his own reflection","output":"There was a dashing young farmer Who was quite an incorrigible charmer He met the new queen Who thought him a dream But he fell for the mirror of her armor"},{"instruction":"Please write a sad story about a kid named Kevin losing their dog.

Step 4 Using a 1/4-cup (60-milliliter) measure, divide the batter among the muffin tin cups; each should be filled about three-quarters of the way. Step 5 Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Step 6 Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then run a small offset spatula or butter knife around the perimeter of each muffin before removing them from the tin. Serve warm.","output":"This is a fresh take on muffins with some unexpected savory ingredients - goat cheese and chives. For this recipe, you will need to set your oven to 375 degrees and position the rack in the middle. A nonstick muffin tin is recommended, but brush the tin with mild-tasting olive oil just to be safe. The first step is to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl. Start with one-and-a-half cups of whole-wheat pastry flour, one-half cups, at pastry flour. If you don't have it in your pantry, you can use white whole-wheat flour or three-quarter cups (100 grams) of all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour. Two teaspoons of baking powder provide the leavening in this recipe. Follow this with one-half teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and one-quarter teaspoon of fine salt. Briefly whisk the ingredients together to combine them. In a larger bowl, whisk the wet ingredients: two-thirds cup (180 milliliters of whole or reduced-fat milk or plant-based milk; one half-up (113 grams) of plain Greek yogurt, one large egg, and one teaspoon of honey. Once these ingredients are well combined, add the flour mixture. Stir the wet and dry ingredients together, but only until just combined. For the primary flavoring, gently stir in four ounces (115 grams) of fresh crumbled goat cheese, also sold as chevre and one half-cup of finely chopped fresh chives. After the batter is done, divide it equally between the muffin tin cups. Each cup should be about three-quarters full. Using a one-quarter measuring cup as a scoop is a good guide. From here, the muffins go into the preheated oven. We are looking for golden-brown muffin tops, which should take about 18 to 20 minutes. You will know the muffins are done when an inserted toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. Transfer the tin to a wire rack to add in cooling. After five to ten minutes use a butter knife or offset spatula to remove the muffins. These tasty muffins are best served warm.

Keep in mind that if your song doesn’t contain much similar sonic information as your reference tracks, a mix cannot sufficiently create these sounds or frequencies as they simply do not exist in your production. After you’ve exported a rough mix:","output":"Define your vision: You have been writing your song and refining it for weeks. You know exactly how it should sound and where you want it to go. Take note of this information. This is all information for the engineer and will provide them with a good place to start when getting your music ready for the radio. If you have already completed a rough mix of your song, you’ll want to include this along with your files and tell your engineer what works and doesn't work. If your song is similar to a song by a different artist, be sure to tell your mixing engineer. They can use this as direction when mixing your song. Explain to them what you like about that artist's music that they can bring out in your music. Keep in mind that if your music is not already similar to the other artist's music then it will be impossible for the mix engineer to effectively use it as a reference."},{"instruction":"Please write me a short story about a serial killer.

Nothing exciting, just some Cheerios with skim milk. The coffee black with a pinch of sugar and just a dash of Jack Daniels. It was a bad habit of mine, but everyone has their vices. On the TV, a breaking news alert flashed across the bottom of the screen as they cut to a field reporter standing near a local park. I reached for the remote and turned up the volume a few notches. \\"... are reporting they've found yet another body. Again a young female with brown hair. The victim, Amanda Raser, was a middle school teacher. She leaves behind a loving family, a husband, and a number of students. A truly devastating tragedy as this spree of murders continues to ravage the community. Signs are beginning to indicate that this may be the work of a serial killer although the police urge the public not to panic. At this time the police report they have no leads or current suspects for the string of murders, but they assure you they are working tirelessly and feel a breakthrough is imminent.\\" The rest of the report faded into background noise as I leaned back in my seat. I grabbed my coffee by the handle and took a long sip. I set the mug down again on the coaster and a smile crept across my lips. They still had no suspects or leads, which meant I was in the clear. It may be harder now that everyone is on high alert, but I relished in the thrill of the fear I was causing."},{"instruction":"Create a short blog post about the Spice Girls with an intro, 2 H2 subheadings and 3 H3 subheadings.

When Scary, Sporty, Baby, Posh, and Ginger entered the girl band scene with their teen pop, I hopped on the bandwagon. I haven't looked back since! There are a lot of cool facts that people don't know about the Spice Girls, which is why I'm writing this post today. Follow along with me as I take you through the history of these girl power icons. The Early Days [H2] The Spice Girls first got their start in 1994. It's wild to think that nearly 30 years have passed since then! The girls had to audition for the group, which led to the five members - Mel B, Melanie C, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria Beckham. First Steps [H3] When the Spice Girls started, they wanted to pave their own path. They signed with Virgin Records and soon put out my favorite Spice Girls track called \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996. Did you know that the Spice Girls' first album sold over 20 million copies globally? They were truly a record-breaking girl group. Spiceworld Tour [H3] By 1998, these girls were on a roll and ready to tour the world. Millions of people showed up to their shows, and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on tickets. But sadly, Ginger Spice was ready to leave the band at this point. Later Career [H3] Despite the changes in the lineup, the Spice Girls continued to release some amazing songs, like the ever-famous \\"Goodbye\\". By the time the new millennium arrived, the Spice Girls were fizzling out, much to my chagrin. Looking Back at the Spice Girls Today [H2] In the nearly three decades that the Spice Girls have existed, they've broken a lot of female pop star boundaries! The group has sold 100 million records globally, become one of the most successful British pop groups since the Beatles, and won numerous industry awards. These girls will forever inspire me!"},{"instruction":"Write the first 5 steps on how to ride a bike for beginners.","output":"1) Adjust the bike - Make sure the bike is the right size for you and that the seat is at the right height. 2) Find a flat, open space - Look for a flat, open area like a parking lot where you can practice riding your bike safely. 3) Put on a helmet. 4) Sit on the bike with both feet on the ground. 5) Push off with one foot while keeping the other foot on the ground."},{"instruction":"When did Michael Jackson pass away?","output":"Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, after a long career as a singer, dancer, and songwriter.

To do your base, it's important to use a natural-looking cream or liquid foundation for the skin. Keep it light and delicate, erring on the paler side. Top with a peachy or flesh-colored powder to keep the face matte. For your brows, a fuller, more arched look was popular at the time. Use natural tones for your eyeshadow, or omit it altogether- shadows were quite minimal for the period. Instead, opt for a soft liner on the upper lash line that blurs out into a slight wing. Finish the eyes with mascara. Blush should be placed high on the cheeks, and should never be placed lower than the tip of the nose. Go for a rose or pinky color. Finally, line your lips with a lip pencil and fill them in with a corresponding lipstick. Though reds shone in the '40s, this decade was all about pinks and purples and orange-toned reds."},{"instruction":"Please rewrite this text so that a middle schooler could understand the story. Segregation was written into law; the front of a Montgomery bus was reserved for white citizens and the seats behind them for Black citizens. However, it was only by custom that bus drivers had the authority to ask a Black person to give up a seat for a white rider. There were contradictory Montgomery laws on the books: One said segregation must be enforced, but another, largely ignored, said no person (white or Black) could be asked to give up a seat even if there were no other seats on the bus available. Nonetheless, at one point on the route, a white man had no seat because all the seats in the designated “white” section were taken. So the driver told the riders in the four seats of the first row of the “colored” section to stand, in effect adding another row to the “white” section. The three others obeyed. Parks did not.","output":"In Montgomery, there were laws about what we now call segregation. The law said black people had to sit on the back of the bus in the \\"colored\\" section, while white people could sit up at the front of the bus in the \\"white\\" section. Now, if a white rider got on the bus and it was full, the bus driver could ask a black person to give up their seat. This wasn't always true for all buses because the rules could be confusing. But on this day, when Rosa Parks rode the bus, that's what happened. The bus driver asked her and three others to get up from their seats for white riders who did not have a seat. The other three got out of their seats, but Rosa Parks did not."},{"instruction":"Write the beginning of a drama about somebody being fired using corporate jargon.

I have continued to put forth the type of effort they expected of me even though I no longer play basketball.

Yes, it will probably be difficult at first, either because you've lost your way or you've forgotten where you wanted to go in the first place. There's nothing wrong with that. It is a chance to reevaluate what you want to do with your life.

He recently totaled my car and is working extra hours after school at WalMart to pay for it. - Tina, she is my middle child and she is playing a minor role in the school’s version of Our Town. She spends a lot of time on social media and locks herself in her room much of the time. She loves fashion and makeup and changing her hair color. It’s pink right now. - Bella, my youngest is getting her wisdom teeth out in January and she has been busy babysitting and dog walking for extra cash. I think she might be saving all her cash for something big. - David, my husband, his bowling team came in 6th out of 7th in the league so he didn’t have to drink beer out of a bowling shoe. - Me, Tanya, pick up people’s messes, take our 3 dogs for walk in blizzards at 4am and turn microwavable meals into delicious edible dinners.","output":"Merry Christmas to all of our family and friends! We have had quite a busy year here in the Fahrer household. Even though we haven’t been in touch often enough, we wish you the very best this holiday season and hope all of you are doing well. We wanted to share some Fahrer highlights with you all to keep you up-to-date and connected with our family. We encourage you to do the same! Our oldest boy, Mark, is excited to play center on the school’s basketball team. However, not quite as excited as he is to be working extra hours at WalMart to pay for my car after he crashed it. Don’t worry, though! Keep your cards and letters home, he and Ashley (his new girlfriend) are doing just fine. As a matter of fact, I think she got a job there, too, so they can spend even more waking moments together. We also couldn’t be prouder of our little fashionista, pink-haired Tina. She has landed a role in the current school play, Our Town. This is an amazement to all of us because previously, her favorite hobby was to scroll through social media while locked away in her room. Our Town, or even our house, was surely a mystery to her before the stage called. Our youngest, Bella, is our little entrepreneur. We are convinced she’s stashing her babysitting and dog-walking money away for something big. Will she buy us a new house? A new car? New siblings? Meanwhile, David and I have been busy leading our normal lives with kids who, clearly, have minds and dreams of their own. David’s bowling team squeaked out a near-loss and escaped a disastrous sip of beer out of a smelly bowling shoe by landing 6th out of 7th place. And, while he throws a shiny black ball down an alley, I’m taking our dogs for walks in the blinding snow and getting creative with home cooking. Despite all of this, or maybe because of it, we are never far from cracking a smile and spreading holiday cheer! Want more updates? Can’t get enough Fahrer news?

Make small talk - Strike up a conversation with someone (or a group of people) at the party, or join a conversation already in progress. Start with simple interactions, such as \\"Hi, I'm (your name), nice to meet you\\" or \\"How do you know the host (of the party)?\\" 2. Tell an anecdote - Once you have someone's attention, tell a funny or amusing story. It doesn't necessarily have to be true, but consider telling a true story that is charming and showcases your actions and behavior in a situation. This will let people know what kind of person you are and whether or not they want to continue getting to know you better. 3. Do a magic trick - Sometimes people just need a little magic in their lives. Doing a little bit of close-up magic, simple tricks that are easy to learn but have a great effect, can amaze people. Learn some tricks that use ordinary objects that you might have on your person (coins, paper money, a piece of thread) or something that would be available at a party (playing cards, drinking cups). 4. Play a game - Always sure to get a party started and encourage mixing and mingling among partygoers, playing a game can be entertaining and will give you a chance to get to know others in a fun setting. Play a physical game like Twister or Charades, card games like Poker or Hearts, or board games like Monopoly. 5. Show off some interesting pictures - People love looking at photos and getting to know what others look like in candid situations. If you have photos of yourself on vacation to an exotic location or simply having fun during a recent trip, consider showing them around at the party. They will give insight into who you are as a person, and it may also allow others to show you what pictures they have of themselves."},{"instruction":"Can you write an email draft for me to my sister, Pam, who is coming to my daughter's dance recital next month?

During consecutive quarters this year, the longtime leading streaming site saw year-to-year declines in subscribers, marking the first time that had happened in 10 years. By the time the streamer reported third-quarter results, its growth was back on track, but the damage was clearly done. NetflixNFLX +1% fast-tracked its new ad-supported tier and began testing a system for banning password sharing. Those moves will be closely scrutinized in 2023, with observers keen to see whether consumers will accept major changes to the very DNA of the popular streamer. Netflix’s subscriber loss was certainly one of the biggest surprise headlines of 2022. What will be this year’s? Here are five streaming trends to watch for in 2023. Both Disney+ and Netflix recently introduced ad-supported platforms, and AmazonAMZN -3.7% is accepting ads for Thursday Night Football. How consumers receive the lower-priced, ad-supported tiers may determine whether other platforms adopt similar approaches. While some initial reports suggested Netflix didn’t meet early advertising promises, this week, CFRA raised its stock price target for the streamer based on a strong outlook for the ad-supported platform. “We think it will be difficult for competitors to catch NFLX, one of the few profitable streaming providers with global scale,” wrote CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon. The specter of the disastrous CNN+ launch will loom large in 2023. Where it once seemed the market was saturated with 800-pound gorillas like Disney+ and HBO Max, the fast folding of CNN+ and the takeaways from that will serve to keep future niche launches more limited. With people reaching a saturation point with their new subscriptions, it’s a big risk to launch something with limited appeal. Disney+ has crowed about moving ahead of Netflix in subscribers—which, granted, includes Hulu and ESPN bundles as well. But Disney+ has seen outstanding growth, including adding 12.1 million subscribers in third quarter to boost the three-way total to more than 235 million, or 12 million more than Netflix. Analysts have said they anticipate the recent launch of Disney+’s ad-supported service will push Disney+ even farther ahead in the streaming wars. ** Based on the above text, what are some key trends in the streaming industry?","output":"Ad-supported tiers are growing in popularity among streaming providers as they leverage their global audience and scale. Furthermore, launches of niche products will slow down given the poor reception of CNN+ and as people reach a personal limit of streaming subscriptions. On the flip side, Disney+ is experiencing rampant growth and is expected to pull ahead of the competition in terms of subscriber numbers with the launch of its own ad-supported tier."},{"instruction":"I have some round steak in my freezer that needs to be cooked.

He got what he needed to take care of her through piracy – running a torrenting website that monetized illegal downloads of songs and movies. It wasn’t much, and he often thought about how lame he looked compared to the pirate crews of old. Back in the old days, pirates had their own republic and commanded massive vessels capable of going up against anyone, while he could only tackle defenseless ships and had to run before any assistance came. He didn’t have a crew to sing sea shanties with, a parrot to perch on his shoulder, and his tattered outfit certainly couldn’t compete with 17th-century fashion. As he was going to sleep one night, he thought to himself, “If I had to be a pirate, at least I could have been one of the cool ones.” The next morning, he woke up and quickly realized he was not in his home. It was dark and the world was rocking side to side around him. Was this an earthquake? No, the rocking was because he was at sea. As Amir got out of his bunk, he looked around and saw other sleeping men and women. These were his crewmates.

It shouldn’t exceed ten bullet points: Once upon a time, there lived a greedy tortoise named Snow. In those days, the tortoise could walk as fast as the other animals. Snow lived with the rest of the animals in the jungle. Every day, each animal went out to do his work, but Snow preferred to stay idle and watch the others work. At the end of each day, all the animals would be paid their daily allowance by the queen of the jungle. One day, a fairy came to visit the jungle to see the queen and got lost. All the other animals in the jungle were extremely busy and couldn’t help the fairy. But the Snow saw the fairy. After watching her for a while, he approached the fairy. “Can I help you in any way?” He asked the fairy. “Yes please, I’m a fairy.” The fairy answered. “I’ve come with gifts to see the queen and I don’t know the way to her palace. Everyone else seems too busy to direct me.” She added. Upon hearing that the fairy had gifts for the queen with her, the tortoise became greedy. He began to think of ways to get some of the gifts from the fairy. So he came up with a plan to direct the fairy to a lonely place where he could snatch the gifts away from her. Snow answered the fairy and said “Well I know the way to the queen’s palace. It’s straight down the lane.” The fairy was very glad to have received help and thanked Snow. Then, the fairy left in the direction Snow gave her. Snow secretly followed her till she arrived at the deserted place. When the fairy got to the lonely land, she immediately knew that the tortoise had tricked her and that the place wasn’t safe. The fairy turned back to flee, but Snow popped up before her. The fairy was frightened and began to run. But Snow chased the fairy and caught up with her because he could run very fast. He grabbed hold of the fairy’s bag from the fairy and began to run away. Immediately, the fairy chanted a spell and pronounced a curse. “I lay on you this curse and torment, “For you robbed me with your lies and speed, “On the animal that holds my purse this moment, “You and every animal of your type, “Shall be slower than anything that ever lived.” Immediately after the fairy was done speaking, her bag began to swell bigger and bigger till it burst upon the tortoise's shoulders. Snow tried to run, but he could no longer. He couldn’t even walk with ease, for the curse had been placed on him. From that day on, even till today, Snow and all other tortoises were always slow.","output":"• There was a greedy tortoise named Snow, who lived in a jungle with other animals. • The tortoise could walk and run as fast as the other animals. • Snow was idle and preferred to watch while other animals worked. • One day, a fairy came with gifts to visit the queen of the jungle and needed help in locating the palace. • Snow got to know that the fairy had gifts and became greedy for them. • He gave the fairy false directions and led her to a lonely land. • Snow snatched the fairy’s bag from her and began to run away. • The fairy pronounced a curse on Snow and animals of his type to be slow forever. • The curse took its effect and since that time till now, Snow and all the other tortoises have been slow."},{"instruction":"Extract the dates of the timeline.

Board of Education (1954), Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964), and Loving v. Virginia (1967) which banned segregation in public schools and public accommodations, and struck down all state laws banning interracial marriage.[7][8][9] The rulings played a crucial role in bringing an end to the segregationist Jim Crow laws prevalent in the Southern states.[10] In the 1960s, moderates in the movement worked with the United States Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation that authorized oversight and enforcement of civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964[11] explicitly banned all discrimination based on race, including racial segregation in schools, businesses, and in public accommodations.[12] The Voting Rights Act of 1965 restored and protected voting rights by authorizing federal oversight of registration and elections in areas with historic under-representation of minority voters.

What are some high-calorie foods that are cheap? I live in the USA, so I have access to most foods.","output":"Here are five cheap foods in the USA that are high in calories. It's important to note that costs will differ based on location! 1. Canola Oil You wouldn't eat canola oil alone, but that's why it's great for weight gain. You can easily add it to other meals and boost your calorie intake with little effort. With 240 calories in 2 tbsp of canola oil, it certainly packs a punch. Canola oil is comparatively really cheap, also. You can usually buy a gallon for around 10. Canola oil is pretty versatile as well in terms of how you can get it into your diet. You can drizzle it on salads, fry things, or baste your meat with it. There is no shortage of ways to easily add calories when you use canola oil. 2. Potatoes Potatoes are perfect for gaining weight. High in carbs, high in calories, found everywhere, and pretty cheap, too. There are many ways to cook potatoes and have them as the main ingredient or the side of a dish. In terms of calories per dollar, potatoes are very competitive, with a pound of potatoes costing around 1. Not as cheap as canola oil, but potatoes are also far easier to have a lot of, especially when butter is added. Potatoes can be added to so many dishes. Making up a bulk of mashed potatoes and eating them as a snack is pretty easy. They can be boiled, mashed, baked, stewed, or fried when cooking. 3. White Rice White rice has been a high-calorie food used worldwide for a long time. Rice can be found everywhere. It's extremely cheap, and best of all, it can be the base of so many great-tasting dishes or even just added as a side to many others. Rice has a staggering 2,860 calories per roughly 1 when you buy in bulk, which is a great price. Rice can be used as the base of curries, added to soups and stews, go in tacos, burritos, and so much more. Rice is easy to cook and can be stored in the fridge for leftovers. 4. Pancake Batter Why not start your day with a high-calorie-dense breakfast that leaves you wanting to eat more throughout the day? Pancake batter is delicious, cheap, and high in calories. A 2lb box of pancake mix will cost somewhere around 2 and give you over 2,000 calories on its own, but when you add butter, milk, and syrup, you'll get an even higher calorie content. You can also use pancake batter to make other things, such as muffins. 5. Whole Chicken Whole chickens are incredible for calories and are usually in every major grocery store for bargain prices. These usually come pre-cooked, too, meaning you won't have to worry. You can buy a whole chicken cooked for 4.99 at Costco. That chicken should provide you with over 3,250 calories. That equals 650 calories a dollar. Chicken isn't the best on the list for calories per dollar but it's probably the best for versatility and ease of cooking. Consider trying a rice meal with chicken to get an easy high, calorie meal."},{"instruction":"Which sport does this description go with - tennis, pickleball, or racquetball?

Hailstone decides to stay with the unicorns, where he feels accepted for who he is. He spends the rest of his life happily among them.","output":"Treebranch was a stallion of brilliant white, so he always hoped his peers would name him something like pearl, ivory, or moonstone. He would have settled for snow, snowstorm, or even blizzard! But the first thing the other horses ever saw witnessed was this sharp and long horn that protruded from his forehead. It was like the branch of a tree, and from then, on he was known as Treebranch. He couldn’t help but be jealous of the other horses, especially those gifted with beautiful names like Thunderclap, whose hooves beat on the ground like the drum of thunder when he dashed across the plains – or Nightfall, whose sable coat glistened like stars under the sunlight. How could Treebranch ever compare? Especially when his horn was all any other horse could see. One day while the herd was moving across the grassy plains, a terrible storm began, with clouds so dark that it hid the sun. Torrents of rain and deafening winds caused mayhem, and Treebranch found himself separated from the others. The storm had subsided. He tried to make his way back to them. However, he found himself lost in a forest instead. That’s when he stumbled upon another band of horses, and the first thing he noticed was the long horns that grew out from their forehead! “Oh, a fellow unicorn,” one of them said as means of greeting. “What is your name?” “The other horses call me Treebranch,” he replied. “That’s far too unfitting a name for such a beautiful unicorn.” “They call me so because they cannot see beyond my horn.” “Then you must live with those of us who do,” the unicorn said. “Live with us, and we shall know you as the white unicorn that came to us from the storm, and henceforth call you Hailstone.” Hailstone, what a dashing name!

I could chow down on these every day and still enjoy them more than the brand-name ones. Cheap, but they've got a very good value for the price."},{"instruction":"Why are plants green? Give me a simple answer most elementary school children would be able to comprehend. Incorporate a cooking analogy for photosynthesis.","output":"Most plants are green because they make their own food. When we make food we call it cooking or baking, but when plants make food it's called photosynthesis. They keep an important ingredient they need for photosynthesis inside them. This ingredient is called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll mixes with sunlight to make food for the plant. Sunlight looks white to us, but has all the colors of the rainbow in it. Plants don't use the color green from sunlight when they make food. Since the color green doesn't mix with the chlorophyll during photosynthesis, green is the color we can see."},{"instruction":"How do AI chatbots actually understand what people type?","output":"Indeed, what is understanding?

I could feel her fear and sorrow through our connection. I didn't know exactly where she was, but I knew how to find her. Now that my body had healed from fighting the thousand arms, I was ready. I grabbed the invitation card and looked at the address. It was a fancy hotel run by the Akatsuki Group. On the outside, they were a powerhouse with hotels, restaurants, and other businesses. They were big shots. However, their real identity was the thousand arms, a black market group that dealt in the occult. They sought the greatest powers out there. When evening came around, I dressed and went to the hotel. I slid the invitation to the woman at the front desk. \\"I'm here for this event,\\" I said, my voice level. The woman looked at me carefully, then smiled. \\"Certainly, sir. I'll guide you.\\" The woman used a key and entered the code for a basement floor. I was led to a lavish waiting room, but it wasn't for VIPs. It was for the fighters. I did stretches in the room while I waited, and I received a visitor. It was a person in a red cloak, one of the thousand arms directly under the boss, I figured. Beneath his robes, he had hundreds of black arm-like appendages. \\"Touji-sama, I'm glad you came.

Can you suggest some of the best mountains for first-time climbers to try?","output":"1. Helvellyn, England - this is a mountain peak that beginners can easily climb in one day. Helvellyn may be accessed from the Ullswater villages of Patterdale and Glenridding. It is the third-highest peak in England and offers a unique climbing experience where expert or novice climbers can proudly reach the summit and make it back to the pub in time for a pint to celebrate. The ideal trekking season for this mountain is from spring to autumn, and climbers should be aware of the changing weather conditions throughout the year. 2. Hochschwab, Austria - The mountains of Northern Styria are filled with alpine huts that facilitate multi-day hikes, giving you a welcoming overnight stay as you climb to the top. The lodge that stands near the cliff face of this mountain was originally constructed in 1884 and offers an impressive panoramic view from its outdoor decks. The ideal trekking season for this mountain is from spring to autumn, with ski touring in the winter. 3. Emel Shan, China - This mountain climbing experience is often described as a spiritual one. A pilgrimage to the summit of this mountain is said to forgive all sins. The Emel Shan is the highest of China's Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains, and there are roughly 300,000 transgressors who make the journey to the summit every year. Staying true to the Zen mindset helps climbers deal with the never-ending stone steps and the suffocating crowds. The ideal trekking season for this climb is all year, but it is recommended to avoid any public holidays if you want to avoid crowds. 4. Mount Temple, Canada - Be sure to pack a high-quality camera when you go on this climb because this trek up one of the Canadian Rockies will take you to one of the most photogenic peaks in the world. The staggering views from the top turn the spectacular glaciers, mountains, and rugged terrain below into an amazing view of raw geography. The ideal time to climb this mountain is between July and August after the snow has melted. Keep in mind the rockfall from above and consider taking a helmet with you. 5. Mount Anne, Australia - With wild rivers, beautiful terrain, and perhaps even a wild animal or two, Mount Anne, located in Tasmania's Southwest National Park, looms above as the area's most prominent peak. Brave beginners can often take on the entire climb in a day, while others may prefer to take their time and camp out overnight. The best time to climb Mount Anne is between November and May. This is when the area has the best weather for climbing. 6. Snowdon, Wales If you are looking for a mountain climbing experience that the entire family can enjoy, Snowdon Mountain in Wales is excellent for climbing with kids. The mountain is associated with the legends of King Arthur, the fabled king is said to have killed a fearsome giant who once lived on the mountain and is reputedly still buried at the summit. While it is possible to trek Snowden Mountain throughout the year, the railway closes down during the winter. 7. Alvand Kuh, Iran - Ideal for cultural exchange, the mountain of Alvand Kuh is a good choice for beginners. It is one of the most popular peaks in western Iran for climbing or hiking and for good reason. The trek to the top may be completed in one day, but it can be fun to stay overnight with the locals at one of the mountain shelters along the way. The best time to trek this mountain is between spring and fall. If you have concerns about losing your way, it is a good idea to climb during the weekend so that you will be around other local hikers who will help you find your way to the top."},{"instruction":"Where was Ozzie Smith, the baseball player, born?","output":"Ozzie Smith (Osborne Earl Smith) was born in Mobile, Alabama on December 26, 1954.

Relax the muscles from your biceps to your shoulders. Close your eyes. Try to take your mind off whatever came before this meditation, as well as anything that will be coming after.

Do it again, with a deep breath in and an equally deep breath out. Feel on your exhale that you are softening your shoulders. Relax all movements around your eyes. Scan through your body as you breathe and look for the possibility of release anywhere your body feels tight or tense. Take this time to briefly take stock. Ask yourself a simple question: \\"How are you?\\" Now ask again, and pause. Don't answer immediately, and rather let your instinct fill that void with an answer. Now consider what your reflex response is - physically emotionally or mentally. There is no need to fix or plan or explain or work around what you're feeling. What is important during this time is visualization and noticing what comes up when you pay attention. Now ask yourself \\"What do I need to do today? What do I want to do today?\\" Is there a true intention or anchor to the to-do list today? What needs to be achieved? Think about what your reflexive response is - what comes from your heart? Focus on that as you breathe. Try to remain focused on this visualization throughout the day. How can you be the version of yourself that you are thinking of right now?

Assume astronauts have email up there, because I'm not sure if they do. They have found ghosts on the moon. Tone should be concerned and mildly panicked.","output":"Dear NASA, Please read this message and treat it as urgent, as the situation demands immediate attention. During our routine lunar mission, we encountered a phenomenon beyond our wildest imaginations. Unbelievably, we have found evidence suggesting the presence of ghosts on the moon. Yes, you read that correctly—ghosts! While it might sound like a work of science fiction or like we're possibly imagining things and have gone delusional due to lack of gravity, I promise you lots of us have seen this firsthand up here and we are deeply concerned (and maybe just a little bit panicked). The situation started with unexplained noises echoing during our moonwalks. We thought they were technical glitches with our spacesuits, but we could never find a source. Then several of our crew members reported seeing ethereal figures drifting silently among the craters. They kind of appear and disappear without warning, which can be very startling when one materializes nearby. Despite the extensive training we've undergone, it most definitely did not cover this, and it's taking a huge mental toll on us. Many of us up here just want to go home now. So our question is: how do we proceed? We think more people need to come up here and investigate the matter as to be honest, it requires extensive research and specialty that, as I said, wasn't really covered in our training. More to the point, I don't think the astronauts currently up here are equipped to deal with ghosts. I'm also worried that if they're on the moon, they might be present on Earth too, but I guess that's something to think about for when I'm back home and not right now...

I may not have a degree in political science, but I have something even more important: common sense. And well, honestly, you’re all boring and I’m fun. Let's talk about the economy - As someone who never worked a day in her life, I know exactly what it takes to create jobs and stimulate growth. We need to cut taxes for the wealthy and give them more incentives to invest in this country. As President, I would focus on the things that really matter to Americans like making sure rich people have the best quality healthcare, creating more jobs by having more servants and boosting the economy by selling more vodka and shoes. Let's also talk about foreign policy. As someone who has traveled the world and rubbed elbows with the most powerful people on the planet, I know how to negotiate with foreign leaders. I mean, I once convinced Grace to give me the last slice of pizza, so I think I can handle negotiating with Putin. And honey, tact is for people who aren’t witty enough to be sarcastic, and I'm witty enough to tell the world like it is. Finally, let's talk about the most important issue facing our country - fashion. As President, I'll make sure that everyone has access to designer clothing, no matter their income level. If I have to look at you, you better look good. If you're caught wearing Crocs in public, you'll be fined. It's time to take our fashion seriously. Pradas are not just shoes, and vodka is not just a morning beverage. In conclusion, I would bring a bit of fun and glamour back to the White House.

Please only summarize the text under this line: Northern North America is occupied by Canada, the second-largest country in the world, the US state of Alaska, and the Danish self-governing territory of Greenland. Much of Greenland is covered by ice, and all these regions are sparsely populated, although there are several large cities in Canada. These are mainly in the south of the country and on the Pacific coast near the stunning Rocky Mountains. Huge oil and mineral reserves have brought wealth to both Canada and Alaska. Alaska was part of Russia until 1867, when it was sold to the US for 7.2 million. Most Americans thought this was a huge waste of money until gold was discovered there in 1896, attracting many people hoping to make their fortune. The discovery of oil in the Arctic Ocean in 1968 brought great wealth to the state, and tourism is also a major source of income. The First Nations and the Inuit peoples lived in Canada long before Europeans began settling there in the 17th century. They number about 900,000 people, or 4 percent of the population, and have kept many of their traditional customs and traditions. In 1999, the self-governing Inuit homeland of Nunavut was created in northern Canada. Greenland is the world’s largest island, but has a population of less than 60,000 because its climate is so harsh and cold. Most live in small settlements along the coast, making a living from catching fish, shrimp, and seals. There is a small network of roads, but dogsleds and planes are more reliable than cars for getting around.","output":"The region includes Canada, Alaska, and Greenland with a low population density. Canada has large cities in the south and on the Pacific coast close to the Rocky Mountains. First Nations and Inuit peoples reside in Canada and have preserved their customary practices. Alaska, which was formerly part of Russia, is a valuable source of oil and minerals. Greenland, the world's largest island, has fewer than 60,000 inhabitants who make a living by fishing and hunting along the coast."},{"instruction":"I want you to write your own version of the popular children’s story The Three Little Pigs.

They each decided that they would take a different tactic and see which one would work. The first alcoholic, Joe, chose to remove all alcohol from his life. He took everything out of the house, refused to go to bars, and avoided liquor stores at all costs. For the first few days, it worked. He didn’t drink anything because nothing was available. But then, just one Saturday later, he was at a work event where there was an open bar, and he caved and had a drink. And then several more. The second alcoholic, Sue, tried a different path. She decided that she would read a book about quitting addictions. The book came highly recommended, and apparently, after reading the book, she wouldn’t even want to pick up a drink. Unfortunately, the book didn’t work at all. She drank the whole time she was reading it. The third alcoholic, Luis, chose to join a local Alcoholics Anonymous chapter. He started going to meetings several times a week and even got a sponsor who he could call night and day when he was tempted to drink. To Luis’s surprise, it was actually working. Although he still wanted a drink, he didn’t do it because of his incredible support system. When the three met up again, Luis told them what he had found at AA after they reported their failed tactics. And Luis, Sue, and Joe all headed to a meeting together."},{"instruction":"Write a graduation speech to be given by the guest speaker, Pluto the disgruntled former planet.","output":"Good afternoon, graduates, faculty, and distinguished guests. I am Pluto, the dwarf planet formerly known as the 9th planet. I am honored to be here today as your guest speaker and to share with you a lesson that I have learned over my long and eventful life. I want to congratulate every one of you for accomplishing this life-changing milestone. Graduating from college is an undertaking that requires years of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. You should all be proud of and celebrate all you have achieved. As you may know, in 2006, the IAU decided to reclassify me as a dwarf planet. Honestly, this decision was an affront to my ego and attacked the core of my sense of identity. I always considered myself a full planet and was a proud member of the planetary community. Being the 9th planet of the solar system was important to my identity. To be kicked out of that community was a devastating blow that has taken years to recover from. I share this because this struggle has taught me a lesson that I would like to focus on today. As a planet, I have seen many changes in the universe over the years. I have watched the birth and death of stars, and galaxies collide. The one thing that has remained constant is change. At times it seems as though we cannot survive all of the chaos and it rocks us to our core. But here is where I urge you to remember this lesson. Sometimes, even oftentimes, the world will not see you as you see yourself. You may face hurdles that challenge your very sense of self-worth and identity. But it is not up to the universe, or scientists, to define who you are. It is up to you to define who you are and what you stand for. Just because someone tells you that you are not a full planet does not mean that you are any less important or valuable. You have the power to define your own identity, and to make a difference in the world. In closing, I want to congratulate you on your graduation and wish you all the best as you embark on the next phase of your journey. And remember, even if the world does not always see us as we see ourselves, we are still important and valuable. Thank you."},{"instruction":"I want to change my life.

She looked at the screen on the headrest in front of her and saw the flight time: 7 hours, 14 minutes. 7 hours, 14 minutes. She kept thinking about how it would only be a little over 7 hours before she would be relaxing in the sun and enjoying a stress-free vacation in Costa Rica. 7 hours, 14 minutes. The plane took off. Then, it dawned on her. A flight to Costa Rica shouldn't take 7 hours and 14 minutes. Furthermore, a flight to Costa Rica shouldn't be traveling south from her location. It was then that Samantha realized she was on the wrong flight, and she was traveling to Puerto Rico. Her mind flashed back to the night she booked the flight online, attempting to click her flight option with tears in her eyes. She had mistaken Puerto Rico for Costa Rica, and now she was on a non-stop, 7-hour, 14-minute flight to the wrong location. This was just the topping on a horrible year."},{"instruction":"Write a fictitious letter from a Neanderthal wife to her husband detailing a new idea she has come up with.

I know you are tired of my ideas now, especially after I lost my eyebrows in that fire fiasco, but wasn’t it worth it? We can make our own fire now. Mastodon meat tastes so much better after it has been seared. I know you agree. You’ve put on a little weight since I figured out how to make our own fires. And you also have to agree that the added benefit of the local dire wolf pack being terrified of fire keeps everyone much safer these days. Anyway, on to my new idea! I was walking down the old path where the best wild strawberries grow when I heard grunting and couldn’t see where it was coming from. I forgot to bring my spear (Yeah, yeah, I know, daydreamer me), so I crouched behind a boulder and listened for a few minutes. The sound was pretty close. I finally crept toward where it was coming from, and what do you think I saw? A big hole in the ground where a giant fir tree had been yanked right out. I’m sure it happened during that wild windstorm last week. I peeked over the edge, and there was a dire wolf cub. The poor thing was stuck. I know you think I’m too soft, but I couldn’t just leave it there. I just took a break to give Yip some berries. I know I should have come right home, but you would not have listened, and I wanted to keep Yip safe until you understood. I set up my own camp to figure things out. It’s been over 15 suns, but I needed the time for my idea! So, here it is. Wolves can be helpful!

On January 27, 1880, Thomas Edison received the historic patent embodying the principles of his incandescent lamp that paved the way for the universal domestic use of electric light. The Patent Office granted Thomas Edison a patent for his \\"electric-lamp.\\" Edison's patent was an improvement on electric lamps, not the invention of them; but because of Edison’s design changes and the materials he used—such as a carbon filament—his patent allowed for an electric lamp that was reliable, safe, and practical.

Line them up from the shortest sentence to the longest to make it look neat. About the Species Blue whales are the largest animals ever to live on our planet. They feed almost exclusively on krill, straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates (which hang from the roof of the mouth and work like a sieve). Some of the biggest individuals may eat up to 6 tons of krill a day. Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic Ocean. There are five currently recognized subspecies of blue whales. The number of blue whales today is only a small fraction of what it was before modern commercial whaling significantly reduced their numbers during the early 1900s, but populations are increasing globally. The primary threats blue whales currently face are vessel strikes and entanglements in fishing gear. NOAA Fisheries and its partners are dedicated to conserving and rebuilding blue whale populations worldwide. We use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and rescue these endangered animals. We engage our partners as we develop regulations and management plans that foster healthy fisheries and reduce the risk of entanglements, create whale-safe shipping practices, and reduce ocean noise. Population Status Blue whales were significantly depleted by commercial whaling activities worldwide. Today, blue whales are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The latest stock assessment reports of blue whales include data for various stocks, including areas of the North Pacific and western North Atlantic Oceans. Appearance Blue whales have a long body and generally slender shape. Their mottled blue-gray color appears light blue under water—hence their name, the blue whale. The mottling pattern is variable and can be used to identify individuals. Antarctic blue whales are generally larger than other blue whale subspecies. For example, in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, blue whales can grow up to about 90 feet and are over 100,000 pounds, but in the Antarctic, they can reach up to about 110 feet and weigh more than 330,000 pounds. Like many other baleen whales, female blue whales are generally larger than males. Behavior and Diet Blue whales sometimes swim in small groups but are more often found alone or in pairs. They generally spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the equatorial waters as winter arrives. Blue whales typically swim at about 5 miles an hour while they are feeding and traveling, but can accelerate to more than 20 miles an hour for short bursts. They are among the loudest animals on the planet, emitting a series of pulses, groans, and moans, and it is thought that in the right oceanographic conditions, sounds emitted by blue whales can be heard by other whales up to 1,000 miles away. Scientists think they use these vocalizations to communicate and—along with their excellent hearing—perhaps to sonar-navigate the dark ocean depths. The primary diet of blue whales is krill—tiny shrimp-like animals, but fish and copepods (tiny crustaceans) may occasionally be part of the blue whale’s diet. When blue whales hunt for food, they filter feed by swimming toward large schools of krill with their mouth open and closing their mouths around the krill while inflating their throat pleats. Once closed, blue whales then push the trapped water out of their mouth with their tongue and use their baleen plates to keep the krill trapped inside. Where They Live Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic. They generally migrate seasonally between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding grounds, but some evidence suggests that individuals in certain areas might not migrate at all. Information about distribution and movement varies with location, and migratory routes are not well known. In general, distribution is driven largely by food availability—they occur in waters where krill are concentrated. In the North Atlantic Ocean, their range extends from the subtropics to the Greenland Sea. Blue whales have been sighted in the waters off eastern Canada and in the shelf waters of the eastern United States. Along the West Coast of the United States, eastern North Pacific blue whales are believed to spend winters off of Mexico and Central America. They likely feed during summer off the U.S. West Coast and, to a lesser extent, in the Gulf of Alaska and central North Pacific waters. Blue whales with young calves are regularly observed in the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) from December through March. It is believed that this area is an important calving and nursing area for the species. In the northern Indian Ocean, there is a \\"resident\\" population. Blue whale sightings, strandings, and acoustic detections have been reported from the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and across the Bay of Bengal. The migratory movements of these whales are largely unknown but may be driven by oceanographic changes associated with monsoons. In the Southern Hemisphere, Antarctic blue whales occur mainly in relatively high latitude waters south of the \\"Antarctic Convergence\\" and close to the ice edge in summer. They generally migrate to middle and low latitudes in winter, although not all whales migrate each year. Pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda)—a subspecies—are typically distributed north of the Antarctic Convergence and are most abundant in waters off Australia, Madagascar, and New Zealand. An unnamed subspecies of blue whale is found in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, particularly in the Chiloense Ecoregion, and migrates to lower latitude areas, including the Galapagos Islands and the eastern tropical Pacific. Lifespan & Reproduction Blue whales’ average lifespan is estimated at around 80 to 90 years. Scientists can estimate the age of whales by counting the layers of wax-like earplugs collected from deceased animals. Scientists know little about the life history of the blue whale. The best available science suggests the gestation period is approximately 10 to 12 months. Weaning probably occurs at around 6 to 7 months on, or en route to, summer feeding areas. The age of sexual maturity is thought to be 5 to 15 years. Most reproductive activity, including births and mating, takes place during the winter. The average calving interval is probably 2 to 3 years. Threats Vessel Strikes Vessel strikes can injure or kill blue whales. Vessel strikes have killed blue whales throughout their range, but the risk is much higher in some coastal areas with heavy vessel traffic, like ports and in shipping lanes, and from larger vessels and vessels traveling at high speeds. Entanglement in Fishing Gear Blue whales can become entangled in fishing gear, either swimming off with the gear attached or becoming anchored. Blue whales can become entangled in many different gear types, including traps, pots, and nets. Once entangled, whales may drag the attached gear for long distances, ultimately resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury, which may lead to reduced reproductive success and death. Additional Threats Additional possible threats to blue whales that are less understood include ocean noise, habitat degradation, pollution, vessel disturbance, and climate change.","output":"- Blue whales are the largest animals on the planet. - A blue whale may eat up to 6 tons of krill in one day. - The only ocean where we cannot find blue whales is the Arctic. - Blue whales usually live alone or in pairs but sometimes live in small groups. - The diet of a blue whale consists mainly of krill, which they hunt by finding schools."},{"instruction":"I went from having a large gap in my college schedule where I could go back to my apartment and have lunch to having all my classes back to back.

I want these recommendations to give writers ideas of concrete steps to take when they're struggling with writers block, not too many abstract ideas. The target audience is people who are writing fiction novels rather than shorter projects or nonfiction works.","output":"Sure, I can help with that. Here are some things to do when you're struggling with writer's block: 1. Take a walk. Sometimes, getting your blood flowing and your heart pumping can serve to awaken new creative impulses in the brain. Bring a smartphone or notepad on your walk so you can jot down any ideas that come to mind while you're on the go. You may find it helpful to listen to music as you walk or do some pointed people-watching for inspiration. 2. Re-read your work. Sometimes, writer's block can be a symptom of feeling exhausted and discouraged. Writing a novel is a long and difficult undertaking, so while you're in the messy middle and yet to reap any of the rewards that come with a finished product, you may need to go back and re-read some of your earlier work to remind yourself how far you've come, feel proud of your progress, and get a better feel for the established pacing of your story. 3. Focus on outlines and planning. Writer's block isn't always a sign of creative burnout. Sometimes it's difficult to write what comes next because you don't really know where your story is going. You can use your time to focus on making a detailed outline that functions as a map, telling you exactly where to go next in your book. Alternatively, you could focus on drafting character or place names, fleshing out character profiles, solidifying worldbuilding elements, or any other practical logistics that need to be in place to make the world of your story feel real to readers. 4. Read a book by another author. There are two strategies you could take here. First, you could opt to read something by an author whose work inspires you to grow as an author, perhaps an author who does an exemplary job with some of your favorite aspects of fiction writing. On the flip side, though, great authors can sometimes serve to intimidate or discourage authors who are working on rough drafts, so you might prefer instead of pick up a book that is noticeably flawed. Reading a \\"bad\\" book can sometimes inspire writers by giving them confidence in their own abilities and demonstrating that perfectionism is not necessarily the key to getting published. 5. Talk to other writers. Writer's block happens to the best of us, and sometimes it can be helpful just to voice your concerns and frustrations out loud to someone who understands what you're struggling with. Other writers may also have suggestions that can help get you unstuck in your creative process. 6. Skip ahead to an exciting scene. If you're feeling stuck where you are, then go ahead and skip ahead to an upcoming scene that you're more excited about writing. Often, doing so will help to make it easier to fill in the blanks between what you've already written and the future scene you're excited about because when the future scene is fully fleshed out, it will be easier to determine what needs to happen in the plot to connect point A to point B. 7. Focus on editing. Sometimes it's hard to know where your story is going next because the earlier plot points you've written have backed you into a corner. Or, alternatively, maybe the parts of the story you've already written have left you with too many options for paths leading forward, an overabundance of Chekhov's guns and red herrings, too many characters, or an overly complicated story arc. It may be helpful to backtrack and edit the beginning of the story so that you can see a simpler trail leading from beginning to end."},{"instruction":"Generate a list of automated email messages that can be sent while I am out of my office on sabbatical until October 2023.

Use this text: The cycling of MNPs through the environment provides a multitude of opportunities for these particles to enter the human food chain (Fig. 1). For instance, MNP transport from wastewater effluent and biosolids to human food sources, the leaching of MNPs from food packaging, drinking water, aerosol intake and trophic transfer [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. While the dominant MNP intake pathways for humans remain undetermined, ingested food containing MNPs originating from food processing and packaging has recently been identified as a major intake pathway [[9], [10], [11]]. Evidence of MNP trophic transfer exists in aquatic organisms, particularly for smaller particles, although most MNPs likely pass through the digestive tract without further interaction [[15], [16], [17]]. MNP hotspots (i.e., local areas in an environment with particularly elevated MNP concentrations) which are co-located with nutrient- and biodiversity-rich areas, may cause considerable damage to marine ecosystems, and thus fish stocks [18,19]. MNP ingestion can lead to the transfer of toxic substances, such as plastic additives [19]. This may cause bioaccumulation of these substances in organisms which are later consumed by humans, potentially causing a food safety risk. Besides, MNP ingestion by organisms can lead to limited nutrient intake, cellular stress, inflammation, dysbiosis and reduced reproductive capability [[19], [20], [21], [22]]. This may impact the resilience and productivity of exposed ecological and agricultural systems posing a risk beyond food safety, affecting food security. The lack of research on MNPs ingestion and its effects on livestock and crops hinders the assessment of associated risks. However, the potential of plastisphere communities (i.e., microbial communities attached to plastic particles) to transport antibiotic resistance genes into agricultural soil is confirmed [23,24].

In calling for state funds to pay for private school tuition, whether through vouchers or tax credits, Gov. Kevin Stitt has usually mentioned children in low-income families as the target of his school choice push. Students in south Oklahoma City and north Tulsa are “trapped” in low-performing public schools, Stitt said, describing a single mother struggling to keep her son out of a local gang, or a paycheck-to-paycheck family unable to afford tutoring for a child struggling to read. “The rich folks already have school choice, they already have options,” said Stitt, who believes that the same choice should exist for families struggling to get by. But as the state Legislature considers a bill that would give refundable tax credits to parents with children in private schools, the governor and leaders in the House prefer a plan available to all Oklahomans, regardless of income. Allowing affluent families to have part of their private school tuition covered with state funds represents a shift within the school choice effort that had previously built its campaign around helping low-income families. Most states with some form of private school vouchers or tax credits, including Oklahoma, limit its use for students with special needs or living in poverty. Now some Republican-led states are pushing for “universal” voucher systems that would be open to all families, including those already paying for private school education. “This isn’t for low-income folks, at least not based on the proposal that’s being presented,” said Sen. Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City.","output":"A universal voucher system would allow more low-income Oklahoma families to choose to educate their children outside of public schools.

I'm not very good at baking and I want them to be portioned per guest.","output":"There are plenty of individual desserts you can make for guests without baking. Here are some ideas: 1. Individual Strawberry Trifles. This dessert consists of sponge cake, fruit, and custard layered in that order and displayed in a tall glass or dish. You can use a premade sponge or pound cake for an easy, bake-free dessert! This is a very versatile dessert because flavors can be mixed and matched in any way. They are perfect for entertaining because they can be scaled up or down. You can mix up the presentation by assembling this dessert in small highball glasses or mason jars, which are perfect for exact portioning. 2. No-Bake Peanut Butter Bars. These bars can be made with most ingredients you'd already find in your pantry. Salted butter, peanut butter, powdered sugar, vanilla wafers, and semi-sweet chocolate come together to make these decadent bars that guests will be sure to love. These bars only need to be cooled in the fridge for 1 hour before they can be cut into individual bars for portioned servings. If peanut allergies are a concern, some great alternatives are seed butter or other kinds of nut butter. The flavors will be similar. 3. Individual Key Lime Pies. Made with lime custard, graham cracker crust, and whipped cream, these will be sure to please your guests. In small individual serving dishes, flatten the graham cracker crust in the bottom, top with the key lime custard, and finish it with the whipped cream. Chill in the fridge until dessert is ready to be served. 4. Rice Krispie Treats. This is a classic dessert that will remind guests of their childhood. Marshmallow and rice krispie cereal mix together to form this all-original favorite. Combine the ingredients with salt and vanilla extract and form the mixture in a pan while hot. Let it sit at room temperature before cutting the rice krispie treats into individual squares. Separate the squares with wax paper so they do not stick together and are easy for guests to grab. 5. No-Bake Chocolate Oatmeal Cookies. A No-Bake interpretation of the classic chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. These cookies are made with brown sugar, cocoa powder, unsalted butter, almond butter, rolled oats, and chocolate chips. Simply combine all ingredients in a bowl and use an ice cream scooper to form them on a baking sheet, slightly flattening them into cookie shapes. Place in the freezer for 1 hour to set.

For all his life, Bridger had been planted in the shade of that hill shoeing horses, mending fences, and watching the seasons pass. It was not that Bridger was physically incapable of making the climb, thus keeping him below the ridge; it was because his parents—and their parents—spread warnings of the evil that waits on the other side. For in their mind, the hill was their protector; for Bridger, the hill was his captor. Today, Bridger was escaping. Finishing up his evening chores, Bridger snuck off from the stable and made his way into the woods where he stashed an overnight bag in some brush. The contents of his bag were slim, but he only planned to be gone until morning anyway. If he could catch a glimpse of whatever the sun would shine upon for him, he would be content. Content enough to put some time between this journey and the next, at least. Scrambling near the top of the hill, Bridger began to rely on all four of his limbs to carry his weight up the ridge. The brush became prickly and sharp, almost as if it were barbed wire placed atop a prison yard’s fence. One of the branches caught his backpack and tore it open, leaving what little he brought spilled over the hillside. Bridger dropped his shredded backpack and continued upward. A faint light began to glow in the low clouds. Bridger was close. A few more steps and the view he has dreamed of would present itself to him. Finally, cresting the rocky top of the hill, Bridger could nearly cast his gaze down upon the other side of the hill. Questions began spinning in his mind: Are there people down there? Do they know we exist nearby? What if my family was right? The final question surprised Bridger. He thought for sure he had purged their worries from his mine, but there it was. Ignoring the sudden doubt, Bridger could see the other side. Bridger never returned to the stables. His family went searching for him and found his torn open backpack—but nothing else. The family knew where he had gone—and they knew who had found him."},{"instruction":"How many seasons of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel are there? When did the final season premiere?

The three main macronutrients, namely carbs, protein, and fat, play specific roles in providing energy and supporting muscle function during workouts. Carbohydrates are important for short and high-intensity exercises, as they fuel your muscles by replenishing glycogen stores. Protein consumption before exercise can enhance muscle protein synthesis, leading to benefits such as increased muscle mass, improved recovery, and enhanced performance. While fat serves as a source of fuel for longer and moderate-to-low intensity exercises, the effects of fat intake specifically before exercise require further research.

Who influenced his solos? Guitarist Eddie Hazel from Funkadelic is notable for his solo improvisation (particularly for the solo on \\"Maggot Brain\\") and guitar riffs, the tone of which was shaped by a Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone pedal.[35] Hazel, along with guitarist Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers, was influenced by Jimi Hendrix's improvised, wah-wah infused solos. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Hendrix, when Hendrix was a part of the Isley Brothers backing band and temporarily lived in the Isleys' household.","output":"Eddie Hazel was the guitarist for Funkadelic.

Hi [Name], thanks for letting me know. I checked degree works and it says that ENGR 360 is counting towards my design course (instead of design and tech elective) when I already took a design course. Will you be able to fix that? Also, just to make sure, all of these classes will allow me to graduate next fall, correct? Because I need to have all of my design and tech electives done in order to be able to finish. Thank you for your help, [Your Name]","output":"Hi, thanks for letting me know.

Countries across Asia have seen extreme heat in recent weeks. In northwest Thailand, the temperature hit 45.4C on 15 April, while in Laos it reached 42.7C. In Bangladesh, the capital Dhaka saw the mercury rise above 40C, believed to be the hottest day in 58 years. Another factor likely to influence weather across the world over the coming months is the likely onset of an El Niño event. This will see more heat emerge in the Pacific ocean off the coast of Peru. If it happens, then 2024 might emerge as the world's warmest year on record, with more storms, fires and floods. \\"It seems we are living in a world of a new normal here,\\" said Dr Fahad Saeed, from research organisation, Climate Analytics.","output":"1.

Customer: I paid for expedited shipping and my item is already one week late. What is the issue? I would appreciate my rush shipping charge refunded. This is unacceptable. Customer Service Representative: I have looked into your order details and cannot identify why the shipment is held up. I am unable to refund the rush charge due to the delay not being due to our shipping. We shipped your product on the following business day as you can view on your tracking information. So, the holdup has occurred with one of our carrier partners which is beyond our control. There is nothing I can do on my part to speed things up. 2. Customer: When will Part #A431 be in stock? I have a huge project and need a dozen of them ASAP. Customer Service Representative: We do have an order scheduled to arrive on April 14th. Being that you are one of our longstanding customers, I will ensure that your on-hold order is expedited as soon as we receive the part. An email and text will then be sent to you, notifying you of the progress along with a discount on your next order for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 3. Customer: I need to make a complaint about one of your employees who was very rude at one of your brick-and-mortar stores. Customer Service Representative: I am not capable of taking complaints regarding employees at actual stores, unfortunately. You will need to make a complaint with a manager at the site and they will then take further action, if necessary. I hope this will help. I'm sorry I cannot be of more help.","output":"I have classified the customer service representatives' responses. Please let me know if you would like any further elaboration on my classifications. 1. Bad - The CSR should have offered their condolences that the customer's shipment was running late. The rush charge should have been refunded to the customer; if that was not possible, another form of compensation or discount could have been offered. Finally, the customer should have been provided with information regarding a follow-up along with another apology before ending the conversation. 2. Excellent - The CSR was direct and honest. They acknowledged the customer's time with them and rewarded this by expediting their order when the part is back in stock. They also informed them that progress will be updated via text and email, as well as offering the customer a discount for the inconvenience. They ended with a question, asking if there was anything further the customer needed help with. This is an ideal response regarding this particular situation. 3. Good - Although the CSR was direct and did apologize, there were multiple actions they could have taken to elevate the response to an excellent one. The CSR could have possibly phoned the store and initiated a three-way call between the CSR, the customer, and the manager. If this was not an option, the CSR should have offered to give the customer more information about the store in question. The representative also could have offered the customer a discount or another form of compensation for the customer's dilemma."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},F=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function E(a,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(n(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(n(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+u(o.searchQuery)+'".
