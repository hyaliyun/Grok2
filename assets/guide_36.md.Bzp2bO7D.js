A clade is a taxonomic group of organisms consisting of a single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor.

Some researchers have tried to clarify the idea of race by equating it to the biological idea of the clade. Often mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome sequences are used to study ancient human migration paths. These singlelocus sources of DNA do not recombine and are inherited from a single parent. Individuals from the various continental groups tend to be more similar to one another than to people from other continents, and tracing either mitochondrial DNA or nonrecombinant Ychromosome DNA explains how people in one place may be largely derived from people in some remote location.

It's easy to accumulate clothes over time and find yourself in a situation where you have far more than you need. However, decluttering your wardrobe is essential to stay organized, save time when getting dressed, and make your closet space more functional. To begin, start by removing all of your clothes from your closet. This process may take some time, but it's necessary to see everything you have and sort through it properly. Once you've emptied your closet, take time to assess each piece of clothing. Decide which clothes you want to keep, which ones you will store, and which ones you will donate or throw out. The clothes you keep should be the ones you know you'll wear frequently or those with a high sentimental value. The clothes you decide to store should be items you don't need right now but may use in the future. Consider keeping them in plastic containers or vacuum-sealed bags to protect them from dust and moisture. Once you've decided on the items you'll keep and store, it's time to address the clothes you'll donate or throw away. Be honest with yourself about what you no longer need. Clothing that is stained, worn out or no longer fits should be donated or thrown away. After sorting your clothes, take a moment to clean the inside of your closet. Wipe down shelves, vacuum or sweep the floor, and dust all surfaces. This step will not only make your closet look nicer but also offer a clean environment for your clothes. In conclusion, cleaning and organizing your closet can be a daunting task, but it's worth it in the end. Take the time to sort through your clothes, deciding which ones to keep, store, donate, or throw away. And don't forget to clean your closet thoroughly before returning your clothes. This process will help you stay organized and create a more functional closet space."},{"instruction":"eritage buildings constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras showcase IndoIslamic architecture influenced by Medieval, Mughal and European styles.

For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and longtime friend and collaborator of Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine, both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy – the dominant strain of philosophy in Englishspeaking countries in the 20th century. Whitehead has also had highprofile admirers in the continental tradition, such as French poststructuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that he stands provisionally as the last great AngloAmerican philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror.

Currently, women who carry the BRCA1 mutation are advised to have their ovaries removed by the time they turn 40, as this reduces their risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology has found that women who wait until after the age of 35 to have the surgery are five times more likely to develop ovarian cancer than those who have the procedure before they turn 35. This is significant because it means that women who are considering this surgery may want to move up their timeline for preventative care. While there are many factors to consider when making medical decisions like this, the data suggests that earlier is better when it comes to preventing ovarian cancer. It's worth noting that the surgery is not without risk and side effects. For women who have not yet had children, removing the ovaries will bring on early menopause, which can increase the risk of other health problems like osteoporosis and heart disease. However, for women who have already had children or who do not plan to have children, the procedure can be a lifesaving preventative measure. Ultimately, the decision to have preventative surgery is a personal one and should be made in consultation with a trusted healthcare provider. However, this new research provides important information for women who are considering their options and want to make an informed decision about their health."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: car, race, tur","output":"During the race, the car made a sudden turn causing it to spin out of control."},{"instruction":"Good little local pizza place.

An example: How long will it take for 100 to assume the purchasing power of 50, given an inflation rate of 5% per year? Let 5 x T = 72, so that T = 72 ÷ 5 = 14.4. That's how many years it would take for money to lose half its buying power in a period of 5% inflation. (If the inflation rate were to change from year to year, you would have to use the average inflation rate that existed over the full time period.) R = 72 ÷ T. Enter a value for T, and solve for R. For example: If the buying power of 100 becomes 50 in ten years, what is the inflation rate during that time? R x 10 = 72, where T = 10. Then R = 72 ÷ 10 = 7.2%.","output":"The formula T = 72 ÷ R is used to calculate how long it takes for money to lose half its buying power based on the inflation rate R.

The training program is taking place in Pakistan's tribal region, which shares a border with Afghanistan. Ethnic Pashtuns comprise the majority of the Frontier Corps, and they are recruited from the tribal region itself. This makes it particularly important for them to receive the most effective training possible to fight against these groups that are known for their fierce hold on the region. The Frontier Corps has been involved in conducting several military operations aimed at eradicating extremist groups from the tribal areas. Their efforts have often been met with severe resistance from the militants who utilize the difficult geography and local support to their advantage. The U.S military's involvement in the training of the Frontier Corps marks a significant step in the cooperation between the two countries in their ongoing fight against terrorism. It also highlights the crucial role that Pakistan plays in the region's security. Pakistan has been a longstanding ally of the United States in its efforts to combat terrorism.

As the home favourite, Monfils is expected to receive all the support from the crowd at Roland Garros, while Murray may once again be subjected to boos and jeers as he plays the role of the villain. This won't be the first time Murray has experienced a hostile reception at the French Open. In 2012, he faced off against Frenchman Richard Gasquet and was booed after coming back from two sets down to win the match. The incident caused quite a stir and left Murray feeling flustered and bewildered. Now, as he prepares to go up against Monfils, Murray must brace himself for a similar reaction. Monfils is the last remaining Frenchman in the draw, and as such, he is sure to have the full backing of the home crowd. Murray, however, has acknowledged that he must stay focused on the game, and not let the crowd's reaction affect his performance on the court. In their previous meetings on tour, Murray has a slender 3-2 lead over Monfils. However, it's worth bearing in mind that Monfils' unorthodox playing style and athleticism could make him a tricky opponent for the Briton. Regardless, Murray will be fully prepared for the challenge that lies ahead, and will be aiming to progress to the semi-finals of the French Open for the first time since 2017. In the end, whether Murray is cheered or jeered by the French crowd, he knows that his focus must remain unwavering if he is to emerge victorious.

A line of trees or some foliage low on the ground may also hint at a creek bed or some other body of water. Some examples of these include valleys, depressions, or crevices.

With more than 90% of its budget reliant on oil, and around 80% of its exports flowing through the strait, the Iraqi government is exploring alternatives to keep its economy afloat. One of the solutions involves the use of old pipelines to transport crude to the Red Sea port of Aqaba in Jordan. These pipelines were built in the 1980s and stopped being used during the first Gulf War. However, they are still in working condition and could be revitalized to create a new export route for Iraq's oil. Another option being considered is to build a new pipeline that goes from Basra, Iraq's main oil producing region, to the Syrian port of Banias. This pipeline would allow Iraq to bypass the Strait of Hormuz completely and export its oil through Syria instead. The Iraqi government is also looking into the development of new oil fields in the country to diversify its export routes. By creating more export options, Iraq hopes to reduce its reliance on the Strait of Hormuz and mitigate the risk of a potential closure. However, these contingency plans come with their own set of challenges. Reviving the old pipelines and building new ones will require significant investment, and the political situation in Jordan and Syria may pose additional obstacles. Despite these challenges, Iraq is determined to ensure the stability of its economy and reduce its vulnerability to any external shocks that may affect its oil exports.

However, there are certain body language cues to look out for that can give you some insight into your date's feelings. Here are some things to pay attention to: First, watch out for any leaning toward you. If your date is leaning in, it's a good sign that they are interested in what you have to say and are actively engaged in the conversation. Similarly, pay attention to how your date is positioning their arms. If their arms are crossed, it could be a sign that they are closed off or not interested in continuing the conversation. Next, take a look at your date's feet. If they are pointed toward you, it indicates that they are focused on you and interested in what you have to say. Additionally, if you notice any mirrored movements (meaning you both move or gesture in the same way), it could be a sign that there is a connection between you. Fidgeting can also give you some insight into your date's feelings. If your date is fidgeting, it could be a sign of nervousness or excitement. Alternatively, if your date is calm and relaxed, it could indicate that they are more comfortable around you. Eye contact is another important factor to consider. If your date is making frequent eye contact, it shows that they are interested in you and what you are saying. On the other hand, if they are avoiding eye contact, it could be a sign that they are not interested in continuing the conversation. Pay attention to how your date holds their purse or bag as well. If they hold it close to their body or tightly, it could be a sign of discomfort or unease. On the other hand, if they are more relaxed with their belongings, it could indicate that they feel comfortable around you. Finally, watch for any physical contact. If your date brushes up against you or touches your arm, it's a good sign that they are interested in you. Similarly, pay attention to their lips. Are they smiling or laughing? If so, it's a sign that they are enjoying themselves and having a good time. In conclusion, paying attention to someone's body language can help you gain insight into their feelings and interest level. By watching out for these cues, you can better understand your date's behavior and whether or not they are interested in getting to know you better."},{"instruction":"Nitra Castle at Night pictures photos facts and information on Nitra Castle at Night Nitra Please fix the punctuation.","output":"Nitra Castle at Night - pictures, photos, facts, and information on Nitra Castle at Night, Nitra."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = Alimentum, eatType = restaurant, food = Fast food, priceRange = cheap, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes.

Because the Sun is a luminous disc as seen from the Earth, rather than a point source of light, sunrise and sunset are not instantaneous and the exact definition of both can vary with context.

I am so scared of going to prison and thought if I handed in the letter it would buy a bit of time'","output":"In recent news, a KFC worker has admitted to forging notes from her boss and GP in order to have time off from work. Despite her actions being illegal, she confessed that her fear of going to prison led her to make a grave mistake. The worker stated, \\"I was stupid. I hold my hand up to it. I am so scared of going to prison and thought if I handed in the letter it would buy a bit of time.\\" This admission highlights the severe consequences that individuals face when they make impulsive decisions, particularly those that involve fraudulent activities. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Employees often feel pressure to fabricate reasons for time off or falsely claim sick leave, leading to a culture of dishonesty within the workplace. It is essential to recognize the severity of such actions and the impact they can have on both an individual's career and the company they work for. Employers must provide a safe space for their employees to be transparent about their personal and professional lives, which should eliminate the need for fraudulent behavior. When employees feel valued and respected, they are less likely to make deceitful decisions. Additionally, companies must invest in training and education to ensure that their staff understands the consequences of fraudulent actions and actively discourages such behavior. In conclusion, the KFC worker's actions highlight the importance of honesty and transparency in the workplace. It is essential for employers to create a work environment where employees feel comfortable being truthful and owning up to their mistakes. By investing in education and training, companies can foster a culture of trust and prevent situations like this from happening in the future."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Spain could revert to playing without a striker against Chile. Diego Costa may be dropped after a poor performance against Holland. Cesc Fabregas could play in the 'false nine' position for the Group B clash. Sergio Ramos must lead by example for La Roja.","output":"Spain's coach Vicente del Bosque has hinted that his team could revert to their successful 'false nine' system in the Group B clash against Chile. After a disappointing loss against Holland in their opener, Spain are under pressure to get a result against Chile and Del Bosque is considering dropping Diego Costa, who struggled to make an impact in their previous game. Barcelona's versatile midfielder Cesc Fabregas is likely to take up the 'false nine' role, a position he has played successfully for both club and country, should Del Bosque choose to abandon the traditional striker. This would allow Spain to bring in an extra midfielder, reinforcing their dominance in possession and improving defensive cohesion. However, the key to Spain's success may not only be tactical. Defender Sergio Ramos will need to take on a greater leadership role if Spain are to bounce back from their defeat and progress in the tournament. Ramos is one of the most experienced members of the squad and his ability to keep the Chilean attack at bay will be vital. La Roja will be looking to their talismanic captain to lead by example and restore the winning mentality that has underpinned their previous successes. In conclusion, the Spain national team will need to adapt their game in order to overcome a resolute Chilean side. Dropping Diego Costa and adopting the 'false nine' could give them the edge they need, but ultimately it will be the attitude and performance of experienced players such as Sergio Ramos that could make the difference between success and failure."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Evaluation of limitations on total sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury emissions that start in 2018.

Initially the Canal was opposed by the British; but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the jugular vein of the Empire.

Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage. Joint AngloFrench financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882. The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position, but a compromise was reached with the 1888 Convention of Constantinople, which made the Canal officially neutral territory.

The incident occurred when Baukus, who prosecutors at the time slammed as an \\"overindulgent party girl,\\" was driving while intoxicated and under the influence of drugs. Baukus was charged with two counts of intoxication manslaughter, two counts of intoxication assault, and one count of failure to stop and render aid. The trial lasted for several weeks, and jurors heard testimony from not only the defendant but also her father and friends, all of whom attested to the fact that Baukus was not someone who would normally engage in such dangerous behavior. Despite the testimony, however, the evidence presented was too damning to ignore, and Baukus was ultimately found guilty on all counts. She faced up to 60 years in jail, a sentence that would undoubtedly have changed the trajectory of her life forever. In a separate case, the Texas sports bar that had served Baukus prior to her getting behind the wheel and causing the fatal accident settled with the victims for a whopping 1 million. This development highlighted the growing concern about the role that establishments that serve alcohol play in such incidents. Ultimately, the case serves as a grim reminder of the dangers of drunk driving and the consequences of engaging in such reckless behavior.

The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making highvoltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy. Q: What order is the breakdown field strength for air dielectric capacitors of?","output":"The breakdown field strength for air dielectric capacitors is of the order 2 to 5 MV/m."},{"instruction":"Complete the passage.

The move by the banking giant is aimed at supporting and appreciating different people and cultures from around the world. The revamped machines feature images of people from diverse backgrounds as well as symbols that represent different cultures. ANZ Bank hopes that the redesigned machines will send a message of inclusiveness and respect to all people, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, or gender. However, the company has come under fire after being criticised for profiting from civil rights issues. Some critics argue that while ANZ Bank claims to promote diversity and equality, it is still making money off the very same social issues that it purports to support. In response to these criticisms, ANZ Bank has defended its actions, arguing that promoting diversity and equality is a long-term commitment that requires continuous effort and investment. The company has also pledged to donate a portion of its profits to organisations that support civil rights and social justice. In conclusion, ANZ Bank's initiative to redesign its machines during the celebration of diversity and equality is a step in the right direction towards creating an inclusive society. While the company's critics have raised valid concerns, it is important to acknowledge that promoting diversity and equality is a complex and challenging task that requires the involvement of all stakeholders, including businesses like ANZ Bank. The key is to remain open to feedback, listen to voices from all sides, and continue to take meaningful action towards building a more equitable and just society."},{"instruction":"What happens next in this paragraph?

One key measure of economic performance is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate, which indicates how fast an economy is expanding. In 2008, the U.S. GDP growth rate was 2.7%. However, in 2009, the GDP growth rate dropped significantly to -2.8%, a decrease of 5.5 percentage points. This decline in GDP growth rate was primarily due to reduced spending by consumers and businesses, as well as decreased exports. The financial crisis led many people to lose their jobs and caused widespread economic uncertainty, which caused individuals and businesses to spend less money. The government responded to the crisis by implementing measures such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which provided funding for infrastructure projects and other initiatives to stimulate the economy. It took several years for the U.S. economy to fully recover from the financial crisis, and the GDP growth rate did not return to pre-crisis levels until 2012. In conclusion, the GDP growth rate dropped by 5.5 percentage points between 2008 and 2009 due to the global financial crisis. While the government's response helped to mitigate the damage, it took several years for the U.S. economy to fully recover."},{"instruction":"Review: is bright and flashy Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

Genetic pollution leads to homogenization or replacement of local genomes as a result of either a numerical and/or fitness advantage of an introduced species. Hybridization and introgression are sideeffects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to rare species that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its gene pool. This problem is not always apparent from morphological (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of gene flow is normal adaptation, and not all gene and genotype constellations can be preserved.

The father of the young girl was moved when he witnessed how Williams interacted with his daughter, saying that \\"it was the most moving thing I've seen in my life.\\" Williams' selflessness is a reminder that aside from his impressive acting skills, he left a legacy of kindness and compassion.

In times where the world can be harsh and unkind, Williams' action serves as a beacon of hope and an inspiration for many.

Many children develop flight fears, and it is essential to offer support and guidance to help them overcome it. The first step is to ask your child about their fears. Listening to their concerns can help you understand what is causing their fear and how you can help. Additionally, providing them with information on how planes fly can help ease their anxiety. It can be helpful to explain that planes are designed to fly and are rigorously tested for safety. The next step is to let the child see airplanes in action to help them become familiar with the experience. Take them to the airport or watch videos of planes taking off and landing. This exposure can make it easier for them to understand what it would be like to be on a plane. It is also important to talk about all the people that work to make flying safe. Highlighting the roles of pilots, air traffic controllers, and other professionals can help reassure your child that flying is safe. Emphasizing \\"gradual desensitization\\" is key to helping a child overcome their fear. This means gradually exposing them to the situations that cause their fear until they become desensitized to it. For example, if your child is afraid of the sound of the engine or the feeling of take-off, you can simulate the experience through videos, games, and other fun activities. In conclusion, helping your child overcome their fear of flying can be a challenging but rewarding process. By asking questions, offering information, and gradually exposing them to the experience, you can help alleviate their anxiety and make flying a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for the whole family."},{"instruction":"f A little boy with a yellow shovel is playing with dirt., can we conclude He is on vacation with his family?

This means that the median income of a male was 10,157 higher than the median income of a female. The gender pay gap is a well-documented phenomenon, with women earning less than men for doing the same job. This can be attributed to a variety of factors, including occupational segregation, discrimination, and the fact that women often take on more caregiving responsibilities, which can lead to interrupted career paths and less opportunity for advancement. While progress has been made in closing the gender pay gap over the years, there is still work to be done to ensure that women are paid fairly for their work. This includes policies such as pay transparency, strengthening anti-discrimination laws, and encouraging companies to offer flexible work arrangements that allow for a better work-life balance. In conclusion, the median income of a male was 10,157 higher than the median income of a female in 2019, highlighting the ongoing issue of the gender pay gap.

Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources. His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism.

Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when MarieAntoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been led in triumph during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on MarieAntoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.

Recently, the idyllic peace of the area was shattered when two teenagers broke into his mansion. This incident has highlighted the issue of property crime in the area and the vulnerability of the residents of Mill House Care Home. The Mill House Care Home only houses three young people who are described as 'extremely vulnerable'. These residents are in need of special care and protection from the community. It is therefore disconcerting that such an incident could happen in such close proximity to the care home, potentially endangering the welfare of these young people. It is essential for communities to take special measures to ensure the safety and well-being of their most vulnerable members. This can range from simple measures like setting up neighbourhood watch programs or CCTV systems, to working with local authorities to improve the overall security of the area. In the case of Mr Challis and Mill House Care Home, it is clear that there is a pressing need for the community to work together to prevent incidents like this from happening again. The incident serves as a reminder that vigilance, attentiveness, and cooperation are important not just for one person's security but for the sake of the entire community.

However, he did assure the public that the government would continue to prioritize tracking down and punishing terrorists who pose a threat to the UK. Cameron condemned the \\"appalling and heinous crimes\\" committed by Emwazi and other ISIS militants, emphasizing that they would not go unpunished. He also defended the actions of MI5, which has faced criticism over whether or not they knew about Emwazi's involvement with ISIS prior to his identification. Many speculate that the Prime Minister's reluctance to confirm Emwazi's identity is due to concerns over national security and potential implications for ongoing counterterrorism efforts. The UK has been deeply affected by recent terrorist attacks, including the Manchester bombing in 2017 and the London Bridge attack in 2019. Despite these challenges, Cameron affirmed his commitment to protecting the people of Britain and bringing those responsible for acts of terrorism to justice.

Learn more about thyroid nodules. Be aware of thyroiditis.","output":"Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland and often results in overactive thyroid hormone production. One of the most common complications associated with Grave's disease is Grave's ophthalmopathy - a condition that affects the eyes. Grave's ophthalmopathy causes swelling and inflammation of the tissues around the eyes, resulting in a range of symptoms, which may include redness, swelling, and a feeling of pressure behind the eyes. In severe cases, ophthalmopathy can lead to vision loss or double vision. It is crucial to be aware of the symptoms associated with Grave's ophthalmopathy so that patients can receive prompt medical attention before any vision loss occurs. Regular visits with an endocrinologist can help monitor and prevent the progression of the disease. Another concern with Grave's disease is the development of thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules are lumps that form within the thyroid gland, and they are common in people with Grave's disease. While the vast majority of thyroid nodules are benign, some may be cancerous. It is essential to have any suspicious nodules checked out by a physician, who may order a biopsy to determine if the nodule is cancerous. Finally, Grave's disease can also cause thyroiditis, which is inflammation of the thyroid gland. This may result in a temporary or permanent decrease in thyroid hormone production. It is essential for patients with Grave's disease to be aware of this possible complication, as it may require medication to manage thyroid hormone levels.

To achieve this, it is important to match the dialogue with the motivations and personalities of the characters. For example, a shy and introverted character may speak with more hesitance and use fewer words than an outgoing and confident character. In addition, every story needs a clear beginning, middle, and end. The beginning should set the stage, introduce characters and their motivations, and establish the conflict. The middle should develop the conflict and build tension, while the end should resolve the conflict and provide a satisfying conclusion. Furthermore, incorporating a character arc is essential to creating a compelling story. This arc should show the character's growth, development, and change over the course of the story. For example, a character who is initially selfish and callous may learn empathy and compassion as the story progresses, making the character more likable and relatable to readers.
