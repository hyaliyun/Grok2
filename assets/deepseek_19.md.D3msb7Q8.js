Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera is not one of the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease.

The win came shortly after midfielder Samir Nasri had stated that players would be sold if they did not improve. However, the club has handed long-term contracts to most of their squad, suggesting that they are backing their current group of players to turn things around. This approach differs from that of Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who regularly sold key players in order to refresh his squad. City, on the other hand, are currently too reliant on their core group of players to consider such moves at this stage. It remains to be seen whether this approach will pay off in the long run. The win over Bayern Munich, which saw Sergio Aguero score two late goals, will certainly have boosted confidence within the City camp. However, the team's performances so far this season have left much to be desired, and there is clearly work to be done in order to bring the side back to its best. Fans will be hoping that the win over Bayern Munich marks the beginning of a turnaround in City's fortunes, and that the club's squad will justify the faith that has been put in them by signing those long-term contracts.

Specificity theory saw pain as a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses. Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists.

Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous whodunnit, quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery. It also makes sense in the end, a big plus, 'cause that's not always the case for these giallo's, as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless redherrings and ultimate solutions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better. Pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography, the catchy music score, the gorgeous females (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few. In most parts it's decently acted, Goerge Hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well. Martino directs with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces.

The 4 S's are a good place to start: See, Swirl, Sniff, Sip. These four steps help you engage all your senses and really get to know the wine you're drinking. Another important aspect to consider is the tannins and terroir. Tannins are the naturally occurring compounds found in grapes that give wine its bitterness and structure. Understanding tannins and how they affect the taste of wine can help you appreciate different varietals and vintages. Terroir, on the other hand, refers to the environmental factors that influence the grapes, such as soil type, climate, and altitude. Knowing a wine's terroir can give you insight into its flavor profile and make it easier to pair with food. Temperature is also important when it comes to wine. Different types of wine should be served at different temperatures to bring out their best qualities. For example, white wines should be chilled to around 45-50°F, while red wines are best served at around 60-65°F. Using the right glass can also make a big difference in the taste of your wine. The shape and size of the glass can affect how the wine hits your palate and how the aromas are released. It's also important to know how to hold the glass properly so that you don't warm the wine too quickly with your hands. Finally, take some time to familiarize yourself with how to describe a wine's aroma. Learning the language of wine can help you better understand its nuances and appreciate its complexity. In conclusion, by keeping these key things in mind - the 4 S's, tannins and terroir, temperature, glassware, and aroma - you can enhance your wine drinking experience and gain a deeper appreciation for the wonderful world of wine."},{"instruction":"f A woman with glasses is giving a presentation to two women sitting down., does it logically follow that A woman is giving a sales pitch to sell makeup to her friends.?

He broke the previous record by converting a 64-yard field goal on December 8, 2013, in Denver Broncos' match against Tennessee Titans at the Sports Authority Field at Mile High stadium in Denver. His previous record was 63 yards, which he had achieved twice before: first on December 2, 2012, and then on October 12, 2014. By subtracting Prater's second-longest field goal from his record of 64 yards, we can determine the difference. So, 64 - 63 = 1. Therefore, Prater's longest field goal was only 1 yard longer than his second longest. However, even a difference of 1 yard in a field goal can make a huge impact on the game's outcome. It is worth mentioning that Prater is not the only kicker in the NFL who has hit a 63-yarder. Jason Elam, Sebastian Janikowski, and David Akers hold the second place for the longest field goal accomplishment in NFL history, each with a 63-yarder. Nonetheless, Prater's 64-yard field goal stands out as the longest successful field goal kick in NFL history, and it has definitely earned him a well-deserved place in the football hall of fame."},{"instruction":"The dermis is the inner layer of skin.

In addition to this, she has been fined £130 million in damages to the state. The verdict has been met with significant criticism, including from the European Union, which has condemned the trial as politically motivated.

The case against Tymoshenko dates back to her time as Prime Minister, when she was accused of signing a natural gas deal with Russia that was deemed unfavorable to Ukraine. Tymoshenko has denied any wrongdoing in the case. The verdict is likely to further strain Ukraine's relationship with the European Union, which has been pushing for political reforms in the country.

She has called for a fair appeal process, and has urged her supporters to remain peaceful in their protests. The case against Tymoshenko is seen by many as a test of Ukraine's commitment to democracy and the rule of law.

The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is nonlinear and normal (i.e., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence.

James I granted the city new charters of law, the Furs of Valencia, which later were extended to the whole kingdom of Valencia.

In the National Football League (NFL), the shortest touchdown pass is one yard. A touchdown is scored when the football is carried or caught into the opposing team's end zone. A pass that is caught in the end zone by a teammate results in a touchdown as well. The one-yard touchdown pass is not a common occurrence in the NFL, as teams usually try to gain more yardage before attempting a pass into the end zone. However, there are times when a one-yard touchdown pass is necessary, such as in goal-line situations where the offense is close to scoring but has little room to work with. In addition to the NFL, other football leagues such as the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the NCAA also have a one-yard minimum for a touchdown pass. Overall, the shortest touchdown pass in football is one yard, and while it may not happen often, it is a crucial play that can make all the difference in a game."},{"instruction":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

Initially the Canal was opposed by the British; but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the jugular vein of the Empire. In 1875, the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli bought the indebted Egyptian ruler Isma'il Pasha's 44 percent shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4 million (£340 million in 2013).

On Sunday night, the officer lost his life in the line of duty when a man opened fire in the area. The shooter was later discovered dead on Monday afternoon, ending a 20-hour standoff that took place after the suspect barricaded himself in a house. The incident is a somber reminder of the risks that law enforcement officers take on a daily basis. The death of the officer has left the community in shock and mourning. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and details are still emerging. The identity of the shooter, Ricky Coley, has been confirmed by the police dispatcher. It is unclear at this time what caused Coley to open fire, and whether there was any previous history between him and the victim. The 20-hour standoff that followed the shooting was a tense and dangerous situation for all involved. Law enforcement officials worked tirelessly to negotiate with the suspect and ultimately bring the situation to a resolution. The discovery of the shooter's lifeless body on Monday afternoon brought an end to the standoff, but raised more questions about what led to the tragic event.

The scandal, which rocked the political landscape, has resurfaced once again as the memoir of his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was released. Hillary Clinton admitted that the White House affair with Lewinsky was “difficult,” but she said that she has long forgiven her husband for his mistakes. In fact, Clinton said that she has “moved on” from the incident and has focused on her career in public service instead. Her memoir, Hard Choices, chronicles her experiences as Secretary of State during the administration of President Barack Obama. The book presents a look at the complexities of international relations and how the US should navigate them, with Clinton’s experience providing valuable insight. Despite the focus on her time as Secretary of State, the timing of Hillary Clinton’s book release could not have been more coincidental. Her memoir has rekindled public interest in the infamous White House affair, which was a low point in the couple’s marriage. However, the former First Lady has made it clear that she’s keen to focus on the lessons learned during her time in office and the accomplishments she achieved for the country, rather than dwell on the past. The release of her memoir is a testament to that, offering readers an inside look into the mind of a world leader and a champion of democracy. The Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair may have been one of the most well-known scandals in US politics, but Hillary Clinton has proven that she is much more than the wife of a former President. With her memoir, she underscores her own legacy as someone who devoted her life to public service, and who continues to inspire others to do the same."},{"instruction":"The bullsnake (Pituophis catenifer sayi) is a large nonvenomous colubrid snake.

To get the most benefit from stretching, it's important to know which muscles need to be targeted and the right type of stretch for them. One effective way to stretch several muscles, especially in the legs, is through lunge stretches. This type of stretch targets the hip flexors, quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. To do a lunge stretch, start by standing with your feet hip-width apart. Take a big step forward with one foot, keeping your back foot firmly planted and your toes pointing forward. Lower your hips towards the ground by bending both knees, making sure the front knee is directly above the ankle, and the back knee is hovering just above the ground. Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds before switching to the other leg. Repeat the movement three to five times on each side. Aside from the physical benefits of stretching, it also helps you to mentally prepare for your workout or activity. It allows you to focus on your breathing and let go of any tension, clearing your mind and getting you ready to perform at your best. In conclusion, stretching is crucial for any fitness routine, and lunges are an excellent way to target several muscle groups at once.

Ask participants to pray on specific passages to find deeper meaning.","output":"Evangelism is an integral part of Christianity as it involves proclaiming the good news of the Gospel and inviting people to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior. Understanding what the Bible says about evangelism is important in order to effectively carry out this mission. During discussions about evangelism, participants should first be encouraged to find passages in the Bible that specifically address the topic. Some key verses include Mark 16:15, which says, \\"And he said to them, 'Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.'\\" Another important passage is Matthew 28:19-20, where Jesus instructs his disciples, \\"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.\\" Once participants have identified relevant passages, they should be asked to explain what the passage means to them in their own words. Doing this helps to facilitate a deeper understanding of the text and encourages participants to think about how they can apply it to their own lives. Finally, participants should be encouraged to pray on specific passages in order to find deeper meaning. This practice helps to connect individuals with God and allows them to gain a greater understanding of his will for their lives. In conclusion, discussions about evangelism should focus on identifying relevant passages in the Bible, explaining their meaning, and praying for a deeper understanding. By doing so, participants can gain a greater appreciation for the importance of evangelism and can effectively carry out this vital mission."},{"instruction":"The Chullachaki (Quechua, onefooted, from chulla or ch'ulla = single, odd, unpaired, asymmetric, chaki = foot; spelling sometimes also used in Spanish) or Chullachaqui (hispanicized spelling), also known as the Shapishico, is a mythical forest creature of the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazonian jungle.

Election commission was expected to issue official vote figures later today.

The official vote figures are expected to be released by the election commission later today. However, the election has been fraught with controversy, with OSCE monitors claiming that unbalanced media coverage strongly favoured Erdogan. The election has been a crucial one for Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003. The country's new constitution, which was introduced following a referendum in 2017, grants the president significant powers, including the ability to dissolve parliament, declare a state of emergency, and appoint senior judges and officials. Throughout the campaign, Erdogan has been accused of using state resources to promote his message, while other candidates have complained of being unfairly treated by the media. The situation has prompted fears of a return to a one-party state, and the erosion of democracy in Turkey. The OSCE monitoring mission has expressed concern about the level of media coverage in Turkey in the run-up to the election, stating that \\"the playing field was unlevel due to the unbalanced media coverage, limitations on freedom of expression and assembly, and lack of equal opportunities.\\" They went on to say that \\"these elections are taking place in a context of a deeply polarised society, and the incumbent president and his party enjoy a notable advantage, given their domination of the media and a machine of political patronage.\\" The election results are likely to be accepted by Erdogan's supporters in Turkey, who have been impressed by his economic policies and his stance on issues such as religion and nationalism. However, opponents are likely to raise concerns about the fairness of the election, and the potential erosion of democratic institutions in Turkey. Many international observers will be watching closely to see how Erdogan uses his new powers in the coming months and years. The country's future relationship with the EU, and its role in the wider Middle East, will also be closely scrutinised in the wake of the election result. In short, while Erdogan's victory may be seen as a positive by some in Turkey, it has raised concerns about the state of democracy in the country, and the wider implications for the region. Ultimately, only time will tell whether this is a turning point for Turkey or the start of a darker chapter in its recent history."},{"instruction":"The beer , however , came to 50 .

This rebirth can be traced to the movement of New Urbanism and postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence.

The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy.

Therefore, Franz Claasen becoming the first \\"free colored\\" landowner happened first. Franz Claasen, a man of mixed European and African descent, was able to purchase land in the Cape area of South Africa and become the first person of color to do so. This was a significant achievement at the time, as people of color were typically not allowed to own land due to colonial laws and policies that favored white landowners. Claasen's success paved the way for other people of color to eventually own land and gain more rights. On the other hand, Denmark is known for being one of the first countries to participate in the African slave trade, starting in the early 17th century. It wasn't until 1792 that Denmark formally ended its participation in the slave trade. While this was a significant step in ending the horrific practice of slavery, it happened long after Franz Claasen's historic achievement. In conclusion, Franz Claasen becoming the first \\"free colored\\" landowner happened before Denmark ended its participation in the African slave trade. Both events are important in their own right, but it's worth noting the impact that Claasen's achievement had on the fight for racial equality and land ownership rights."},{"instruction":"Why I feel so tired after sleeping?

Clean your rear and/or your genitals.","output":"Article: Adjusting Temperature and Jet Strength for a Comfortable Clean When it comes to using a bidet or similar bathroom fixture, the comfort and efficacy of the experience will depend on several factors. One of the most important is setting the appropriate temperature and jet strength for your needs. While bidet systems vary in their features and controls, most will allow you to adjust the water temperature and pressure. For those who prefer a warm wash, you can usually select a temperature range between lukewarm and hot. Similarly, jet strength can be increased or decreased to provide the level of cleaning power you desire, whether you prefer a gentle wash or a more invigorating cleanse. Before you begin, it's also crucial to position yourself properly to ensure an effective and comfortable experience. This usually involves sitting squarely on the bidet or other cleaning fixture, with your back straight and your feet flat on the floor. Some bidets may have additional features such as a seat warmer or air dryer, which can also be adjusted to your desired level of comfort. When using the bidet or similar fixture, it's important to clean your rear and/or your genitals thoroughly. This may involve using toilet paper first to remove any solid waste, followed by using the bidet's water jet to wash the area. If you're cleaning your genital area, it's important to use gentle, circular motions and to avoid using soap or other harsh cleansers. Overall, adjusting the temperature and jet strength of your bidet or other bathroom fixture, as well as positioning yourself properly, can help you achieve optimal comfort and cleanliness during your bathroom routine. With a little experimentation and practice, you can find the settings and techniques that work best for your needs, and enjoy a successful bidet experience every time."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Report warns that more people may fall into negative equity. Council of Mortgage Lenders estimates the number is actually closer to 800,000 people. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A new report has shed light on the increasing number of families who are currently facing negative equity in the UK housing market. According to the report, an alarming 630,000 families across the country currently have mortgages that are larger than the value of their homes. Experts warn that the ongoing economic uncertainty and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to even more people falling into negative equity in the coming months, which would cause significant financial difficulties for affected households. The Council of Mortgage Lenders estimates that the number of people facing negative equity is actually closer to 800,000, which highlights the severity of the situation. Negative equity occurs when a homeowner owes more on their mortgage than their property is currently worth, which can make it difficult to sell or remortgage the property. One of the main reasons for the increase in negative equity is the drop in property values, which has been exacerbated by the current economic climate. The report suggests that homeowners in areas that have seen the largest decline in property value, such as the North East and the West Midlands, are at the highest risk of negative equity. The report also highlights the impact of negative equity on homeowners, who may struggle to keep up with mortgage payments and could be at risk of losing their homes. This could also have wider implications for the broader economy, as foreclosures and repossessions can have a ripple effect on the property market and wider financial system. Experts are advising homeowners who are struggling with negative equity to seek advice and support as soon as possible. This may include negotiating with lenders to refinance or modify their mortgages, or seeking independent financial advice. Overall, the report paints a worrying picture of the current state of the UK housing market, with many families at risk of falling into negative equity due to ongoing economic uncertainty. It is crucial that policymakers and industry leaders work together to address this issue and support those who are affected."},{"instruction":"So I just called my landlady , my anxiety was unjustifiably through the roof .

These measures, which include new powers for the government and increased competition among lawyers, are part of an ongoing effort to achieve savings as quickly as possible. According to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, the need to reduce the legal aid bill is becoming increasingly urgent. Grayling has been vocal in his support for cutting costs in the justice system, and has suggested that legal aid represents an area where savings can be made without compromising the quality of legal services. Among the measures that have been proposed is the introduction of new powers that will allow the government to set limits on the amounts that lawyers can charge for certain types of legal aid work. This is intended to prevent lawyers from overbilling the government for their services, and to ensure that legal aid is being used in a cost-effective manner. In addition to these new powers, the government is also encouraging lawyers to compete on price for legal aid work. By creating a more competitive market for legal aid services, the government hopes to encourage lawyers to offer their services at lower prices, which should help to reduce the overall cost of legal aid. Overall, these measures represent an important step forward in the government's efforts to reduce the legal aid bill. While there are concerns that these changes may negatively impact the quality of legal services in the UK, the government has expressed confidence that the measures will ultimately lead to a more efficient and cost-effective justice system."},{"instruction":"Superheated water Superheated water is liquid water under pressure at temperatures between the usual boiling point, 100 °C (212 °F) and the critical temperature, 374 °C (705 °F).

While many species of whales were targeted, the most commonly hunted were humpback and sperm whales. Despite widespread international condemnation of whaling in general during this period, Japan continued to pursue the practice until the 1980s when there was a global trend towards a moratorium on commercial whaling. These days, Japan only engages in whaling as part of scientific research programs, but there remains plenty of controversy around the practice, with many conservationists and environmentalists arguing that it should be banned completely."},{"instruction":"Tweet: @SpecOpsX Just showed Dad the Hammer video, he said &quot;Was Bub in that&quot; Dad is f hilarious Predict the sentiment of this tweet.

In order to radiate 100 W of power, one would need to use a transmitter capable of supplying 125 W to the antenna. Note that antenna efficiency is a separate issue from impedance matching, which may also reduce the amount of power radiated using a given transmitter. If an SWR meter reads 150 W of incident power and 50 W of reflected power, that means that 100 W have actually been absorbed by the antenna (ignoring transmission line losses). How much of that power has actually been radiated cannot be directly determined through electrical measurements at (or before) the antenna terminals, but would require (for instance) careful measurement of field strength.

Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows.

Tap on the bottom of the mold. Tug the wick lightly.","output":"Article: Candle-making can be a rewarding hobby that allows you to create beautiful and fragrant decorations for your home. Once you have poured your melted wax into a mold and placed a wick in it, the waiting game begins. It is crucial to wait until the mold is completely cooled before attempting to remove the candle. This can take several hours or even overnight. Rushing this step can result in a ruined candle or even a painful burn. When you are confident that the mold is cool, it's essential to release the candle from its mold without causing any damage. One simple technique is to tap on the bottom of the mold to loosen the candle. You can use a wooden spoon or any blunt object to gently tap all around the mold. This should loosen the hardened wax and make it easier to slide out. Once the candle is loose, you can check if it has adhered well to the wick. A common problem is that the wick may not have been secured tightly enough, causing it to become loose or even fall out. To prevent this, tug on the wick gently to make sure it is securely attached to the candle. You can trim excess wick after verifying its stability. In conclusion, making candles can be a fun and creative hobby, but it requires patience and attention to detail. Always wait for the mold to cool completely, use tapping to loosen the candle, and tug lightly on the wick to ensure it is attached firmly. With these tips in mind, you can master the art of candle-making and produce beautiful candles to enjoy in your home or to gift to loved ones."},{"instruction":"First question: What is the best part of your house and why?

However, this can be an expensive and daunting process. To make things easier and more affordable, consider the following tips: Buy Used Supplies: One way to save money when building a darkroom is to purchase used equipment. Check online listings or local second-hand shops for affordable options. It's also a good idea to reach out to other photographers and see if they have any extras they're looking to sell. Choose Your Enlarger Carefully: The enlarger is a crucial piece of equipment in the darkroom. Before purchasing, ensure that the enlarger is in good condition and can accommodate the size of negatives you plan to print from. Consider options with adjustable features to allow for more creative control during the printing process. Acquire Your Printing Kit: Invest in a printing kit containing essential items, such as tongs, trays, and a timer, to make the printing process more efficient. It may also be helpful to purchase a grain-focusing magnifier to aid in the focusing of the enlarger. Acquire and Arrange Your Chemicals: To develop and print your images, you'll need to acquire chemicals, including developer, stop bath, and fixer. Arrange the chemicals in a safe and organized manner, labeling each one to avoid mix-ups. Be sure to follow proper safety precautions when handling chemicals. Get a Safelight: A safelight is used to illuminate the darkroom while printing without affecting the light-sensitive paper. Invest in a high-quality safelight to ensure accurate color reproduction and avoid costly mistakes. Set Up Your Equipment in the Wet Side of the Darkroom: The wet side of the darkroom is where film is developed and prints are made. This side should be dimly lit and free of dust and debris to avoid contamination. Set up your enlarger, trays, and chemicals in this area. Equip the Dry Side of Your Darkroom: The dry side of the darkroom is where prints are hung to dry. Ensure this area is well-ventilated and free of dust and debris. Invest in hangers and clips to create a drying system that works best for your space. Get the Necessary Safety Equipment: Chemicals can be hazardous to your health, so it's important to invest in the proper safety equipment, such as gloves, goggles, and a respirator. Follow all safety guidelines and precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable darkroom experience. Setting up a darkroom at home can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience.
