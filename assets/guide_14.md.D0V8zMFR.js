Locals are trying to save the Sir Alf Ramsey pub in Tunbridge Wells.","output":"The English Football Association (FA) has long prided itself on its moral integrity and upstanding behavior. However, recent events surrounding their attempts to host the 2018 World Cup have tarnished this once-sterling reputation. The FA has now found themselves in the dock, facing accusations of impropriety and disingenuousness in their bid to land the World Cup. In particular, their attempts to curry favor with controversial FIFA figure Jack Warner have raised eyebrows both at home and abroad. At best, the FA's behavior can be described as foolish and naive. At worst, it reeks of something more insidious. Regardless of their intentions, the damage has been done, and the FA's claim to moral high ground has been irreparably damaged. In the midst of this scandal, some grassroots efforts have arisen to try and preserve local traditions. One such example is the campaign to save the Sir Alf Ramsey pub in Tunbridge Wells. Named after the legendary England football manager, the pub has become a well-loved local institution. However, it is now under threat, as developers look to turn it into flats. The campaign to save the pub is perhaps a glimmer of hope in an otherwise grim situation. It represents a rallying cry for those who value tradition, community, and local identity. In the face of the FA's moral failings, it serves as a reminder that there are still things worth fighting for. Overall, the FA's fall from grace is a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and complacency. It's a reminder that no one - not even the most powerful institutions - is immune to scandal and corruption. The challenge now is for the FA to rebuild its reputation and regain the trust of its fans and supporters."},{"instruction":"Question: How many kindergarten classes were there?

However, preparing them can be tricky if you are not accustomed to frying. To start, heat some oil or lard in a frying pan. It's important to use a pan with high edges to prevent oil splattering. Allow the oil or lard to heat up until it reaches a temperature of 375°F. You can use a thermometer to ensure it has reached the correct temperature. Before adding the pork skins to the frying pan, it's worth testing the heat of the oil or lard. You can do this by dropping a small piece of pork rind into the oil or lard. If it starts to sizzle immediately, the oil or lard is ready. Once the oil or lard is at the right temperature, you can add the pork skins to the frying pan. Fry them until they become golden and puffy. This should take around 3-5 minutes. It's important to monitor them closely as they can burn quickly. Once the pork rinds are ready, remove them from the frying pan and allow them to cool for a few minutes. Once they are cool, season them with your choice of spices such as salt, paprika or pepper. You can also try different spice combinations to create your own unique flavor. As for storing leftover pork rinds, place them in an airtight container or a ziplock bag. They can last for several days at room temperature but will stay fresher longer if kept in the refrigerator. In conclusion, frying pork rinds may seem daunting at first, but it's a simple process that can lead to a delicious snack. Remember to test the oil or lard before adding the pork skins, fry until golden and puffy, season with your favorite spices and store leftovers properly.

Speaking at a social mobility conference in London, Dr Cable argued that many jobs only required the skills and knowledge that could be taught on the job or through vocational training, rather than a university degree. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is encouraging professions to re-evaluate the qualifications required for certain jobs in order to promote social mobility and make the job market more accessible. By lowering the barrier to entry for these jobs, individuals from diverse backgrounds and without higher education qualifications would have a better chance to progress their careers. Dr Cable's comments have been seen as a response to growing concerns about the UK's social mobility stagnation, with the job market increasingly demanding highly qualified candidates for even more basic positions. By making a concerted effort to reassess the types of qualifications necessary for many jobs, the government hopes to provide more opportunities for those with alternate skill sets or those who did not pursue higher education. However, Dr Cable also acknowledged that some professions would still require a degree, such as those in medicine, engineering, or law. Nevertheless, this shift in attitude towards degree requirements will likely be welcomed by many who have been discouraged from pursuing certain career paths due to the high cost of higher education or who have lacked the means to acquire a degree. In the long term, it is hoped that this change will help to increase social mobility and create a more diverse and accessible job market for individuals from all walks of life. Businesses and professions will need to be willing to adapt their hiring practices in order to realize these benefits, but the potential rewards for creating a more equitable job market are significant."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: duck, flock, food","output":"The flock of ducks eagerly gathered around the food."},{"instruction":"Q: Who runs Guam's main health care facility?

However, some possible insights can be gleaned from historical records and scholarship. In general, exiles were individuals who had been banished from their home countries or regions due to political, religious, or other reasons. In some cases, they may have been forced to work in labor camps or other types of penal institutions. Guards and overseers, on the other hand, were typically employed by the authorities to manage and maintain order in such institutions. One key factor that may affect the ratio of exiles to guards and overseers is the nature of the labor being performed. For example, if the labor is highly skilled or specialized, there may be fewer workers overall but a higher ratio of overseers to workers. Conversely, if the labor is more manual and repetitive, there may be a larger number of workers and fewer overseers. Another factor that could impact the ratio of exiles to guards and overseers is the political climate of the time period in question. In some historical contexts, ruling authorities may have sought to maintain strict control over the population and therefore employed a larger number of guards and overseers relative to the number of exiles. In other cases, however, dissent and rebellion may have been more prevalent, leading to a higher number of exiles and a larger need for guards and overseers to maintain order. Overall, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about whether there were fewer workers among exiles or guards and overseers, as the specifics of each context could vary widely. Perhaps a more fruitful line of inquiry would be to examine the experiences and conditions of these workers more closely, in order to better understand the ways in which power, oppression, and resistance operate within systems of institutionalized labor."},{"instruction":"w does this story end?

This time, he has taken aim at former President Barack Obama, calling him a 'sore winner.' According to the former politician, Obama's failure to embrace bipartisanship is the root cause of the current political discord in the United States. The idea of bipartisanship is not new. It is the concept of working together across party lines to achieve common goals. It is an ideal that politicians from both sides of the aisle have pledged to uphold for decades. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to achieve. Many blame the current level of polarization on former President Obama. According to his critics, he was unwilling to work with Republicans, instead preferring to push through his agenda by executive order. This, they argue, set the stage for the current atmosphere of mistrust and division. Coming from an experienced politician, these comments are significant. It suggests that even those within the Democratic Party are beginning to challenge the administration's approach to governance. It also highlights the growing rift between the two factions of the party. Senator's comments on gun-control laws are equally controversial. He believes that the government should not pass laws that infringe on the Second Amendment rights of Americans. This is a position that is bound to be unpopular with many progressive voters. Overall, the comments made by the former Senator and Presidential hopeful are sure to spark debate. They bring to light some of the challenges facing the United States as it tries to move forward. While opinions may be sharply divided on these issues, it is clear that something needs to change if the government is to be more effective in meeting the needs of its citizens."},{"instruction":"Solve 0 = 3295849*o 3295812*o 3145 for o.","output":"0=3295849o-3295812o-3145 can be simplified as 37o = 3145.

They can be carriers of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus. Eliminating or reducing the mosquito population in your yard is essential for your family's health and enjoyment of outdoor activities. Here are some tips and tricks to make your yard a mosquito-free zone. 1. Eliminate or Fill Nooks, Crannies, and Holes: Mosquitoes can breed in small pockets of stagnant water. Fill in any holes in your yard or cover them up to eliminate potential breeding sites. 2. Mow Your Lawns Weekly: Keeping your lawn mowed and short can help reduce the number of mosquitoes in your yard. Mosquitoes prefer longer grass as it provides them shelter. 3. Trim Back Tall Weeds and Bushes: Mosquitoes prefer to rest in the shade and higher areas. Be sure to trim back any tall weeds or bushes to make your yard less hospitable for mosquitoes. 4. Plant Mosquito-Repelling Flowers and Herbs: Some plants are known to naturally repel mosquitoes. Consider planting lavender, marigolds, or citronella in your yard. 5. Get Some Fish for Your Water Garden: Certain fish, such as mosquitofish, feed on mosquito larvae. Adding these fish to your water garden can help reduce the mosquito population. 6. Add a Waterfall, Fountain, or Aerator to Your Water Garden: Mosquitoes prefer still water for breeding. Installing a fountain or aerator in your water garden can help keep the water moving, making it less attractive to mosquitoes. 7. Make Use of Larvicides: Larvicides, a type of pesticide that targets mosquito larvae can be used in areas where water cannot be eliminated or altered. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully and avoid using it in areas with fish or other aquatic life. 8. Encourage Other Mosquito Predators to Visit Your Yard: Bats, birds, and dragonflies are natural mosquito predators. Encouraging them to visit your yard can help reduce the mosquito population. In conclusion, these eight tips and tricks can help you eliminate or reduce mosquitoes in your yard. Mosquitoes can be a significant threat to your family's health and can ruin your outdoor experiences.

On Friday, the Coast Guard cautioned boaters against the lower Lake Michigan temperatures.","output":"Michigan Residents Should Prepare for a Colder Winter Due to Lower Great Lakes Temperatures Winter may arrive earlier than usual for Michigan residents this year. This can be attributed to the lower surface temperatures of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, both of which have seen a drop of 6.1 degrees in their average temperature last week. As a result, Michigan residents may want to start bundling up sooner to prepare for the chilly weather which may linger throughout November and December. The cooler temperatures also mean that the lakes may ice up sooner than expected. This may be problematic to boaters, as the Coast Guard advised on Friday of the lower temperatures especially in Lake Michigan. Michigan residents who are used to milder winters may want to take extra precaution and prepare for the colder climate in the upcoming months. It's important to make sure homes are properly insulated, and have sufficient heating systems installed to keep the indoors warm and cozy during the low temperatures. Overall, Michigan residents should take note of the drop in lake temperature as a warning sign to prepare for the winter ahead."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise yeah yeah hm i i think um you know we're able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too so i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose, can we conclude the hypothesis I think we know each other well. is true?

Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intelbased servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for 332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system inhouse; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodityproducer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.","output":"Title: Dell's Expansion into Enterprise Servers and Acquisition Challenges"},{"instruction":"Sara: gimme once again Andrea's number, pls Josh: v card sent.

Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide but over the years adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. The US was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few US cities retained DST locally thereafter, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a deception. Reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.

The Japanese victory occurred a mere three decades after the Meiji Restoration set a feudal Japan on course to emulate the Western nations in their economic and technological achievements. Finally, in December 1894, the Qing government took concrete steps to reform military institutions and to retrain selected units in westernized drills, tactics and weaponry.

Webber's rendition will undoubtedly add a new layer of excitement to this well-loved story. However, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" isn't the only project on Webber's mind. In fact, his long-running musical \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" just celebrated its 25th anniversary this year. This remarkable achievement is a testament to the enduring appeal of Webber's music and his ability to create shows that capture the hearts of viewers across generations. Interestingly, one of Webber's most famous songs from the musical \\"Jesus Christ Superstar,\\" \\"I Don't Know How to Love Him,\\" wasn't originally named as such.

If you're looking for inspiration to create your own shape poem, analyzing examples can be a great starting point. Take the time to read and study different shape poems, paying attention to how words are arranged and how they interact with the shape of the image. Once you've spent some time with examples, it's time to focus on your own interests. Whether it's a hobby, an activity, or something that brings you joy, start exploring how you can express these ideas through a shape poem. Maybe you enjoy painting and want to create a poem in the shape of a paintbrush, or perhaps you're a runner and want to create a poem in the shape of a running shoe. Nature can be an excellent source of inspiration, too. Take a walk outside and observe the shapes of the natural world. From the curve of a tree branch to the shape of a bird in flight, there are countless ways that nature can inspire you to create a unique and meaningful shape poem. Finally, consider using an object of sentimental value as the basis for your poem. Maybe it's a cherished piece of jewelry, a nostalgic toy from your childhood, or a memento from a special trip. Use the shape of the object to guide your poem, allowing the words to flow and inspire the final shape of the image. With a little bit of inspiration and creative energy, you can create your own shape poem that reflects your unique style and interests.

These chemical herbicides work by inhibiting the growth of the plant, eventually leading to its death. While some people have concerns about the safety and environmental impact of glyphosate, it remains a popular and effective option for weed control. One way to maximize the effectiveness of these products is by applying them several times over the course of a growing season. This can help to ensure that even weeds that have already begun to grow are eliminated before they have a chance to seed and spread. Additionally, repeated applications can help to target different stages of growth, ensuring that the herbicide is effective against both young and mature plants. While chemical herbicides are effective, they are not the only option for controlling weeds. Organic weed-control methods can also be used in conjunction with glyphosate and similar products. One approach is to use mechanical methods, such as hand weeding or hoeing, to remove weeds manually. Another option is to use organic herbicides, made from natural ingredients like vinegar or citric acid. By combining chemical and organic weed control methods, property owners can achieve the best of both worlds. Glyphosate and similar products can help to effectively eliminate unwanted plant growth, while organic methods can help to minimize the use of potentially harmful chemicals. When used correctly and in combination, these methods can help to keep gardens and agricultural fields healthy and free of weeds."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: bathroom, contain, toilet, wall","output":"The bathroom wall contains the toilet."},{"instruction":"midation and violence against women continues \`\` unabated '' in posttaliban afghanistan , but they have greater access to education and employment , a u.n. report says .

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A fascinating experiment conducted by New York psychologist Arthur Aron in 1997 has recently gone viral, after a New York Times columnist tried it out and confirmed its effectiveness. In the experiment, Aron made strangers fall in love by asking them a series of 36 questions. The questions are designed to progressively become more intense and personal, encouraging the participants to open up to one another and develop a deeper connection. The questions start off innocuously enough, asking things like \\"What would constitute a perfect day for you?\\" and \\"Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?\\". However, they gradually become more probing, asking things like \\"When did you last cry in front of another person?\\" and \\"Is there something that you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?\\". The idea behind the experiment is that by answering these questions honestly and vulnerably, the participants will start to feel a sense of intimacy and closeness with each other that could potentially lead to romantic feelings. While the experiment was originally conducted in a lab setting, the New York Times columnist who recently tried it out did so on a date with a virtual stranger, and reported that they felt a strong connection afterwards. So, if you're looking to fall in love yourself, why not give the 36 questions a try? While there are no guarantees that they'll work for everyone, they certainly seem to have a good track record so far. And even if they don't lead to love, they're still a great way to get to know someone on a deeper level and have some thought-provoking conversations.

With this information, the calculation is relatively straightforward. Assuming the total population of the city is known, the first step is to determine the number of individuals who are 65 years of age or older. This can be achieved by accessing census data or other demographic information that provides a breakdown of age cohorts within the population. Once the number of individuals who are 65 years of age or older is known, the next step is to subtract this number from the total population of the city. The resulting figure represents the number of individuals who are younger than 65 years of age. To calculate the percentage of individuals who are not 65 years of age or older, the number of individuals who are younger than 65 years of age should be divided by the total population of the city. This value should then be multiplied by 100 to convert the figure to a percentage. For example, if a city has a total population of 100,000 and 20,000 of those individuals are 65 years of age or older, the calculation to determine the percentage of individuals who are not 65 years of age or older is as follows: 100,000 - 20,000 = 80,000 80,000 ÷ 100,000 = 0.8 0.8 x 100 = 80% Therefore, in this example, 80% of the city's population is not 65 years of age or older.

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A skijump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a skijump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.

Some camera designs provide at least some EI choices by adjusting the sensor's signal gain in the digital realm.

The motivational clip shows Depay working out and training hard, and it's clear that he is fully committed to reaching his full potential. Depay has also caught the eye of Holland manager Guus Hiddink, who has praised his ability and potential. Hiddink believes that Depay could become Holland's best player in the near future, which is high praise indeed considering the country's rich footballing history. It remains to be seen which club will ultimately secure Depay's services, but one thing is certain: the young winger has the talent and drive to become a star at the highest level, and it will be exciting to see where his career takes him in the coming years."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? when did ju ju on that beat come out?","output":"The song \\"Juju on That Beat\\" was released on September 30, 2016."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

Bartomeu believes Pep Guardiola will one day return to the club. He says Luis Suarez does not have a no biting clause.","output":"Barcelona President Admits Difficult Year Barcelona's recent history has been plagued with controversy, and it seems that the club's current president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, is well aware of the difficulties his tenure has brought. Speaking in a recent interview, Bartomeu acknowledged that the past year has been \\"very difficult\\" for the club, and that he has faced some significant challenges in his role. One of the most significant issues Bartomeu has faced is the ongoing fallout from allegations of corruption and wrongdoing at the club. In recent years, Barcelona has been accused of various misdemeanours, including the manipulation of player contracts, tax fraud, and illegal activity in the transfer market. While the club has vehemently denied all of these allegations, they have still had a significant impact on the reputation of both the team and its management. Despite these difficulties, Bartomeu remains optimistic about the future of the club. In particular, he believes that former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola will one day return to the team. Guardiola is widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches of all time, and he has previously led Barcelona to unprecedented success during his four-year reign at the club. Bartomeu believes that Guardiola's return is a matter of when, not if. Perhaps surprisingly, Bartomeu also made headlines recently when he revealed that Barcelona striker Luis Suarez does not have a \\"no biting\\" clause in his contract. This revelation comes after Suarez was involved in a number of high-profile biting incidents in recent years, including the infamous 2014 World Cup incident where he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. While this news may come as a surprise to some, it is just one of many challenges that Bartomeu and his team have had to face during their tenure at Barcelona. Despite the difficulties they have faced, however, the president remains committed to the future success of the club, and he has vowed to do everything in his power to ensure that the team continues to be one of the best in the world."},{"instruction":"Would the answer to the question What terrorist group was headed by Donald DeFreeze ? be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?

These laws helped establish the Church of England and cemented the power of the monarchy in English politics. The first of the Six Statutes, the Act of Supremacy, was passed in 1534. This law declared that the king was the supreme head of the Church of England, replacing the authority of the pope. The Act of Supremacy was followed by the Act of Succession, which established the order of succession to the English throne, and the Treasons Act, which made it a crime to deny the king's authority. In 1536, the government passed the Act of Use of Welsh Language, which banned the use of Welsh in legal proceedings and official documents. This law was aimed at assimilating Wales into English culture and language. The remaining two statutes, the Act for the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries and the Act for the Dissolution of the Greater Monasteries, were both passed in 1539. These laws dissolved religious orders and confiscated their property, which helped fill the royal coffers and break the power of the Catholic Church in England. In total, the Six Statutes were passed over a period of five years, from 1534 to 1539. This was a time of great political and religious upheaval in England, as the Tudor dynasty sought to establish its authority and break the power of the Catholic Church. The Six Statutes were a key part of this process, and their legacy can still be seen in the modern-day Church of England and the power of the monarchy in British politics."},{"instruction":"Keywords: change, life, nothing What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","output":"Nothing will change in your life if you don't take action."},{"instruction":"What is the solution?

One reason was the tension between the tribes and the white settlers in the area, which led to conflicts over land and resources. Another reason was the perceived threat that the tribes posed to American expansionism and Manifest Destiny. Carson was a prominent figure in the American West during the mid-19th century, serving as a guide for American expeditions and military campaigns. He was also an Indian agent, responsible for negotiating treaties and managing relations between Native American tribes and the US government. In the case of the Navajo and Mescalero Apache, Carson saw their way of life as a hindrance to American progress. He believed that their hunting practices were destructive to the environment and that their nomadic lifestyles prevented them from developing agricultural and industrial skills necessary for modern society. Furthermore, the Navajo and Mescalero Apache were seen as a threat to American interests in the region. Both tribes had engaged in raiding and warfare with white settlers and neighboring Native American tribes, leading to tensions and conflicts. Carson was tasked with subduing the tribes and forcing them onto reservations, which would allow for easier control and exploitation of the land and resources in the area. Carson's campaign against the Navajo and Mescalero Apache was marked by brutality, including the forced relocation of thousands of people, destruction of homes and crops, and the killing of many Navajo prisoners of war. The campaign culminated in the infamous Long Walk of the Navajo, where thousands of Navajo were marched hundreds of miles to a reservation in New Mexico. Overall, Carson's campaign against the Navajo and Mescalero Apache was driven by a combination of white settler interests, American expansionism, and perceived threats to American security. Though his actions were controversial and undeniably harmful to Native American communities, they were in line with the dominant attitudes and policies of his time."},{"instruction":"ere is a dialogue: Mary: Have you arrived?

Get everything out in the open. Forgive Agree to leave the past in the past.","output":"Trust is one of the most significant elements in any relationship. It takes years to build trust, but a single action can destroy it in seconds. Trust-breaking behaviors can lead to the end of any healthy relationship, whether it’s between friends, family, or romantic partners. Therefore, it is essential to stop the mistrustful behaviors immediately. To build trust, transparency is key. Get everything out in the open. If you have violated someone’s trust, it’s important to be honest about it. Don't hide it or defend it. Acknowledge the mistake and show genuine remorse. Be open to clarifying any doubts or questions your loved one may have. It may be challenging to be vulnerable, but it's the only way to rebuild trust. Forgiveness is essential in any relationship, and it's especially important when trying to rebuild trust. Forgive, but don't forget. Forgiveness doesn't mean erasing the past or justifying the behavior that broke the trust. It means accepting the apology, understanding that the person is remorseful and trying to move forward. In some cases, it may be necessary to seek outside help, such as counseling, to work through the damage done and come to a point of forgiveness. It's also important to agree to leave the past in the past. Once you've worked through the issue and forgiven each other, it's crucial to move forward without bringing up the past. You cannot build trust if you continually bring up past events. Trust requires leaving the past behind and looking towards the future. It may take time to regain the trust that was lost, but it's possible with effort and work. In conclusion, trust is an essential aspect of every relationship. When trust is broken, it can be challenging to rebuild, but it's not impossible. Stop trust-breaking behaviors immediately, be transparent, seek forgiveness, and agree to leave the past in the past. This allows space for a healthy and renewed relationship based on honesty, care, and trust."},{"instruction":"What is the title of this article: Engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science.

For a restaurant look, slice the entire wrap in half on a diagonal. Finished.","output":"When it comes to serving wraps, presentation is key to making a dish look both appetizing and professional. One way to achieve this is by visually dividing the wrap into three strips. This doesn't have to be a physical cut, but rather a mental separation that helps guide the eye and adds interest to the plate. To visually divide the wrap, start by locating the center of the wrap. From there, imagine two lines running parallel to the center, one on each side. These lines create three equal strips that can be distinguished by the way the ingredients are arranged. For those looking to take things to the next level, slicing the entire wrap in half on a diagonal can create a restaurant-worthy presentation. The diagonal cut adds an angular element to the plate, making the dish feel more dynamic than a straight cut would. This method can also help show off the ingredients inside the wrap, making it look more exciting and enticing. Of course, not all wraps are created equal, and some may not lend themselves well to a diagonal cut. In these cases, sticking with the visual division of three strips is a safe bet that will still elevate the presentation of the dish. In conclusion, visually dividing a wrap can be an easy and effective way to make a dish look more professional and appetizing. Whether you choose to do a mental divide or go all in with a diagonal cut, this simple trick is sure to impress your guests and take your wrap game to the next level."},{"instruction":"4 and he brought in the priests and the levites, and gathered them together into the east street, Make this proper case","output":"4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the East Street."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: The use of social media has increased dramatically in the last few years, with millions of people now regularly posting and sharing content online.

The discovery is a significant moment in history, and supporters of Richard III are hopeful that it will lead to a rewriting of his story in the history books. For years, Richard III has been portrayed as a villainous and power-hungry king, with many believing that he was responsible for the deaths of his two young nephews, the Princes in the Tower. However, the discovery of his remains has shed new light on Richard III's character and reputation. It has been revealed that the King suffered from scoliosis, a medical condition that caused his spine to curve, which may have affected his appearance and behavior. This new information challenges the long-held belief that Richard III was a ruthless and cunning ruler. The discovery of Richard III's remains is a testament to the advances of modern science and technology.

This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised? Your small intestine, and not your stomach, does most of the work! Based on the paragraph, does the response Gut correctly answer the question Where do foods move into from stomach??

The incident took place when Zavjalos, who had consumed an extremely large quantity of alcohol, ran towards Brian Gallagher and attacked him. Although Zavjalos claims to have only a vague recollection of the incident, he has pleaded guilty to the charge of assault by beating. The court has sentenced Zavjalos to a four-month custodial sentence, which has been suspended for 12 months with a specified activity requirement. Moreover, he will have to undertake 250 hours of unpaid work and pay £600 compensation to the victim.

The Tidewater in eastern North Carolina was settled chiefly by immigrants from rural England and the Scottish Highlands. The upcountry of western North Carolina was settled chiefly by ScotsIrish, English, and German Protestants, the socalled cohee.

During the American Revolutionary War, the English and Highland Scots of eastern North Carolina tended to remain loyal to the British Crown, because of longstanding business and personal connections with Great Britain. The English, Welsh, ScotsIrish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain.

Most important was the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life, which sought to confine religion to a private sphere. Further, the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools, which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however, antiCatholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants, and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position. As a consequence, strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths, even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics.[citation needed] What position do Jeffries and Ryan argue was the reason for support from a coalition of separationists?

Be polite when you address other people. Maintain perfect posture. Respect your elders. Be sweet and friendly to everybody. Receive compliments with grace. Avoid excessive drink. Be a gracious guest. Offer your help to friends and neighbors during tough times.","output":"Good table manners, politeness, perfect posture, respect for elders, friendliness and grace are some of the traits that characterize a well-mannered person. These characteristics reflect not only upon individuals, but upon society as a whole. By adhering to these social norms, we can demonstrate respect for others and build positive relationships. One of the most conspicuous ways to display good manners is at the dining table. A well-mannered person is conscious of their eating habits and uses utensils properly. They do not talk with their mouths full and wait for others to be served before they eat. Being polite and respectful towards others is another distinguishing trait of a well-mannered individual. This means addressing others appropriately, saying \\"thank you\\" and \\"please\\" when needed, and showing gratitude for acts of kindness. Another key aspect of good manners is maintaining excellent posture. This indicates respect for oneself and others by demonstrating confidence and poise. Indeed, it is vital to show reverence for older people by deferring to their wishes and needs, especially in cultures where elders are held in high esteem. A well-mannered person is someone who is sweet and friendly to everybody, regardless of their status or background. They show genuine interest in others' well-being by offering compliments, listening attentively, and helping them out when needed. When complimented, a gracious person accepts the compliment with humility and expresses gratitude. They do not boast or show off, and instead use the compliment as a means of encouragement to do better. It is also essential to avoid excessive drinking, as it can cloud one's judgment, making it difficult to adhere to social norms. It is not polite to cause a disturbance or embarrass oneself in front of others. Being a gracious guest is equally imperative. One should always show appreciation for the host's hospitality, keep the place tidy, and comport oneself appropriately. Finally, offering help to friends and neighbors during tough times is a demonstration of character and shows concern for others' welfare. By empathizing and supporting others in challenging times, a well-mannered person can build stronger bonds with those around them and foster a culture of kindness, respect, and positivity."},{"instruction":"1.

To answer the question more specifically, it would be necessary to identify the game or games in question.

This means that touchdowns can be scored from a variety of yard lines, depending on the circumstances of the play. In American football, the field is divided into ten-yard segments, with the goal lines located at each end of the field. When a team advances the ball across the opposing team's goal line, they score a touchdown worth six points. Typically, teams score touchdowns from within their opponent's half of the field, and often within a few yards of the goal line. However, long touchdown runs or passes can result in scores from farther away, sometimes as far as midfield or beyond.

Carl Levin, D-Michigan, who currently chairs the Armed Services Committee, has strongly criticized private contractors working for Blackwater.

Levin's statements in the text delved into the ramifications of these incidents, which reportedly involved contractors working for Blackwater. He emphasized the key role that contractors play in shaping the way in which the US military is viewed by the people of Afghanistan. The first incident took place in 2007, when guards from Blackwater opened fire on civilians in Baghdad, leaving at least 17 dead. The second incident occurred in 2009, when contractors working for the same company, then called XE Services, shot and killed at least two Afghan civilians. Levin refuted the argument that these incidents were isolated, stating that they demonstrated a systematic issue of inadequate control over weapons and of loose rules of engagement. He suggested that the licenses issued by the Afghan government for the private security contractors made them even less accountable for their actions, as compared to the US military. Levin's comments pointed towards the need to ensure accountability for private contractors, which would not only ensure safety for Afghan civilians but also improve their perception of the US military.

The answer is that his second touchdown traveled an additional 44 yards compared to his first. During the Green Bay Packers' game against the Chicago Bears in September 2015, Rodgers threw two touchdowns in the first half. The first touchdown was caught by receiver James Jones and went for 13 yards. The second touchdown was caught by receiver Ty Montgomery and traveled 60 yards. The stark difference between the two touchdowns caught the attention of viewers and commentators alike. It was a showcase of Rodgers' impressive arm strength and accuracy, as well as his ability to lead his team to victory. Rodgers' second touchdown pass of 60 yards was undoubtedly a highlight of the game, but it's important to note that both touchdowns contributed to the Packers' eventual win. Each successful play in football is crucial in securing a victory, and both Rodgers' short and long touchdown passes were essential in accomplishing just that. In conclusion, Aaron Rodgers' second touchdown pass in the Packers-Bears game was 44 yards longer than his first touchdown pass. But regardless of length, each touchdown was instrumental in helping his team secure a win."},{"instruction":"Johnson Controls Sees Revenue, Earns Up CHICAGO (Reuters) Auto parts supplier Johnson Controls Inc. &lt;A HREF=http://www.investor.reuters.com/FullQuote.aspx?ticker=JCI.N target=/stocks/quickinfo/fullquote&gt;JCI.N&lt;/A&gt; said on Friday it expects higher sales and earnings in fiscal 2005, driven by strength in both its automotive group and controls business.

Contour the eye using eyeliner. Fill in the eyelids with eyeshadow. Apply jet black, ultralash mascara. Darken the eyebrows with eyebrow pencil.","output":"Looking to add some definition and glamour to your makeup routine? Here are some simple tips to help you bronze up your face and neck, contour your eyes and darken your brows. First, grab your trusty bronzer and apply it to your face and neck using a large makeup brush. Be sure to blend it in well to create a natural, sun-kissed look. Next, it's time to contour your eyes. Using black eyeliner, apply a thin line as close to your lash line as possible. Then, using a small blending brush or cotton swab, smudge the line outward towards the outer corner of your eye. This will create a subtle yet stunning definition to your eyes. Once you've contoured your eyes, it's time to fill in your lids with eyeshadow. Choose a shade that complements your skin tone and the look you're going for. For a more natural look, stick to neutral browns and taupes. For a bold and dramatic look, go for bright blues, greens or pinks. Now it's time to apply some ultra-lash mascara. Choose a jet black formula to really make your eyes pop. Start at the base of your lashes and wiggle the wand back and forth as you move it toward the tips. Repeat this motion on the lower lashes as well. Finally, darken your eyebrows using an eyebrow pencil. Choose a shade that is a close match to your natural hair color and apply it with light strokes, filling in any sparse areas to create a fuller, more defined eyebrow. And there you have it - an easy, five-step makeup routine that will help you bronze up your face and neck, contour your eyes and darken your brows for a stunning, glamorous look."},{"instruction":"Mauro: mom, dad told i cant go out Mauro: but i have to buy notebook Mom: i will buy you this notebook, you have to stay home and read a lecture What was that dialogue about, in two sentences or less?","output":"Mauro can't go out to buy a notebook because his dad forbid him to do so, but his mom decided to buy it for him and asked him to study at home instead."},{"instruction":"Details:Withthefirstclassmaterial,fashionindesignandcomfortableforwear,'MonclerLoireCoatWomenFurHoodieZipWithButtonGreen'arefillingwiththewhitegoosedown,verycomfortableforwearing,itisanicechoiceforpeopleiftheyarelookingfortheworldfashion,theywillleadthemarketfashionthiswinter,youshouldnotmissit,welcometocometoourwebsitetogetthe'MonclerLoireCoatWomen'.andenjoythefeelingtheybringtoyou.

Depending on the game in question, there may be multiple players who threw short touchdown passes. However, one way to determine the shortest touchdown pass of a game is by looking at the distance of the pass from the quarterback to the receiver. In American Football, the average length of a touchdown pass is around 35 yards. However, shorter touchdown passes can be just as effective in moving the ball down the field and scoring points. In fact, many successful teams in the NFL use short, quick passes to keep their offense moving forward. To determine which player threw the shortest touchdown pass of a game, you would need to examine the game's statistics. This would involve looking at the individual passes thrown by each quarterback, the yardage gained by the receiver, and the location of the touchdown. One example of a game where the shortest touchdown pass may have been significant was Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams. In this game, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw a two-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sony Michel. While this was not the shortest touchdown pass of Brady's career, it was a crucial touchdown that gave the Patriots a lead they would never relinquish. Ultimately, the answer to which player threw the shortest touchdown pass of the game will depend on the specific game in question. However, no matter the length of the pass, a touchdown is always a significant accomplishment and can be integral to a team's success."},{"instruction":"Answer based on context: On 11 February 1727 Spain, under command of the Marquis de las Torres and supervision of Chief Engineer of the Spanish Royal Engineer Corps Marquis of Verboom, laid siege to the city .

The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her playhours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash.
