This was a dark time in Soviet history, during which many individuals were arbitrarily arrested and sent to labor camps for purported crimes against the state. Conditions in these camps were harsh, with prisoners being subjected to forced labor, inadequate food and medical care, and frequent abuse. According to historical records, the Gulag system reached its peak size in the early 1950s, with an estimated 2.5 million people imprisoned in labor camps and prisons throughout the Soviet Union. However, beginning in the mid-1950s, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev initiated a series of reforms aimed at reducing the Gulag population and improving conditions for prisoners. Despite these efforts, the Gulag continued to exist in some form until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Today, the memory of those who suffered and died in the Gulag serves as a reminder of the dangers of authoritarianism and the importance of upholding human rights and individual freedoms."},{"instruction":"Avid DNxHR, which stands for Digital Nonlinear Extensible High Resolution, is a lossy UHDTV postproduction codec engineered for multigeneration compositing with reduced storage and bandwidth requirements.

Step 1: Place the Connector Base Over the Wire First, take the wire you wish to connect and slide the connector base over it. Make sure the wire is fully inserted into the base and that there is no exposed wire. Step 2: Loosen the Screw Inside the Connector Next, loosen the screw inside the connector by turning it counterclockwise. This will open the connector’s jaws, allowing you to place the wire between them. Step 3: Touch the Conductor to the Screw and Tighten It Now, take the exposed end of your wire and touch it to the screw in the connector. Hold the conductor firmly against the screw and use a screwdriver to tighten the screw by turning it clockwise. Make sure the screw is tight enough to hold the conductor securely in place. Step 4: Install the Back Housing of the Connector After the wire is connected securely to the screw, you can install the back housing of the connector. Make sure the housing clicks into place and covers the entire connector.

This means that they do not consist of married couples or families living together. Instead, these households may be made up of individuals living alone, roommates, or other types of living arrangements. The percentage of non-family households varies by state and region. For example, in states with large urban centers like New York and California, the percentage of non-family households tends to be higher. In more rural states like Wyoming and Vermont, the percentage of non-family households tends to be lower. There are many factors that contribute to the increase in non-family households, including changes in family structures, increased mobility and migration, and economic factors such as the rising cost of housing. As these trends continue, it is likely that the percentage of non-family households will continue to rise in the United States. It is important to note that non-family households can provide a range of benefits and challenges. For individuals living alone, non-family households can provide a sense of independence and privacy. For roommates, non-family households can provide a more affordable living situation. However, non-family households can also come with challenges such as social isolation and limited support networks. Overall, while non-family households may not be the traditional household structure, they are becoming increasingly common in the United States. As with any type of living situation, there are both benefits and challenges, and it is up to individuals to determine what works best for them."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to when did the life of pablo come out??","output":"The Life of Pablo was released on February 14, 2016."},{"instruction":"had the privilege to see this movie at the Intenational Film Festival of Rotterdam.

Saints sold five players during the summer but would not allow the France international to join Tottenham. Schneiderlin admits he was frustrated but believes the club reacted to angry fans who were fed up of seeing their best players sold. The 24yearold is currently training with France ahead of a friendly against Portugal on October 11.","output":"Southampton's midfield ace Morgan Schneiderlin has recently shared his view on the club's decision to keep him despite selling five other players during the summer transfer window. Schneiderlin, who had been linked with a move to Tottenham, disclosed that he was initially frustrated by the club's stance but eventually understood that the decision was made to appease the fans who were getting tired of seeing their top talents being sold. Schneiderlin, a France international who is currently training with Les Bleus ahead of their friendly against Portugal, admitted that he first struggled to accept the fact that he was not allowed to leave the club. The 24-year-old, who had a sensational season with Southampton in the previous campaign, expressed his desire to take on new challenges and compete in the UEFA Champions League, a competition that Spurs were able to offer. However, after reflecting on the situation, Schneiderlin believes that staying with the Saints was the best decision for him and the club. He believes that the club's decision to keep him was influenced by the supporters who were growing increasingly tired of seeing key players leave every summer. By keeping him at the club, Southampton bosses were making a statement that they were not a selling club and were determined to hold on to their best players. Schneiderlin, who has played a pivotal role in Southampton's impressive start to the new campaign, has undoubtedly emerged as one the promising midfielders in the Premier League. His departure would have been a massive blow for the club and could have derailed their promising start to the new campaign. The club has had a solid start to their Premier League campaign, with impressive wins over West Brom, Burnley, and Norwich, and currently sit fifth in the league table. All in all, it was a wise decision to keep Schneiderlin at Southampton, and it seems that both the player and the club are happy with that decision. With his talent, drive, and commitment to the cause, Saints fans can look forward to seeing Schneiderlin play a key role for the club in the coming months."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Scientology 'minders' supported him after Jett's death in 2009. Jett Travolta suffered from autism and died after a seizure aged 16.","output":"John Travolta, the renowned Hollywood actor, experienced one of the darkest moments of his life when his son Jett passed away in 2009. Jett suffered from autism and tragically died after a seizure at the young age of 16. In the aftermath of this terrible event, Travolta was closely monitored by Scientology 'minders' for a period of two years. The Church of Scientology, of which Travolta is a prominent member, assigns so-called 'minders' to high-profile members who are struggling with personal issues. These 'minders' are responsible for providing emotional support as well as keeping close tabs on the individual's behavior and actions. During the two-year period following Jett's death, Travolta was under continuous supervision by these 'minders'. This meant that they monitored his behavior and actions on a daily basis to ensure that he was coping well with the tragedy. This level of support is not unusual for members of the Church of Scientology, who often rely on their fellow Scientologists for emotional and spiritual guidance. While some might criticize the Church of Scientology's approach to dealing with personal crises, it seems that Travolta found great comfort in the support provided by his 'minders'. Losing a child is one of the most traumatic experiences anyone can go through, and it is understandable that Travolta sought solace in the guidance of his fellow Scientologists. In conclusion, the death of John Travolta's son Jett was a tragedy that will stay with him for the rest of his life. The support provided by Scientology 'minders' in the aftermath of this event was a testament to the strength of the community, but also raises questions about the role of the Church of Scientology in the personal lives of its members."},{"instruction":"Premise: A group of people are laughing, and a baby in an orange shirt is looking on.

The plane, which was then 41,000 feet in the air, plummeted more than 6,200 feet in the span of 30 seconds, the Japan Economic Newswire reports. Amazingly, only the flight attendants were hurt, and only four passengers reported feeling sick. “The centrifugal force may have helped lessen the impact on passengers,” the head of the Transport Safety Board theorized. If you’re wondering how the pilot could make such a critical mistake, Gizmodo has an image of the control panel of a Boeing 737700, which reveals that the cockpit door knob is mere inches from the rudder control.

This is a process where the affected joint is manipulated back into its proper place. While some dislocations might only require minor adjustments, others may require surgery to fully fix the problem. If you suspect you have a dislocation, it's important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Delaying treatment can lead to further damage and a longer recovery period. Your doctor will determine the best course of action for your specific situation, which may include a reduction. During a reduction, your doctor will use manual manipulation techniques to reposition your joint. This may involve applying gentle pressure or pulling on the joint, depending on the severity of the dislocation. In some cases, sedation or anesthesia may be used to help manage pain and reduce muscle tension during the procedure. While a reduction can be uncomfortable, it's usually a relatively quick process. Once the joint is back in place, your doctor will likely provide you with instructions for managing any pain or swelling. You may also be advised to engage in physical therapy or other exercises to help regain strength and mobility in the affected area. If it's determined that your dislocation requires surgery, your doctor will discuss the details of the procedure with you. This may involve repairing or reconstructing damaged tissues, or replacing the joint entirely. Recovery time for surgical dislocations can vary depending on the extent of the damage and the specific procedure performed. In conclusion, if you suspect you have a dislocation, it's important to seek prompt medical attention.

For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometres per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C).

He started his professional career in 1997 with the Seattle Seahawks and retired in 2011 as a member of the Dallas Cowboys. Throughout his career, Kitna threw for 29,745 yards and 169 touchdowns. To answer the question specifically, we need to look at the total yards of touchdowns Kitna had over his career. A touchdown in football is scored when a player advances the ball across the opponent's goal line or catches a pass in the end zone. Each touchdown is worth six points, and the team can score an additional point by kicking the ball through the opponent's goalpost or two points by running or passing it into the end zone again. In terms of Kitna's total yards of touchdowns, the NFL provides data on two types of touchdowns: passing touchdowns and rushing touchdowns. A passing touchdown is when the quarterback throws the ball to a teammate who catches it in the end zone. A rushing touchdown is when a player runs the ball into the end zone. Looking at Kitna's career statistics, he had a total of 169 touchdowns. Of those, 155 were passing touchdowns and 14 were rushing touchdowns. The total yards of those touchdowns would depend on the distance of each play that resulted in a touchdown. The NFL does not provide data on the total yards of touchdowns scored by individual players. However, we can estimate the total yards Kitna threw for based on his career passing yards. Kitna threw for 29,745 yards over the course of his career. If we assume that each passing touchdown was scored from an average distance of 20 yards, then we can calculate that Kitna threw for approximately 3,100 yards of touchdowns. This calculation is merely an estimate, and it could be higher or lower depending on the actual distances of the plays that resulted in touchdowns. In conclusion, Jon Kitna had a total of 169 touchdowns over his 16-year career in the NFL. Although we cannot determine the exact total yards of his touchdowns, we can estimate that he threw for approximately 3,100 yards of touchdowns based on his career passing yardage."},{"instruction":"The first regular season game for head coach Raheem Morris saw the Buccaneers fall to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 3421.

For most loaf recipes, 350 °F (177 °C) is the standard temperature that should be used. Preheating your oven to this temperature ensures that your bread will bake evenly and have a perfect texture. To begin, turn on your oven and set it to 350 °F (177 °C). Make sure that the oven is completely preheated before putting your loaf inside. This may take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on your oven's type and size. Preheating your oven ensures that it reaches the correct temperature and maintains it throughout the baking process. Once your oven is preheated, it's time to prepare your loaf pan. Loaf pans come in different sizes and materials, but regardless of the type you use, it's important to grease it before you start baking. Greasing the loaf pan prevents the loaf from sticking to the pan and ruining its shape. To grease your loaf pan, you can use butter, oil or non-stick spray. Apply a generous amount of your preferred greasing agent to the bottom and sides of the pan, making sure that there are no spots left uncovered. Gently spread the agent using a paper towel or pastry brush. Now it's time to put your loaf in the greased pan and place it in the preheated oven. Make sure that the pan is centered in the oven, so that the loaf bakes evenly. Avoid putting the loaf too close to the oven's walls, as this might cause uneven baking. Depending on your recipe, your loaf might take anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour to bake. Keep an eye on it and check it often using a toothpick or skewer. Insert the skewer into the center of the loaf and if it comes out clean, it means that your loaf is done. In conclusion, if you want to achieve perfect baking results, preheating your oven and greasing your loaf pan are essential steps. These simple but important tips ensure that your bread bakes evenly and doesn't stick to the pan. With practice, your loaves will turn out perfectly every time."},{"instruction":"1851, the Census of Ireland Commissioners recorded 24 harvest failure of the potato crop going back to 1728, of varying severity.

Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective.

Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics.

Secure all gates, locks, and ladders to your pool.","output":"As a parent or caregiver, it is important to take precautions when having children near or around water. The following measures should be followed to ensure the safety of the child: Firstly, it's essential to learn when to begin. Many parents are excited to introduce their children to the wonders of water, but it's crucial to wait until the child is physically and mentally ready. This means they should be able to hold their head up on their own, sit up unsupported, and have some basic motor skills. Assessing your child's health is also important. Children with certain health conditions may not be fit to be around water. For instance, a child with seizures may experience them more frequently in water. It's crucial to learn about child CPR in case of emergencies. This will equip you with life-saving techniques when the need arises. Dress your child in a special swim diaper to avoid fecal contamination of the pool water. Avoid air-filled flotation devices such as water wings, pool rings, and inflatables as they can give children a false sense of security, leading to accidents. Non-inflatable devices such as life jackets are recommended. Finally, secure all gates, locks, and ladders to your pool to prevent unauthorized access. This ensures that children are not exposed to the danger of drowning in the pool when unsupervised. In conclusion, water safety for children should not be taken for granted. Parents and caregivers should take extra measures to ensure the safety of children in and around the water. By following the precautions outlined above, we can all contribute to a safer aquatic environment for children."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = coffee shop, food = French, customer rating = high, area = city centre, familyFriendly = no","output":"Fitzbillies is a highly-rated French coffee shop located in the city centre, but it is not family-friendly."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: when does now thats what i call 100 come out?","output":"Sorry, I do not have access to real-time information.

The Enterprise's first major mission was during the Cuban Missile Crisis, where it played a crucial role in the United States' response to the Soviet Union's missile installations in Cuba. Its long and illustrious career continued for over five decades, with the ship participating in numerous operations and serving as a symbol of U.S. naval power around the world.

The special effects are poorly executed and add nothing to the overall experience. The pacing is sluggish, leading to a boring and tedious viewing experience. The film drags on, never building real momentum or picking up any real steam. It's a forgettable mess that fails to deliver any real entertainment value.

A report by the Brookings Institute last week identified nearly 46,000 Twitter accounts operated by ISIS sympathizers.

This was followed by early Christian liturgical music, which itself dates back to the Ancient Greeks[citation needed]. The development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient Greeks such as Aristoxenus and Pythagoras. Pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify musical notation. Ancient Greek instruments such as the aulos (a reed instrument) and the lyre (a stringed instrument similar to a small harp) eventually led to the modernday instruments of a classical orchestra.

Even after tourism began later in the 19th century, Bermuda remained, in the eyes of London, a base more than a colony.

Increasingly, women became the major shoppers and middleclass households. Kendals (formerly Kendal Milne & Faulkner) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal's, despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser. The Manchester institution dates back to 1836 but had been trading as Watts Bazaar since 1796. At its zenith the store had buildings on both sides of Deansgate linked by a subterranean passage Kendals Arcade and an art nouveau tiled food hall. The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname the Harrods of the North, although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919. Other large Manchester stores included Paulden's (currently Debenhams) and Lewis's (now a Primark).

Disrupt the enemy team's coordination. Reveal spies with your flamethrower. Use the compression blast to break ubercharges.","output":"In any battle, taking your enemies by surprise is a key element in gaining the upper hand. In team-based games such as first-person shooters, disrupting the enemy team's coordination is a highly effective way of achieving this. By breaking down their communication and decision-making, you can split their forces and reduce their effectiveness as a group. One way to achieve this is by using the flamethrower in games such as Team Fortress 2. This weapon not only deals damage but also reveals hidden spies. By spraying the area with flames, you can flush out any enemy spies that are infiltrating your team. This not only helps to identify and eliminate the enemy spy but also disrupts the enemy team's plans. Another highly effective tactic is to use the compression blast. This ability allows you to blast back enemies and projectiles, disrupting and disrupting the enemy team's attacks. It can also be used to break an enemy team's Ubercharge, a powerful ability that grants temporary invincibility to a player and their teammate. By using the compression blast to break the enemy team's Ubercharge, you can nullify their advantage and leave them vulnerable to attack. In conclusion, taking your enemies by surprise and disrupting their coordination in team-based games is a surefire way to gain the upper hand. Utilizing weapons and abilities such as the flamethrower and compression blast can not only deal damage but also reveal spies and break enemy team abilities. Remember, in battle, every advantage counts, and these tactics can help you secure a decisive victory."},{"instruction":"it possible to conclude that A woman holding a red balloon in a red coat. if a woman is sitting in a blizzard?

The tesserae are placed faceup on a medium (often adhesivebacked paper, sticky plastic or soft lime or putty) as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator, to avoid damaging the work.

Setting it at the right temperature can make or break your recipe, so it is important to pay attention to details. One common and much-used temperature in baking is 175 degrees Fahrenheit (79 degrees Celsius). To preheat your oven to 175 degrees Fahrenheit, first ensure that your oven is clean and free from any residual debris. Turn the oven on and wait for the preheating process to begin. Depending on your oven, this may take anywhere from five to fifteen minutes. While the oven is heating up, prepare your baking sheet or dish and gather all the ingredients you will need for your recipe. This will ensure that you are ready to start baking as soon as your oven has reached the desired temperature. When your oven has reached 175 degrees Fahrenheit, it is now time to place your baking creation inside. It is crucial to not rush this step, as placing your food inside an oven that has not reached the desired temperature can result in uneven baking and burning. Once you have placed your dish inside the oven, it is essential to keep a close watch on the food throughout the baking process. Different recipes may call for different baking times, so be sure to read and follow the instructions carefully. In conclusion, preheating your oven to the right temperature is a fundamental step in baking. For recipes calling for 175 degrees Fahrenheit (79 degrees Celsius), take the time to ensure your oven is clean, and preheat it carefully.

Looking for a city that would provide the charm of Spoleto, as well as its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces, they selected Charleston, South Carolina, as the ideal location. The historic city provided a perfect fit: intimate enough that the Festival would captivate the entire city, yet cosmopolitan enough to provide an enthusiastic audience and robust infrastructure.

While he is best known for his record-breaking kickoff and punt returns, Hester was also a dynamic receiver and occasional rusher during his career. Over the course of his 11-year career, Hester scored a total of 20 touchdowns in a variety of ways. The majority of Hester's touchdowns came on special teams. Over the course of his career, he amassed an astounding 19 return touchdowns, including 14 on punts and five on kickoffs. Hester's first touchdown of this nature came in his rookie season with the Chicago Bears, where he returned a punt 84 yards for a score. From there, he would go on to break the NFL record for most return touchdowns in history, which he now shares with fellow return specialist, Deion Sanders. In addition to his special teams prowess, Hester also scored one touchdown through the air. In 2009, while playing for the Bears, he caught a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jay Cutler in a game against the Detroit Lions. This was the only touchdown reception of Hester's career, as he primarily served as a return specialist and occasional gadget player on offense. Finally, Hester also scored one touchdown on the ground. In 2014, while playing for the Atlanta Falcons, he took a reverse handoff and ran 20 yards into the endzone for a rushing touchdown against his former team, the Chicago Bears. This was Hester's only rushing touchdown of his career. In summary, Devin Hester scored a total of 20 touchdowns over the course of his career. Of those 20 touchdowns, 19 came on special teams (14 on punts, 5 on kickoffs), 1 came through the air, and 1 came on the ground. Hester's impact as a return specialist is undeniable, and his electrifying performances will be remembered for years to come."},{"instruction":"The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as shareholders.

He also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of Alexandria, the famous Pinakes. Callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of Augustan poetry.

However, with a few simple tactics, you can make a memorable impression and set the groundwork for future interactions. To begin, establish eye contact with the person you're speaking with. Eye contact shows that you're engaged and interested in what they have to say. It's also an excellent way to demonstrate your confidence and convey your intentions. Next, pay attention to their body language. This non-verbal communication can tell you a lot about how the person is feeling and what they're interested in. If they're opening up to you, their body language will be relaxed and engaged. If they're feeling uncomfortable, they might cross their arms, look away, or fidget with their hands. As you start talking, make small talk to establish a rapport. Ask questions that go beyond surface-level topics, and try to find common ground that you can discuss. This can be challenging if you're unsure of the person's interests or experiences, but don't be afraid to delve deeper into their thoughts and opinions. Using your environment can also be a powerful tool for establishing connections. If you're at a social event, point out interesting features of the room, or make observations about the weather or the crowd. This can help you break the ice and find shared experiences. As the conversation progresses, continue to listen carefully to what the other person is saying. Demonstrate your interest by asking thoughtful questions and actively engaging with their answers. This can help you establish a deeper understanding of their perspectives and experiences. Finally, as the interaction comes to a close, ask for their contact information if it feels appropriate. Exchange phone numbers, email addresses, or social media handles you can use to keep in touch. By getting her information, you can follow-up and build on this interaction in the future. In conclusion, establishing a connection with someone doesn't have to be complicated or intimidating. By establishing eye contact, listening to body language, making small talk, using your environment, and demonstrating your interest, you can lay the groundwork for future interactions and make a memorable impression."},{"instruction":"the following sentence linguistically acceptable?

Instagram is among the top social media platforms that allow individuals to share images and videos with their followers. However, this platform has its share of challenges when it comes to privacy. Users can be exposed to scammers, cyberbullies, trolls, and other undesired activities that put their privacy at risk. One solution to this problem is making your posts private. To make your posts private on Instagram, open the app and tap on your profile. From there, locate the settings icon and tap on it. Scroll down until you find the \\"Privacy\\" section, then choose \\"Account Privacy.\\" Toggle the button to enable \\"Private Account,\\" and your posts will be visible only to followers you approve.

However, there are downsides to this action. The primary disadvantage of making your posts private is that only your followers can see them, limiting your exposure and engagement with a broader audience. To conclude, setting your posts on Instagram to private could be an excellent option if you value your privacy and security. It can help you avoid cyberbullying, trolling, and other unwanted activities that may arise from public visibility. However, keep in mind that it limits your reach and engagement with new audiences.

Plug the speeds into the formula. Multiply the product of the two speeds by 2. Add the two speeds together. Simplify the fraction.","output":"Calculating average speed is a fundamental aspect of understanding speed, distance, and time. When trying to determine an average speed, it is important to assess the information given and set up the appropriate formula. Firstly, begin by identifying the two speeds used for the same distance that you want to calculate the average speed for. Once you have these two values, you can use the formula for average speed, which is distance divided by time. However, in this scenario, the distance is constant for both speeds, so you can use a modified version of the formula, which is as follows: Average speed = 2xy / x + y Here, x and y represent the two speeds, and the product of the two speeds is multiplied by two before being added together. Once this is done, you can then simplify the fraction to find the average speed. For example, if you are given that a car travels at 50 mph for half the distance and 70 mph for the other half, you can calculate the average speed as follows: x = 50 mph y = 70 mph Average speed = 2xy / x + y Average speed = 2(50)(70) / 50 + 70 Average speed = 7,000 / 120 Average speed = 58.33 mph Therefore, the average speed of the car over the entire distance is 58.33 mph. In conclusion, assessing the information given and setting up the appropriate formula is critical for calculating average speed given two speeds used for the same distance.

To develop your model, start by studying the different parts of a cell and their functions. This will help you create a more accurate and informative representation of the cell. Once you have a good understanding of the cell, it's time to start thinking about the materials you'll use. Depending on the level of detail you want to achieve, you may need a variety of materials such as clay, cardboard, paint, and even computer software. Aim to be creative and think outside the box. You can use non-conventional materials such as candy, beans, or even shaving cream as substitutes for the various organelles inside a cell. This unconventional approach can create an interesting and visually appealing model for your project. It is also important to consider the size and level of detail for your model. A larger model may allow for more intricate detail, but it could become too cumbersome to move around. Keep in mind the portability of your model, especially if it needs to be transported to a school or science fair.
