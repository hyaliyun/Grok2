The game was played at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith had been tasked with creating a new indoor sport that could be played during the winter months. Naismith's original rules called for a ball to be thrown into a goal, similar to the game of soccer. However, this format proved too difficult to manage indoors with the limited space available. Naismith then adjusted the rules to allow for a goal to be scored when a player threw the ball into a box that was affixed to a wall about 10 feet above the floor. In that first game, which consisted of nine players on each team, Naismith himself did not score the first field goal. Instead, a player named William R. Chase made the first recorded basket in the game's history. Since then, the game of basketball has evolved significantly, with the introduction of the NBA, WNBA, and countless amateur and professional leagues around the world. However, the legacy of Naismith's innovation lives on, as basketball remains one of the world's most beloved and widely-played sports."},{"instruction":"ping to rebound from their road loss to the Panthers, the Cardinals flew to the Edward Jones Dome for a Week 9 NFC West duel with the St. Louis Rams.

By doing this, you can discover what type of activities your date enjoys and tailor further dates accordingly. While it's not necessary to pay for every single date, it's a good idea to at least offer to pay for the first few. This is a simple way to show that you are willing to invest time and effort into the relationship. Overall, successful dating requires respect, responsibility, and a willingness to explore new experiences. Keep these principles in mind, and your dating experience is sure to be enjoyable and fulfilling."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: Sohn first competed in the 1,500 and 5,000 m, but turned to longer distances after winning an eightmile race in October 1933.

Many scientists, including Pasteur, had unsuccessfully attempted to extract the fermentation enzyme from yeast. Success came in 1897 when the German chemist Eduard Buechner ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement that this \`\`dead'' liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much like living yeasts. Buechner's results are considered to mark the birth of biochemistry. The \`\`unorganized ferments'' behaved just like the organized ones. From that time on, the term enzyme came to be applied to all ferments. It was then understood that fermentation is caused by enzymes that are produced by microorganisms.

So city residents had to get creative—and political—in their efforts to clear the streets, per the BBC: They spraypainted the name of opposition leader and Putin basher Alexei Navalny onto the snow. The ploy has appeared to somewhat work, with some saying city workers came out within hours to deal with the graffitied snow. The BBC notes not all the snow was cleared—in some cases, the workers just moved the snow around to cover up or erase Navalny's name. Still, with photos being spread on social media and some of the snow taken away, organizers view their efforts as a success. Now everyone in the country and beyond knows that the surname 'Navalny' is not just a surname, but a curse that forces people to work, a local residents group wrote on its Facebook page.

The 51-year-old, from Kensington, London, is thought to have made £1m in what has been described as a scam. The medical panel has condemned Harrison for his \\"flippant, cavalier and deplorable\\" attitude towards the administering of Botox. Harrison's actions not only put patients at risk but also undermine the integrity of the medical profession. The idea that anyone with enough money can learn how to inject Botox without proper medical training is alarming, particularly when it is done in an unregulated environment. Botulinum toxin is a prescription-only medicine and should only be administered by those with medical training. In the wrong hands, Botox can cause serious harm, including nerve damage and paralysis. Harrison's actions reveal a lack of professionalism and a disregard for the wellbeing of patients. The revelation that Harrison charged nurses such a high fee for his training courses is particularly concerning. It suggests that he was motivated by financial gain rather than a desire to improve the quality of care provided to patients. Given the potential risks associated with Botox, particularly when administered incorrectly, it seems particularly egregious that Harrison would encourage non-medical professionals to perform the procedure. It is imperative that medical professionals act with the utmost professionalism and put the safety of patients first. The actions of Dr Mark Harrison fly in the face of this principle and demonstrate a lack of concern for patients' wellbeing. The medical profession must take steps to ensure that such behavior is not tolerated in the future. The safety of patients must be prioritized over financial gain."},{"instruction":"hina 's move to promote digital tv broadcasting will provide domestic tv makers with fresh opportunities .

Banksy painted the piece on a building in Bristol before posting it online for the world to see. The piece is a testament to Banksy's wit and creativity. The use of the alarm box as a substitution for the pearl earring is humorous and unique. It is also a nod to Banksy's ethos of questioning authority and challenging societal norms. By using an object commonly associated with security and safety as a fashion accessory, Banksy is highlighting the absurdity of our current world and the ways in which we perceive safety. The artwork is also a commentary on the role of street art in contemporary society. Banksy's decision to paint on the side of a building is an intentional one. Street art is a form of artistic expression that challenges traditional notions of where art can and cannot exist. By painting on the side of a building, Banksy is reclaiming public space and transforming it into a canvas for his art.

The simplest are unjointed and form paired bundles near the top and bottom of each side of each segment. The parapodia (limbs) of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips – for example jointed, comblike or hooked. Chetae are made of moderately flexible βchitin and are formed by follicles, each of which has a chetoblast (hairforming) cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta. The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming microvilli, fine hairlike extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta. When the cheta is complete, the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta. Hence annelids' chetae are structurally different from the setae (bristles) of arthropods, which are made of the more rigid αchitin, have a single internal cavity, and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle.

Place the turkey in the basket or attach it to the hanger. Slowly lower the turkey into the oil. Cook the turkey to a temperature of 165 °F (74 °C). Slowly lift the turkey out of the oil when it's time to check it. Test the temperature in both thighs and both sides of the breast. Allow the turkey to rest for 20 minutes before carving.","output":"Frying a turkey can be a great alternative to the traditional roasted turkey for Thanksgiving or any other special occasion. However, improper cooking techniques can lead to an unsafe and unappetizing meal. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to fry a turkey properly. First, prepare the turkey for frying by removing the giblets and neck, and patting it dry with paper towels. Make sure the turkey is completely thawed and at room temperature. Next, fill a large pot with enough oil to completely cover the turkey, leaving at least 3 inches of space from the top to prevent boiling over. Light the burner and monitor the oil using a thermometer until it reaches 350 °F (177 °C). Attach the turkey to a hanger or place it in a basket for easy insertion and removal from the hot oil. Slowly lower the turkey into the oil, and be cautious of any splattering. Cook the turkey for approximately 3 to 4 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C). Monitor the temperature of the oil throughout the cooking process to maintain a consistent heat level. When it is time to check the turkey’s temperature, slowly lift it out of the oil and place it on a wire rack to drain excess oil. Test the temperature in both thighs and both sides of the breast using a meat thermometer to ensure it has reached a safe temperature. Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20 minutes before carving to allow the juices to redistribute within the meat. This resting period will also prevent any accidental burns from the hot oil, and allow for easy carving without losing too much moisture. In conclusion, frying a turkey can be an exciting and delicious way to switch things up during special occasions. However, it is important to follow proper techniques to ensure a safe and enjoyable meal. Remember to monitor the temperature of the oil, use a thermometer to check the turkey’s temperature, and allow the turkey to rest before carving. Enjoy your delicious and juicy fried turkey!"},{"instruction":"Data: AlTaqaddum Air Base, location, Habbaniyah Sentence about the following d","output":"Al-Taqaddum Air Base is located in Habbaniyah."},{"instruction":"What can we do so that next generation does not smoke?

In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day.

This may seem like a surprising idea, but it can actually bring wonderful benefits to your hair. When you rinse your hair with cold milk, you can get a softer feel and a fantastic shine that can make your locks look and feel healthier. The process of using milk for your hair is simple. All you need to do is fill up a cup with cold milk and pour it over your hair once you're done shampooing and conditioning. Make sure to distribute the milk evenly over your hair and massage it into your scalp. You can leave it on for a few minutes for maximum effect. Then rinse it off with cool water. Why does milk work for hair care? Milk contains several nutrients that can nourish your hair and help it become more manageable. The proteins in milk can strengthen your hair strands and reduce breakage, while the lactic acid can remove dead skin cells and stimulate hair growth. Additionally, the fat in milk can moisturize your hair and leave it feeling soft and silky. The result is a smoother, shinier, and healthier-looking hair. Moreover, using milk for hair care is an affordable and natural alternative to commercial hair treatments that contain harsh chemicals. You don't need to buy expensive products or go to a salon to get the benefits of milk for your hair. You can simply use the milk you have at home.

This percentage has remained relatively stable over the past few decades, with slight fluctuations from year to year. The Census Bureau defines a family household as a household maintained by one or more people who are related to each other by birth, marriage, or adoption. This can include a married couple with or without children, a single parent with children, or a household with relatives living together. Non-family households, which make up the remaining 34.7% of households in the US, are defined as households where the occupants are not related to each other. This can include people living alone, cohabiting partners, or unrelated roommates. The percentage of family households varies by state and region. For example, the Midwest has the highest percentage of family households at 72.3%, while the West has the lowest at 60.9%. Similarly, states with higher rates of marriage and childbearing tend to have higher percentages of family households. It is important to note that family structures have become more diverse in recent years, with an increase in non-traditional family structures such as same-sex parents, blended families, and multi-generational households. The Census Bureau has adapted its definition of family households to better reflect these changes. In conclusion, as of 2019, 65.3% of households in the US were considered families, with the remaining 34.7% classified as non-family households.

To keep your linen items in good condition, it is essential to follow a few key steps. The first step is to soak the linen item in a hot water bath with a stain treatment additive. This will help to remove any stains or dirt from the fabric. Allow the linen to soak for at least 30 minutes, or longer if necessary, then rinse thoroughly. After soaking the linen, lay it out in the sun. The sun is a great natural bleaching agent and can help to brighten and whiten the fabric. Be sure to lay the linen out flat and turn it over a few times to ensure even drying.

Use a low heat setting on your iron and make sure to iron both sides of the linen to prevent any creases or wrinkles. If ironing is not needed, hang dry the linen item.

This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the Formula of Concord. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The Book of Concord replaced earlier, incomplete collections of doctrine, unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.

The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice, particularly the liver. They also interpreted omens, prodigies and portents, and formulated their expiation. Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient, ethnically Etruscan outsider religious profession, separate from Rome's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy, essential but never quite respectable. During the midtolate Republic, the reformist Gaius Gracchus, the populist politiciangeneral Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla, and the notorious Verres justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners. The senate and armies used the public haruspices: at some time during the late Republic, the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination. Being of independent means, they would be better motivated to maintain a pure, religious practice for the public good. The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect: none of this seems to have troubled Marius, who employed a Syrian prophetess.

While her height might be seen as an advantage in some areas, Amazon Eve worried she would never find love due to her towering stature. However, fate had other plans. At the age of 14, Amazon Eve was already 5ft 9, towering over her classmates. As she grew older, she found it hard to date as shorter men saw her as a mother figure rather than a romantic interest. This made it difficult for her to find someone who saw her for who she truly is. But her worries disappeared when she met her boyfriend, Dennis, who is in his 60s and stands tall at 6ft 4in. Interestingly, she met Dennis when he was her accountant. Despite the 20-year age difference, the couple is deeply in love, proving that height really doesn't matter when two people are meant to be together. Amazon Eve's story is a reminder that love comes in all shapes and sizes. Regardless of one's height or any other physical difference, it is possible to find true love. It's heartwarming to see two people who come from different backgrounds and have seemingly different physical attributes come together and form a meaningful, loving relationship. Amazon Eve's story is an inspiration to anyone who has ever felt that their physical appearance might limit their chances of finding love."},{"instruction":"Data: name = The Plough, eatType = pub, food = Indian, priceRange = moderate, familyFriendly = no, near = Café Rouge.

It was also thought the bombing of residential centres would cause a collapse of civilian will, which might have led to the collapse of production and civil life.

Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a longrange aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat.

By using meta tags, you improve your site's chances of being displayed high on a list of search engine results. OPTIONS: Decide what keywords you will list in your meta tags. These keywords should be relevant to your site's content. Target your search engines to your keywords. Meta tags tend to focus on your keywords. Furthermore, meta tags lead to fewer search engines who search for keywords and instead send you products with smart apps or applications that can help you search for keywords. Meta tags are dynamic pieces of code that help to define what your site will and will not be displayed. Choose the size of your website or website. Meta tags can be expanded to make your site more abbreviated, so your smaller website or website will yield at least 1 html tag.","output":"Decide what keywords you will list in your meta tags.

The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.

Start with your interests outside of work. Use volunteer work to your advantage. Go into your previous work experience. Keep things light with appropriate humor. Respond quickly and confidently.","output":"In a professional setting, it is common to be met with situations where communication may not always be crystal clear. Rather than being too shy or concerned about how you may appear, it is essential to ask for clarification, especially when it comes to instructions or directives. Doing so will showcase your willingness to learn and ensure that there are no misunderstandings, ultimately leading to greater success. However, in a job interview, there may be instances where communication can feel daunting. An effective strategy to help break the ice and ease into the conversation is to talk about your interests outside of work. Typically, interviewers ask candidates to introduce themselves, including their hobbies, which can help establish a connection with the interviewer. This can act as an excellent icebreaker to help the conversation feel more relaxed and natural, leading to better communication. Another way to showcase your skills outside of work is through your volunteer endeavors. Whether you spend your free time organizing fundraisers or helping with local charities, this can reflect highly on your character and display the skills that make you unique. If you have a history of volunteering, be sure to use it to your advantage by sharing your experiences during the interview. Apart from your extracurricular activities, your previous work experience is also a crucial topic to discuss during a job interview. Make sure to highlight the skills you have gained from your work experiences and use them to demonstrate how you can bring value to the company. If you have relevant experience and can describe how it helped you grow professionally and develop new skill sets, this can help you stand out among other candidates. While it's essential to demonstrate your professionalism during the interview, it doesn't mean you need to be overly serious. Adding a touch of appropriate humor to the conversation can help to lighten the mood and alleviate some of the stress that comes with a job interview. However, it is also important to be mindful of striking the right balance, as inappropriate humor can damage your credibility. Lastly, being quick and confident in your responses can help to showcase your communication skills and demonstrate your ability to think on your feet. While taking time to formulate thoughtful responses is essential, taking too long to answer can make you appear indecisive or unprepared. In summary, asking for clarification, highlighting your interests, leveraging your volunteer experience, discussing your previous work experience, using appropriate humor, and responding confidently are all essential elements to bear in mind when preparing for a job interview. Remember, being yourself and showcasing your unique qualities will make you stand out among the other candidates."},{"instruction":"f A woman in pink pants and a black tank top displays the tattoo on her back., does it logically follow that Naked woman displays tattoo on her vagina.?

The move sees him reunited with former Tottenham manager, Harry Redknapp, who signed him from Internacional in 2009. Sandro spent four years at Tottenham, where he became a fan favourite with his aggressive style of play and tenacious midfield performances. However, it seemed unlikely that he would return to the Premier League after his move to Turkish club, Antalyaspor, in 2017. But Redknapp has managed to secure Sandro's services for QPR, for just £10million. This is significantly less than the original £16million that Tottenham were asking for, as they wanted double the £8million they paid for Sandro in 2010. The move to QPR will see Sandro play a key role in defensive midfield and help bolster the team's chances of promotion to the Premier League. He will also provide valuable experience to a young and developing squad. QPR fans are understandably excited about Sandro's return to Loftus Road, and will be hoping that he can replicate his outstanding performances from his time at Tottenham. With Redknapp at the helm and Sandro in the midfield, the team has a great chance of making their way back to the top flight of English football."},{"instruction":"Which king was known as ‘Lackland’?

Nasser did not believe that a lowranking officer like himself (a lieutenant colonel) would be accepted by the Egyptian people, and so selected General Naguib to be his boss and lead the coup in name. The revolution they had long sought was launched on 22 July and was declared a success the next day. The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo. While many of the rebel officers were leading their units, Nasser donned civilian clothing to avoid detection by royalists and moved around Cairo monitoring the situation. In a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution, Nasser had notified the American and British governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to aid Farouk.

The trust then threatened to sack her if she spoke out again, which has been seen as being totally at odds with repeated Government assurances. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright's case highlights once again the importance of speaking out when wrongs are believed to be occurring, particularly within the NHS, which is one of the most trusted institutions within the UK. If employees are not able to speak out without fear of repercussions, it is likely that serious issues will go unnoticed and unaddressed. It is therefore encouraging to see that Mr Hunt has intervened in this case, and it is to be hoped that he will ensure that Mrs Haynes Kirkbright is treated fairly, and that issues of transparency and accountability within the NHS are addressed in order to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Overall, Mrs Haynes Kirkbright's case serves as a reminder that we must always be vigilant in ensuring that our most important institutions are held accountable for their actions, and that individuals who speak out should be protected from reprisals. Only by doing so can we ensure that the NHS remains a trusted and effective institution for years to come."},{"instruction":"Six people were killed and 10 injured on Tuesday in a gun battle between rival militiamen in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, witnesses and clan elders said.

In order to avert a default (as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets), in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries, and the IMF, agreed to a rescue package which involved giving Greece an immediate €45 billion in bailout loans, with more funds to follow, totaling €110 billion.

The accusations of altering footage to support the Muslim Brotherhood further undermine the credibility of the trial. The journalists involved in the case have denied any wrongdoing and maintain that they were simply doing their jobs as reporters. The accusations against them demonstrate the dangers faced by journalists working in countries with repressive regimes and highlight the importance of press freedom.

One of the most famous examples is the \\"Basilica Cannon,\\" which was capable of firing a 300-kilogram stone ball at the city's defenses. In addition, the Ottomans strategically placed their cannons in such a way that they could target weak points in the fortifications, such as gaps or areas that were already damaged. This allowed them to breach the walls and gain access to the city. The Ottomans also employed skilled engineers and builders who were able to construct innovative siege machines such as mobile towers and covered trenches, which protected their soldiers while they were approaching the walls. Finally, the Ottomans had a large and well-trained army that was able to carry out a coordinated attack. They were able to adapt to changing circumstances and respond to the defenses put up by the defenders.

I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan. Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid. One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little.

Whether it's walking home from work at night or simply being in our own homes, there are steps we can take to increase our safety. Here are a few tips to keep in mind: - Avoid dangerous places. It's always best to steer clear of areas that are known to be high-crime or have a reputation for being unsafe. If possible, take a different route or plan your activities during daylight hours. - Be aware of your surroundings. Pay attention to who and what is around you at all times. Don't walk around with your headphones on or your head buried in your phone - this can make you an easy target for muggers or other criminals. - Use the \\"back off\\" command. If someone is making you feel uncomfortable or threatened, firmly tell them to \\"back off\\" or leave you alone. This can be an effective way to deter potential attackers. - Take self-defense. Knowing how to defend yourself will give you greater confidence and could even save your life in the event of an attack. Look into local classes or online tutorials. - Create obstacles to entering your home. This could include installing a security system, putting up a fence, or simply making sure your doors and windows are locked at all times. - Report suspicious activity. If you notice something strange or out of the ordinary, don't hesitate to contact the authorities. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Remember - your safety is always the top priority.
