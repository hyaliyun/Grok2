The game took place on a field in Hoboken, New Jersey and was the first intercollegiate football contest ever played. At the time, the rules of football were still in their early stages of development, and the game resembled more of a hybrid between soccer and rugby. During the fourth quarter of the game, Rutgers player William J. Leggett kicked a ball over the opposing team's goalpost, and the referees ruled that it counted as a field goal. At the time, the goalposts were placed 25 feet apart, and a team could score a goal by either kicking the ball over the goalpost or by advancing it across the opposing team's goal line. The game ended with Rutgers winning 6-4, with each team scoring only one goal apiece. Despite the low scoring game, it was a pivotal moment in the history of football, as it marked the beginning of intercollegiate play and helped to establish the rules and regulations for the game that we know and love today. In conclusion, the first field goal in football history was kicked in the fourth quarter of a game between Princeton and Rutgers on November 6, 1869. This historic moment helped to lay the foundation for the sport we know today and marked the beginning of a long and storied history of football in America."},{"instruction":"Write a positive movie review.","output":"\\"Joker\\" is an intense and gripping film that takes a unique look at the iconic comic book villain's origin story.

According to Human Rights Watch, BIAs undermine the ICC's mandate to investigate and prosecute international crimes. They restrict the ICC's ability to hold perpetrators accountable for serious crimes, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. 2.

Make sure to store the eels under the right conditions. Locate the bass. Hook the eels. Cast the eel out. Reel in the striped bass.","output":"Live Eels: A Great Bait for Striped Bass Fishing If you are looking for a bait that is highly effective for catching striped bass, then live eels should be on your list. These slimy creatures are a staple for many anglers targeting these popular game fish. But why exactly are eels so effective, and how should you use them? Firstly, live eels are a big favorite of striped bass due to their natural movement and scent. They are large enough to attract bigger and more mature fish, yet small enough to swallow whole, making them an easy target for striped bass. Secondly, eels are hardy creatures that can survive for days in the right conditions, allowing anglers to keep them alive until they are ready to use them. To start, it's important to store your live eels properly to ensure they remain lively and healthy. You can keep them in a well-aerated container with clean seawater at a temperature between 50-65°F. Make sure to change the water frequently and avoid overcrowding to prevent stress on the eels. Next, you will need to locate the striped bass. These fish are often found near rocky structures, drop-offs or in saltwater bays. Once you have identified your spot, it's time to hook your eel. To do this, insert the hook into the eel's head, just behind the eyes. This will allow the eel to swim naturally and freely. Now it's time to cast your eel out. Look for a spot where the water is deeper and the current is swift enough to carry the eel but not too much that it gets washed away. Expert anglers recommend casting a bit upstream of your intended target and letting the current carry the eel towards the fish. Finally, when the eel is taken by the striped bass, you will need to reel in the fish. Depending on the size of the fish, you may need to exert some strength to get the fish onboard. Make sure to maintain a tight line, utilizing a drag mechanism, to keep the fish from shaking its head and throwing the hook. In summary, live eels are a favored bait for striped bass fishing due to their natural movement and scent. Ensure that you store them under the right conditions and hook them properly before casting them out. By following these tips, you may soon find yourself reeling in the catch of the day.

With DVDs being more durable and portable than VHS tapes, transferring your old videos to DVD can help protect them from loss or damage. Fortunately, the process of transferring VHS tapes to DVD is easier than you might think. First, you'll need to hook up your VCR to your external DVD burner. You can do this by connecting the video output from your VCR to the video input on the DVD burner using an RCA cable. You'll also need to connect the audio output from your VCR to the audio input on the DVD burner using another RCA cable. Once you've got everything hooked up, you can activate the video transfer process on the DVD burner. This may involve pressing a button on the machine or navigating through an on-screen menu. Be sure to follow the instructions included with your DVD burner to ensure that you're doing everything correctly. With the transfer process activated, your DVD burner will start recording the video from your VCR onto a blank DVD. Depending on the length of the tape, this process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Once the transfer is complete, you'll have a brand new DVD backup of your VHS tape that you can play on any DVD player. Overall, transferring VHS tapes to DVD is a simple process that can help you preserve your cherished memories for years to come.

However, it's important to give every inch of our skin the attention it deserves. One area that often gets overlooked is our arms. Here are three simple steps to give your arms some TLC. Firstly, exfoliate your arms. Just like with our faces, our arms can accumulate dead skin cells that can leave them looking dull and feeling rough. Exfoliating once or twice a week can help remove those dead skin cells, revealing brighter and smoother skin. You can use a body scrub or a dry brush to exfoliate your arms. Secondly, trim excess hair with electric clippers. While having hair on your arms is entirely natural, excess hair can be unsightly and make your arms look unkempt. Electric clippers are an easy and pain-free way to trim any excess hair quickly. Just make sure to use a guard to avoid going too short. Lastly, rinse your arms. After exfoliating and trimming excess hair, it's essential to rinse your arms thoroughly to remove any leftover product or hair trimmings. This will ensure your arms are clean and ready for moisturizer or any other skincare products you use regularly. In conclusion, taking care of your arms is just as crucial as taking care of your face. By following these three simple steps - exfoliating, trimming excess hair, and rinsing - you can give your arms the attention they deserve and keep them looking their best."},{"instruction":"The Syrup Mess<br>Megan was eating pancakes in bed.

The freshman suffered major brain trauma after being knocked unconscious during a hazing ritual, and his fraternity brothers failed to seek medical help for more than an hour on the night of December 8.

The situation became even more disturbing when police found drugs and torture documents in the rented Poconos home where the hazing occurred during a retreat. All the students involved were attending Baruch College in New York. The fraternity brothers responsible for the hazing now face potential homicide charges. This unfortunate incident should serve as a wake-up call for anyone involved in Greek life. Hazing can never be justified, and the consequences of such irresponsible behavior can be severe. Instead of fostering a sense of brotherhood, hazing can cause irreparable harm and can lead to tragic events like the death of Michael Deng. It is important for universities and law enforcement to take a firm stance against hazing and to ensure that students are educated on the dangers of such activities. Fraternities and sororities need to reevaluate their values and practices, and members should be held accountable for any hazing or dangerous behavior that occurs. We must remember that the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their involvement in Greek life, should be a top priority.

By 2000, that number had increased to 20.9%. To calculate the percentage increase, we can use the formula (new value - old value) / old value * 100. Thus, the percentage increase in the number of obese adults from 1990 to 2000 can be calculated as (20.9 - 11.1) / 11.1 * 100 = 88.29%. Therefore, the percentage of obese adults in 2000 was 88.29% higher than in 1990. To find out how many more adults were obese in 2000 than in 1990 in terms of percentage, we can use the percentage increase. If we assume a population of 100 adults in 1990, 11.1 of them would be obese. In 2000, the population of obese adults would have increased by 88.29%, which equals to 10.04. Therefore, the number of obese adults in 2000 would be 11.1 + 10.04 = 21.14.

After the Opium War in 1842, Xiamen (Amoy) became one of the major treaty ports to be opened for trade with the outside world.

This caused Amoy dialect to gradually replace the position of dialect variants from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. From mid19th century until the end of World War II, western diplomats usually learned Amoy Hokkien as the preferred dialect if they were to communicate with the Hokkienspeaking populace in China or SouthEast Asia.

The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered nullhomotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point.

Select Settings and then System Settings. Select Storage. Highlight any storage device and press the yellow Y button. Select Clear System Cache and then confirm.","output":"Article: If you are experiencing issues with your Xbox 360, such as freezing, lagging, or errors, then it's possible that clearing the cache might help. The cache is temporary storage that the Xbox uses to speed up game loading and other operations. However, over time, the cache can become corrupted or bloated, leading to performance problems. Therefore, to improve your Xbox's performance and solve any trouble, you should try clearing the cache. Here's how to clear the cache on your Xbox 360: Step 1 - Press the Guide button on your Xbox controller. This button is the silver one in the middle of your controller, with the green Xbox logo. Step 2 - Select \\"Settings\\" from the menu that appears, which is located to the right of the Guide button. Step 3 - Select \\"System Settings\\" from the \\"Settings\\" menu, which will take you to another menu of options. Step 4 - Go to \\"Storage,\\" which is the last option in the System Settings menu, and press A (the green button) to select it. Step 5 - Highlight any storage device, such as the Hard Drive of your Xbox, and press the yellow \\"Y\\" button on your controller. This will bring up a new menu of options. Step 6 - Select \\"Clear System Cache\\" among the options, which will prompt you to confirm whether you want to delete the cache. Step 7 - Choose \\"Yes\\" to confirm that you want to clear the cache. It may take a few moments for the process to complete, depending on the size of your cache. Step 8 - Once the cache is cleared, restart your Xbox 360 by pressing and holding down the power button on your console for several seconds until it turns off, then turn it back on again. By clearing the cache, you are essentially wiping clean all the temporary files that the Xbox has saved on its storage. This action can help fix issues and improve performance, but it may also reset some settings, such as sound, video, and network preferences. Therefore, you may need to adjust them again after clearing the cache. In conclusion, if your Xbox 360 is acting up, don't panic, try clearing the cache first. This simple process can often resolve many issues and prevent you from having to resort to more drastic measures, such as resetting the console or contacting customer support. Remember to clear the cache regularly, since it can accumulate junk files over time and cause problems. Happy gaming!"},{"instruction":"w do you remove PVA glue on skin?

This rare condition causes fat to be stored under the muscles, rather than the normal way around. As a result, Vicky has a lean body but suffers from excessive fat storage on her arms and legs, making it difficult for her to wear tight clothing. Despite not working out, Vicky is constantly asked how often she goes to the gym. This can be frustrating for her since she, unfortunately, has no control over the storage of her fat. This condition has caused her to feel self-conscious about her body and avoid social situations that call for her to show her arms or legs. Moreover, Vicky has been terrified of passing this condition on to her daughter if she had one. However, after consulting doctors, she learned that lipodystrophy is not an inherited condition. This encouraged Vicky to focus on diet and lifestyle changes, including a clean diet and walking to keep active. While living with lipodystrophy has not been easy, Vicky has stayed strong and managed to live a healthy life.

With no need for hooks, these curtains are easy to install and remove, making them a great choice for those who want a hassle-free solution. Another important factor to keep in mind is the weight of the curtain. Heavier curtains may require additional support or hardware to keep them in place.

By adding magnets to the bottom hem of the curtains, they will be less likely to blow around in the wind or be disturbed by drafts. This can be particularly useful for those who live in windy areas or have windows that face the elements. For larger windows, an extra wide curtain may be necessary.

However, there are certain situations where knowing how to pick a lock can come in handy, such as locking yourself out of your own house. In this article, we will guide you on how to make a lock pick and tension wrench with bobby pins, or with paper clips if you don't have any bobby pins. Firstly, let's start with the materials you will need. If you have bobby pins available, then those will be the perfect tools to use. However, if you cannot find any bobby pins, then paper clips will work just fine. You will need two bobby pins or paper clips for this process. To make a tension wrench, straighten out one of the bobby pins and bend it at a 90-degree angle, making it look like an \\"L\\" shape. If you are using a paper clip, then bend the clip into the same \\"L\\" shape. This will be the tool that you use to apply pressure on the lock's pins while you pick them. Next, it is time to make the lock pick. Take your second bobby pin or a paper clip, and straighten it out. Bend the very tip of the pin paper clip into a curved angle, resembling the hook of a fishing hook. This will be the tool that you use to lift the pins in the lock so that they release. Now that you have your tools ready, it's time to start picking the lock. Insert the bent end of your tension wrench into the keyhole of the lock, and rotate it in the same direction that you would turn a key to open the lock. Apply some pressure with your wrench so that you create tension on the pins and slightly lift the lock mechanism. Insert your single-pin pick into the lock and push it all the way back. With light pressure, push up the pin at the back of the lock using your pick. When you feel a click, it means that you have lifted that pin completely. Now, move on to the other pins in the lock using your pick. Apply light pressure on each pin and try to lift them all until you hear clicks, indicating that each pin has been lifted completely. Lastly, pull your pins and tension wrench out of the lock. If you applied the right amount of pressure, the lock should have turned and unlocked. In conclusion, knowing how to pick a lock can be a helpful skill in certain situations. If you don't have access to traditional lock-picking tools, bobby pins or paper clips can make do for the job. However, it is essential to note that lock picking is not always legal, and we encourage you only to use this technique in emergency situations or with the proper permissions."},{"instruction":"week 7, the Lions hosted the Atlanta Falcons.

Firstly, make sure to choose a cage that is spacious enough for your bird to move around freely. A base size of at least 40 by 30 inches is recommended, as it allows room for perches, toys, and other essential items. Speaking of perches, be sure to incorporate plenty of them into your bird's cage. Different sized perches made of various materials will help keep your bird's feet healthy and exercised. Additionally, by allowing for different resting spots, you'll help your bird feel more at home. No bird cage is complete without a variety of toys to play with. This is especially important for birds that spend a significant amount of time in their cages. Providing toys can reduce boredom and increase mental stimulation, which ultimately leads to a happier and healthier bird. Lastly, consider the location of your bird's cage within your home. Place the cage in a high-traffic area, such as a living room or family room, where your bird can interact with family members and observe daily activities. Natural light is also essential for most species of birds, so try to position the cage near a window that receives sunlight throughout the day.

According to recent data, more than one in five British men are now classified as obese. This indicates that obesity is not only affecting adults but also children, as they are developing unhealthy lifestyles from the onset. Obesity is a significant public health concern as it can lead to various health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, strokes, and some types of cancer. In addition to this, obesity is also linked to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which can further impact an individual's wellbeing and quality of life. To tackle this issue, the UK government has implemented various strategies to promote healthy eating and physical exercise. The government has also made efforts to encourage schools to provide healthy meals during lunch breaks, as well as implementing programs to promote regular exercise among students. Despite these efforts, the alarming obesity levels among British men point to the need for more concrete actions. Individuals must take responsibility for their health by practicing healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity. Engaging in regular exercise can reduce the risk of developing chronic health conditions and improve overall wellbeing.

The earliest recorded uprising in Upper Austria dates back to the 15th century, with subsequent uprisings occurring in the 16th and 17th centuries. However, it wasn't until the 18th century that the number of uprisings increased significantly. This was largely due to the growing influence of Enlightenment ideals and the spread of revolutionary ideas across Europe. The 18th century saw a total of 21 uprisings in Upper Austria, with the most significant being the Peasants' War of 1626, the Linz Uprising of 1733, and the Salzburg Rebellion of 1800. These uprisings were characterized by clashes between peasants and nobles or between different classes of peasants, with demands ranging from better working conditions to political rights. The 19th century also saw a significant number of uprisings, with a total of 32 recorded uprisings occurring between 1801 and 1895. These uprisings were largely driven by social and economic factors, such as the increasing tensions between workers and factory owners during the Industrial Revolution. The last recorded uprising in Upper Austria occurred in 1919, after the end of World War I. This uprising was sparked by the economic struggles faced by returning soldiers and workers, and resulted in a general strike that lasted for several weeks.

By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenicbased pesticides were dominant. Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide.

This research not only sheds light on the intelligence of these avian creatures, but also raises questions about the nature of intelligence itself.

One important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as a separate discipline to astrology.

He claimed to have observed Venus as a spot on the Sun. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model.

From revolutionaries singing \\"The Internationale\\" during Soviet Russia to anti-Vietnam War songs like Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Fortunate Son,\\" music has played a significant role in inspiring and fueling social and political movements.

While this may seem like a sound strategy, experts admit that identifying who is at risk is a difficult task. The problem lies in the fact that current risk assessment tools used by doctors to identify potential heart disease patients do not take into account all the relevant factors. For example, a person may have normal cholesterol levels but still be at high risk due to factors such as smoking, diabetes or high blood pressure. Despite this limitation, cholesterol-lowering drugs continue to be prescribed as a preventative measure, with doctors erring on the side of caution. However, this approach has its own set of challenges as many patients may not adhere to the recommended dosages, leading to ineffective treatment and potentially unnecessary expenditure. A more effective strategy would be to identify those who are truly at risk of heart disease, rather than assuming all patients with high cholesterol levels are predisposed to the condition. This could involve a more comprehensive risk analysis that factors in lifestyle, medical history and genetic predisposition. In conclusion, while cholesterol-lowering drugs have their place in the treatment and prevention of heart disease, it is important to identify the appropriate patients who would benefit from them. A more proactive approach to identifying those at risk, along with better patient education and adherence to recommended dosages, could lead to more effective drug therapy and potentially reduce the high cost to the NHS."},{"instruction":"Please add punctuation to this: The lumberjacks were paid with monthly checks and Seattle businesses charged a substantial fee ranging from ten to twenty percent to cash those checks Pennell would cash the checks for free","output":"The lumberjacks were paid with monthly checks, and Seattle businesses charged a substantial fee ranging from ten to twenty percent to cash those checks.

However, the men did not press charges and left the residence. Later that evening, the police received another complaint that Boyd was holding her male roommate against his will for sex. The police responded to the call and arrested Boyd for false imprisonment. She is now facing charges for her actions.

It has the same chemical composition as rocks relatively common on Earth, found in rift zones like Hawaii's volcanoes, Wired reports. They develop in highpressure conditions, often near water, though it's unclear if that's how this one formed, notes USA Today. The discovery of the rock, nicknamed Jake Matijevic in honor of a late NASA engineer, doesn't quite fit with the rover's mission to find conditions for life; Curiosity was analyzing it primarily in order to test instruments like an Xray spectrometer and a laser blaster. Meanwhile, the bright object that Curiosity earlier found is probably just a piece of the rover itself, engineers say—either tubing or bonding material that fell off the rover. Either way, it’s completely inconsequential to the rover’s function, says a scientist working on the mission.

It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes.

The Office for National Statistics recently released figures pointing to the surge in cases. Experts believe that the rise in cancers could be partly attributed to people's choice of clothing and their failure to cover up. Such behavior increases exposure to harmful UV radiation, which increases the risk of developing skin cancer. The statistics are a stark reminder of the dangers of smoking and alcohol consumption. Smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer, while excessive drinking is linked to liver and other types of cancer. These findings should prompt individuals to reassess their lifestyle choices and make necessary changes to improve their overall health. Efforts to raise awareness about the risks associated with smoking and drinking have been ongoing. Governments worldwide have launched campaigns to discourage the excessive use of tobacco and alcohol. Such initiatives include raising taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, restricting their sale to minors, and introducing graphic warnings on cigarette packages. However, there is still much work to be done to reduce the number of people affected by preventable cancers. The public needs to understand that their actions today could have a significant impact on their health in the future. Small changes in lifestyle choices, such as covering up and avoiding excessive drinking and smoking, can go a long way in reducing cancer risk.

GUM became a major propaganda purveyor, with advertising and promotional campaigns that taught Russians the goals of the regime and attempted to inculcate new attitudes and behavior. In trying to create a socialist consumer culture from scratch, GUM recast the functions and meanings of buying and selling, turning them into politically charged acts that could either contribute to or delay the march toward utopian communism.

Microwave on medium power. Stir the honey.

Here's a quick guide on how to microwave honey safely. Step 1: Choose the right container. Make sure it's microwave-safe and won't get too hot. Glass or ceramic is usually a good choice, as plastic may warp or release harmful chemicals. Don't use metal or foil, as they can spark a fire or cause uneven heating. Step 2: Measure the amount of honey you want to microwave. Remember that honey can expand when heated, so leave some space in the container to avoid spillage. A few tablespoons at a time should be enough for most recipes. Step 3: Place the container with the honey in the microwave. Set the power to medium or 50%, as high heat can cause the honey to boil, scorch, or lose its beneficial enzymes. Heating honey too much can also create a carcinogenic byproduct called hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Step 4: Heat the honey for about 30 seconds, or until it's runny enough to pour or mix with other ingredients. Be careful not to overheat it, as this can cause hot spots or steam that can burn your skin. If your honey hasn't melted yet, you can microwave it for another 10-15 seconds, but keep an eye on it. Step 5: Stir the honey gently to distribute the heat and prevent clumping. Honey can crystallize or form a hard layer on top if it's not stirred frequently. You can also add some lemon juice or warm water to help dissolve any lumps. Step 6: Store the melted honey at room temperature or in the fridge, depending on how soon you plan to use it. Honey doesn't spoil or ferment easily, but it can attract moisture or bacteria if left in a damp or open place. Make sure the lid is tight and clean. Microwaving honey is a simple and quick way to enjoy its natural sweetness and health benefits. Just remember to take the necessary precautions to avoid damaging this precious nectar.

Look no further than toasted slices of baguette. This simple base is the perfect canvas for a wide variety of toppings and flavor combinations that are sure to please any palate. To begin, start by preparing some toasted slices of baguette. Toasting the bread will give it a nice crunch and help it hold up to the toppings.

For a simple yet flavorful option, try seasoning your bread with a mixture of garlic, olive oil, and salt. This seasoning will add a subtle kick of flavor that pairs well with a variety of toppings. If you're looking for a savory-sweet combination, try a gorgonzola-honey topping. The sharp tanginess of the gorgonzola is perfectly balanced with the sweetness of the honey. Another savory-sweet topping option is to use ricotta cheese and marmalade. The creamy ricotta cheese is delicious when paired with the citrusy sweetness of the marmalade. For a classic combination, try topping your bread with salmon and cream cheese. The rich creaminess of the cheese complements the subtle smokiness of the salmon perfectly.
