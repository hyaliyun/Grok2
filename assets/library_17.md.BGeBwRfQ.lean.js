Its metaphysics includes the concept of māyā and ātman. Māyā connotes that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal. The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be.

They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. Jīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Selfknowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.

The mother-of-two was accused of leaving her potential suitors humiliated, miserable, and deep in debt. The judge presiding over the case described her actions as deceitful and said that her victims had suffered significantly due to her dishonesty. Despite the severity of the crime, Fatima escaped jail time and was given only a 12-month suspended sentence. Her husband, Raja Haider Ali, 45, was also implicated in the case. He was accused of threatening those who asked for their money back, claiming that he had already murdered 20 people in Pakistan. The court heard how Ali had used intimidation tactics to keep the men quiet and to prevent them from taking legal action against his wife. The case has highlighted the scourge of fraud and deception in modern-day relationships. The rise of online dating and social media platforms has made it easier for individuals to create fake identities and to exploit vulnerable people for financial gain. It is not uncommon for people to pretend to be someone they are not, using fake names, photographs, and even entire backstories to trick others into falling for them. The case of Sidra Fatima is a stark reminder of the dangers of online dating and the importance of being vigilant when entering into relationships. It is essential to verify the identity of the person you are communicating with, to conduct thorough background checks, and to trust your instincts when something seems too good to be true.

However, the plan has received criticism from some quarters, including the Liberal Democrats and certain civil servants.

Supporters of the plan argue that the creation of these free schools will help to drive up educational standards across the country, providing more choice and diversity for students and their families. However, critics argue that this approach takes funding away from existing schools, and that it may not be the best way to address the systemic issues faced by the education system. They also point out that many free schools have struggled to attract enough students or to maintain consistent academic performance. Ultimately, the success of this plan will depend on a number of factors, including the quality of the schools established, the extent to which they are able to attract talented teachers and support staff, and the willingness of local communities to embrace them.

Place your club horizontally in the vice somewhere in the middle and lock it in. This will help keep the club stable while you clean.

Use a soft-bristled brush and warm, soapy water to gently scrub the surface. Be careful not to get water inside the grip, as this can damage it. Once you're finished scrubbing, rinse the club with clean water and dry it off with a towel. It's important to note that different types of grips may require different cleaning methods.

This broke the previous record of 63-yards, which was held by Tom Dempsey, Jason Elam, and Sebastian Janikowski.

Her mother Kate has accused the phone company of 'extortion'","output":"Casey Snook, a 14-year old teenager, recently uploaded photos on Facebook of her trip to New York, unaware that the activity would leave her father with a massive phone bill charge. According to Orange, the teenager ran up the charges by using data roaming. Data roaming is a service which enables users to use the Internet abroad without using their home data plan. Unfortunately, the service has the downside of expensive roaming fees which Casey's father was not aware of. As a result of this incident, Casey's mother, Kate, has accused the phone company of extortion. Although Casey may not have been aware of the high fees of data roaming, Orange is now in the hot seat for not properly communicating with customers about the potential cost implications of such a service. It is essential that telecommunication providers clearly communicate any associated expenses of using their services abroad. Customers should be provided with a clear understanding of the cost structure, charges, mileage for billing, and how to limit the overall expenses. There are several ways that customers can potentially avoid expensive phone bills while traveling overseas. One is to purchase a pre-paid international data plan before the trip. This plan will provide a reasonable amount of data and text messages, without the worry of going beyond limits. Another is to use wireless Internet as much as possible. Public Wi-Fi is relatively cheap, and its use is easy to monitor. Moreover, it is essential to check the roaming charges of a specific country before leaving home and consider turning off some applications that we don’t require when traveling but which might accrue data usage unknowingly. In conclusion, Casey Snook's situation is a cautionary tale to those who take their phones abroad. Orange, like other phone companies, should communicate the risks and cost implications of their international services. In the end, the solution lies in the hands of the customers. Checking the cost structure of phone plans and options for overseas travel is crucial. While it's convenient to stay connected while travelling, it's important to monitor our usage and be vigilant about the costs that come with such services."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = The Golden Curry, food = Fast food, familyFriendly = no.

One way to achieve this is to include lean protein at every meal. This macronutrient not only supports weight loss, but also helps build and repair muscles. Another key factor in a healthy diet is incorporating a variety of fruits and vegetables. These foods are packed with essential vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber to keep you feeling full and satisfied. Building your meals and snacks around these nutrient-dense options can help keep you on track and prevent overeating. When it comes to carbohydrates, it's important to choose wisely. 100% whole grains are a great option, as they provide important nutrients and fiber. However, it's best to avoid refined or processed grains, which can cause blood sugar spikes and leave you feeling hungry soon after eating. Hydration is also crucial for weight loss. Not only does water help flush out toxins and support bodily functions, but it can also help manage hunger. Sometimes when we feel hungry, we are actually just thirsty. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help control cravings and prevent overeating. Lastly, it's important to monitor your caloric intake. Cutting 500-750 calories per day can result in safe and sustainable weight loss. By counting your calories and being mindful of portion sizes, you can be sure you are staying within your daily goal.

Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group.

The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered nullhomotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole).

Try new things. Listen to music. Use acronyms.","output":"Memory is a crucial aspect of our lives. It allows us to remember important information, recognize faces, and recall past experiences. However, sometimes we struggle to remember certain things, such as a new person's name or a phone number. Fortunately, there are various techniques that you can use to improve your memory. One effective technique is memory association. This involves building off of things that you already know and remember. For example, if you need to remember a new person's name, you could associate it with someone else you know who has the same name or with a memorable characteristic of the person. This can help make the new information more memorable and easier to recall. Visualization is another useful memory technique. By creating a mental image of something, you are more likely to remember it. For example, if you are trying to remember to pick up eggs from the grocery store, you could visualize a carton of eggs sitting on your kitchen counter. This creates a vivid image in your mind that you can recall later. Repetition is another powerful memory tool. By repeating information multiple times, you can help solidify it in your memory. For example, if you are trying to memorize a list of items, you could repeat them several times in your head or write them down multiple times. Trying new things is also beneficial for improving memory. By challenging your brain with new experiences, you are creating new neural pathways that improve cognitive function. This could be as simple as taking a different route to work or learning a new hobby. Listening to music is another technique that can enhance memory. Studies have shown that listening to certain types of music can improve focus and concentration, which can make it easier to remember information. Finally, acronyms are an excellent way to simplify complex information. By creating an acronym, you can remember a longer list of items or ideas more easily. For example, in order to remember the order of the planets in our solar system, you could use the acronym MVEMJSUN (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). In conclusion, memory can be improved through a variety of techniques, including memory association, visualization, repetition, trying new things, listening to music, and using acronyms. By incorporating these strategies into your daily life, you can enhance your memory and recall important information more easily."},{"instruction":"it true that is the xbox one backwards compatible with xbox 360 based on the following text?

The result is 16, meaning that Peyton Manning's longest touchdown pass was 16 yards longer than Tony Romo's. It's worth noting, however, that comparing the length of two individual touchdown passes does not necessarily provide a complete picture of the quarterbacks' respective abilities. There are a multitude of factors that contribute to a quarterback's success, and it would be unfair to make a definitive judgement based on just one or two plays."},{"instruction":"What is an example of a tweet?","output":"\\"Just finished reading an amazing book!

In the said interview, the then US President, Barack Obama refused to acknowledge the incident as a terrorist attack. This statement is contradictory to his earlier and later claims where he has mentioned that he was aware of the fact that the attack was terrorism. The CBS interview was never released earlier and it has created a stir ever since it has been made public. Critics have pointed out that his statement in the interview is in contrast to what he said in his address to the nation on September 12, 2012. In his address, Obama had referred to the Benghazi incident as an “outrageous and shocking attack” and “act of terror”. The Benghazi attack took place on September 11, 2012, and led to the death of four Americans, including the US ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens. It was reported that the attack was carried out by Islamic militants and was a pre-planned act of terrorism. However, in the CBS interview, Obama refused to refer to it as a terrorist attack. The recent release of the interview has fueled the debate surrounding the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration’s response to it. Critics have alleged that the administration was not prepared for such an attack and did not take adequate measures to ensure the safety of the American personnel in Libya. In conclusion, the recent release of the CBS interview has once again brought the Benghazi incident into the spotlight. Obama’s statement in the interview contradicts with his earlier and later claims that he was aware of the fact that the attack was terrorism. It has led to renewed criticism of the Obama administration’s response to the attack and raised questions about their preparedness for such incidents."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Blanket your horse.","output":"Clipping Your Horse: A Simple Guide Clipping your horse can be a tricky task, but with these simple steps, you can ensure that your horse is properly groomed for any occasion. Follow these instructions to provide your horse with a clean and professional-looking coat. Start in a non-sensitive area. The best place to begin clipping your horse is in a non-sensitive area, like the neck or the shoulder. Start clipping in the direction of hair growth and move steadily along the horse's body. Begin clipping. Once you've clipped a small section, continue clipping out strips. This helps to create an even appearance and can prevent the coat from appearing patchy. Be sure to go slowly, and don't apply too much pressure. Be careful around the mane and tail. The mane and tail are sensitive areas, and it's important to be extra careful when clipping around them. Use the clippers in a downward motion when clipping the mane, and try to avoid trimming the tail as much as possible. Clip the face last. Clipping your horse's face can be the most intimidating part of the process. Start by clipping the long hairs between the horse's eyes, and then proceed to the rest of the face. Be sure to use a smaller blade and take your time, being extra careful around the eyes. Trim any remaining hairs. Once you've finished clipping your horse, there may be some stray hairs or unclipped areas. Use scissors to trim any remaining hairs and ensure that the coat appears even. Clean up the hair. Clipping generates a significant amount of hair, so it's important to clean it up thoroughly. Use a curry comb and brush to remove any loose hairs and debris. Blanket your horse. Clipping your horse's coat can leave them more susceptible to the cold. After you've cleaned up the clipped hairs, be sure to blanket your horse to keep them warm and comfortable. By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your horse looks and feels its best after being clipped. Take it slow, be careful, and enjoy the bonding experience that can come from grooming your horse."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Robert Reid: Steven Slater's dramatic exit from plane (and job) was vicarious thrill for many.

If the brightness of the light is multiplied by a factor and the exposure of the film decreased by the same factor by varying the camera's shutter speed and aperture, so that the energy received is the same, the film will be developed to the same density. This rule is called reciprocity. The systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds.

Furedi: The executioner in the video appeared to have a London accent. Furedi: Many radical British Muslims reject, loathe cultural values of British society. Furedi: British leaders failed to define common purpose that can unite all parts of society.","output":"The recent release of a video by ISIS showing the brutal and senseless beheading of journalist James Foley shocked the world. However, what made this video stand out was the apparent London accent of the executioner. This has led to discussions about the radicalization of British Muslims and their rejection of British cultural values. According to sociologist Frank Furedi, many radical British Muslims reject and loathe the cultural values of British society. Furedi argues that this rejection is not based on religious differences but on a deeper sense of disaffection with British society. Some British Muslims feel disillusioned with the lack of opportunities to fully integrate into society, and others feel that British society discriminates against them. Furthermore, Furedi contends that British leaders have failed to define a common purpose that can unite all parts of society. This failure has allowed radicalization to grow, and the broader society is now paying the price. The lack of a common purpose has also contributed to the sense of disaffection among some British Muslims, making them more susceptible to extremist ideologies. In conclusion, the horrific events surrounding James Foley's death have highlighted the issues of radicalization and disaffection within British society. The apparent involvement of a British citizen in such a heinous act has shocked the country, but it is important to understand the underlying issues that led to this event. We must address these issues head-on, and leaders must work to define a common purpose that unites all members of society, regardless of their background or beliefs."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise The executive is responsible for ensuring that program integrity initiatives and policies are implemented, assessed through an effective internal control process, and adjusted as necessary to achieve appropriate results., can we conclude the hypothesis The executive has no responsibility for the implementation of policies. is true?

Amazon is planning to open a second headquarters, and has narrowed the location down to 20 cities in the US and Canada. (The latest building at Amazon headquarters is a rainforest conservatory.)

FEMA workers complain they have difficulty reaching Sandy storm victims, he says.","output":"In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who headed up the military response in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, questioned why New York had ignored the lessons learned from Katrina. In particular, he criticized the lack of a centralized command center in the wake of the disaster, with nobody clearly in charge of the recovery effort. Honoré noted that after Katrina, the National Guard was out in force and a hospital ship was available to provide medical care to those in need. In contrast, he saw no such presence during the Sandy recovery effort. Additionally, he cited complaints from FEMA workers who were struggling to reach storm victims and provide them with assistance. Honoré's comments highlight the importance of having a clear and coordinated response to a natural disaster. Without a central command center, it can be difficult to ensure that relief efforts are reaching those who need them most. The presence of the National Guard and other military resources can also be critical in providing assistance and support to affected communities. While New York may have learned some lessons from Katrina, Honoré's comments suggest that there is still much work to be done in terms of disaster preparedness and response. Moving forward, it will be essential to take these insights into account and to develop a more effective and coordinated approach to disaster relief. Only then can we hope to mitigate the devastating effects of natural disasters and ensure that those in need receive the support and assistance they require."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: Nasser made Egypt fully independent of British influence, and the country became a major power in the developing world under his leadership.

One such tool is an alphabet chart that can be downloaded and printed out for personal practice. When beginning to learn, it is best to start with the letters that look similar to their Latin counterparts. These letters can provide a solid foundation to build from. Once these letters have been mastered, the next step is to add the three Bulgarian vowels. This will increase familiarity with the language and enhance one's ability to read and pronounce words correctly.

However, before taping your toes, it's important to determine if it's appropriate for your specific situation. Consulting with a healthcare professional is recommended to ensure that taping won't make your condition worse or delay proper treatment. Assuming taping is appropriate, the first step is to clean your feet and toes thoroughly. This will help prevent any infections or skin irritation that can occur from dirt, sweat, or oils on the skin. It's best to use mild soap and warm water and dry your feet completely before proceeding. Next, place some gauze or felt between your pinky and fourth toes. This can help reduce friction and rubbing, which is often the cause of blisters, corns, or calluses between the toes. Make sure to use soft materials to avoid any discomfort. After placing the gauze, tape your pinky and fourth toes together using medical tape. This can help support the foot's arch and reduce stress on the toes or joints in the foot. It's important not to tape the toes too tightly, as this can affect blood circulation or cause discomfort. Finally, change the gauze and tape daily. This will help prevent any buildup of bacteria or moisture, which can cause infections or skin irritation. It's also a good idea to check your toes regularly, looking for any signs of irritation, blisters, or soreness. In conclusion, taping your toes can be a helpful solution for reducing pain or discomfort caused by various foot conditions. However, it's important to determine if taping is appropriate for your specific situation and to consult with a healthcare professional.

The company has a reputation for taking a lighthearted approach to the often-serious business of space travel, and this latest move is just one example of their playful spirit. Aside from the cheese, the Dragon capsule made history by becoming the first commercial spacecraft to be recovered from Earth orbit. The capsule was successfully retrieved by SpaceX's recovery team in the Pacific Ocean, marking a major milestone for the company and for the future of commercial space travel.

Essentially, it should address a gap in the market that existing apps have not yet filled. Next, focus on usability. The app should be easy to navigate and user-friendly.

It is important to assemble a team that has the skills and expertise necessary to create a successful app. Don't forget to test the app for bugs once it is developed. This should be done through a rigorous testing process to ensure that the app functions as intended and does not have any glitches that could cause frustration for users. Once the app has been tested and is functioning properly, it is important to convert it to other platforms to reach a wider audience. This may include making the app available for iOS, Android, and web platforms. Finally, it can be useful to apply for internships to gain experience and further hone one's skills.

The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell's death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect good bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria.

With just a few simple steps, you can whip up a delicious batch of vanilla syrup that's perfect for adding extra sweetness to coffee, tea, pancakes, waffles, and more. To get started, gather the following ingredients: - 1 cup of granulated sugar - 1 cup of water - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract Once you have your ingredients prepped, grab a medium-sized saucepan and begin by combining the sugar and water inside. Give the mixture a good stir, ensuring that all of the sugar is fully dissolved before moving on. Next, turn your stove burner to high heat and bring the saucepan to a boil. Once the mixture has started to boil, reduce the stove heat to medium-low and let the syrup simmer for about 10-15 minutes. This allows the syrup to thicken up somewhat, giving it a rich and smooth consistency. While the syrup is simmering, you can add your teaspoon of vanilla extract into the mix. Once the syrup has thickened to your desired consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool down for a few minutes. Once the syrup has cooled down a bit, you can then transfer it to a glass jar or bottle for storage. Remember to let the syrup cool down completely before storing to prevent condensation from forming and spoiling the syrup. Now that you have your homemade vanilla syrup ready, you can add it to your favorite drinks or desserts for an extra touch of sweetness. Try adding it to some sparkling water for a refreshing vanilla soda or drizzle it over some vanilla ice cream for a decadent dessert.
