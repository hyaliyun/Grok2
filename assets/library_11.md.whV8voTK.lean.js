In order to answer the question of how many yards Julio Jones has on touchdown receptions, we must look at his career stats. As of the end of the 2020 NFL season, Julio Jones has made a total of 60 touchdown receptions over his career. However, the number of yards he gained on each of those touchdowns varies. To get an accurate answer to this question, we must analyze each touchdown reception individually. Unfortunately, this task would be quite time-consuming and arduous, as there are many touchdowns to review over the course of Jones' career. Fortunately, the NFL keeps overall career statistics for players that include the total number of receiving yards they have accumulated. Julio Jones has amassed an impressive 12,896 receiving yards over his career. While we cannot accurately determine the number of yards Jones has on touchdown receptions without reviewing each reception individually, we can assume that a significant portion of his receiving yards came from touchdown receptions. Therefore, we can conclude that Julio Jones has gained a substantial number of yards on touchdown receptions over his career."},{"instruction":"Question: Whose troops threatened reprisals in Valencia?

White offenders typically use powder cocaine, which carries a much lower minimum prison term. Mandatory minimum laws were launched during the 1980s 'War on Drugs' but federal prisons are now 40 per cent over capacity.","output":"The impact of mandatory minimum prison terms on black offenders who use, purchase or sell crack cocaine is alarming. These laws were established during the 1980s 'War on Drugs', but the overrepresentation of black offenders has raised concerns over the fairness and effectiveness of this approach. White offenders are more likely to use powder cocaine, which carries a significantly lower minimum prison term. This further emphasizes the racial disparities within the justice system, as black offenders are already subject to harsher sentences for similar crimes. However, the issue is not just about racial discrimination but also the effectiveness of mandatory minimum laws. Despite their inception to combat drug-related crimes, federal prisons are now 40% over capacity. This has raised questions over whether a focus on incarceration is the best way to address drug-related issues. It is important to re-evaluate the impact of mandatory minimum laws on communities of color and the justice system as a whole. Alternative approaches, such as diversion programs or increased access to rehabilitation, may prove to be more effective in addressing drug addiction and reducing recidivism rates. In conclusion, the overrepresentation of black offenders in mandatory minimum prison terms for drug-related offenses is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. Reforms in the justice system, along with alternative approaches to drug addiction and rehabilitation, may offer a more effective way forward."},{"instruction":"What are the ways to compete in the Olympics in 2020?

But what do you do when you have an abundant crop of chives? Here are some easy ways to gather and store chives. First, gather the leaves into a bunch. If you have tall chives, you can use a pair of scissors to cut them about an inch above the soil. If your chives are shorter, gather them at the base and gently twist them off. Make sure you don't damage the bulb, as chives will regrow from the bulb. Once you have a bunch of chives, you can use them fresh or dry them for later use. To dry chives, tie the bunch together with a string and hang upside down in a cool, dry place for a week or two. Once the leaves are dry, you can crumble them by hand or cut them into small pieces with a pair of scissors. Store the dried chives in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If you prefer to use fresh chives, you can store them in the fridge. Place the bunch of chives in a plastic bag or wrap them in a damp paper towel and store in the crisper drawer. Fresh chives can last for up to a week when stored properly. Finally, don't be afraid to use your chives in a recipe. Chives can add flavor to soups, salads, dips, and more. Try adding them to a baked potato, scrambled eggs, or sprinkling them over grilled fish or chicken. Chives can also be used in homemade herb butter or a classic French omelet. In conclusion, gathering and storing chives is easy and rewarding. Whether you prefer fresh or dried chives, this versatile herb is an excellent addition to any pantry or garden. So, next time you harvest a bunch of chives, store them for later use or try them in a simple recipe."},{"instruction":"These are connected in a daisy chain, with the data in of the first LED sourced by a microprocessor, which can control the brightness and color of each LED independently of the others. a good answer to the question What object sources the data in of the first LED of a digital rgb LED?

Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone.

Chairman Levy believed to be already sounding out replacements. VillasBoas tells Spurs fans that he's to blame for 50 thrashing.","output":"Tottenham Hotspur, one of the leading clubs in the English Premier League, is in a state of flux. With their recent 5-0 drubbing against a rampant Liverpool side, the pressure on manager Andre Villas-Boas has been rising. The Portuguese has accepted full responsibility for the loss, but that hasn't stopped rumors of his sacking from gaining traction. Among the names being touted as possible replacements are Fabio Capello, Guus Hiddink, and Glenn Hoddle. Capello, a former manager of the England national team, has an impressive record of honours at various clubs. Hiddink, a Dutchman, had two spells as caretaker manager for Chelsea, leading them to an FA Cup win in 2009. Hoddle, a former Spurs player, has already managed the club in the past with moderate success. It has been rumoured that Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, has been sounding out potential replacements for Villas-Boas. Levy has a reputation for being trigger-happy with the dismissal of managers, having previously dispensed with the services of Andre Villas-Boas's predecessor, Harry Redknapp. However, despite the rumours, Villas-Boas remains in charge of Spurs for the time being. Following the humiliating defeat to Liverpool, he addressed the club's fans and took responsibility for the loss. Villas-Boas stated that he had made tactical and personnel errors that contributed to the heavy defeat. The Portuguese is hoping to rally his troops and rebuild confidence ahead of some important upcoming fixtures. In conclusion, while Tottenham Hotspur currently finds itself in a difficult position, it is unclear whether the club will make any immediate changes to its managerial personnel.

Use muscle memory to trigger teary eyes. Assume a tearyeyed persona. Find your power phrase. Think about sad music.","output":"When we imagine sad things, it can often be difficult to tap into the emotions that accompany them. But by utilizing muscle memory, we can trigger our bodies to respond with teary eyes and a deeper connection to the sadness we feel. To start, find a quiet and comfortable place to sit. Close your eyes and begin to think of something that makes you feel sad. As you do this, focus on the physical sensations that accompany this emotion. Do you feel a heaviness in your chest? A tightness in your throat? Make note of these sensations. Next, think of a movement or gesture that you associate with sadness. Perhaps it's a slow, deliberate blink or a trembling lip. Practice this movement several times until it becomes ingrained in your muscle memory. Now, assume a teary-eyed persona. Allow your face to mirror the emotions you are feeling inside. Picture yourself as an actor in a movie or play, fully embodying the character and their sorrow. Use your muscle memory technique to enhance this visualization, and soon you may find real tears falling from your eyes. To take this exercise even further, find your power phrase. This is a short statement or mantra that helps you tap into the emotions you're feeling. For example, \\"I am allowed to feel this sadness,\\" or \\"This too shall pass.\\" Repeat this phrase to yourself as you work through the muscle memory exercises. Finally, consider incorporating sad music into the exercise. Music has the ability to tap into our emotions and enhance our feelings. Choose a song or instrumental piece that resonates with you and listen to it as you work through the muscle memory techniques. Remember, it's okay to feel sadness and to explore these emotions in a healthy way. By utilizing muscle memory, assuming a teary-eyed persona, finding your power phrase, and listening to sad music, you can better connect with and understand the depth of your emotions."},{"instruction":"the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? is its reliance on formula OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"The sentiment of the following sentence is negative."},{"instruction":"Anyway , he 's very sweet and also kind of quiet and shy .

It's also good for your heart, thanks to its low levels of saturated fat. The American Heart Association recommends that people eat fish at least twice a week.","output":"Mercury from fish has long been a concern for both environmental and public health advocates. Recently, a study was conducted to determine whether this heavy metal, which is known to cause cognitive and developmental problems in children, might also affect the heart health of adults. The study's results could have important implications for dietary recommendations related to the consumption of fish. However, it's worth noting that fish is generally considered a healthy food choice. It is low in saturated fat, making it a good option for those looking to maintain a healthy heart. In fact, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that people eat fish at least twice a week as part of a heart-healthy diet. Despite the benefits of fish, concerns about mercury in fish have persisted. Some types of fish are known to contain higher levels of mercury than others, particularly larger predator fish such as shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. For this reason, the AHA advises people to choose fish lower in mercury, such as salmon, sardines, and trout. The recent study on mercury and heart health is an important addition to the conversation about fish consumption. While researchers are still analyzing the data, the results could have implications for dietary guidelines related to fish. It's possible that recommendations related to the types and amounts of fish people should be eating will change if the study finds a significant link between mercury exposure and heart disease. Ultimately, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between mercury from fish and heart health. In the meantime, the AHA's advice to eat fish twice a week can still be followed with confidence, so long as consumers opt for fish that is lower in mercury."},{"instruction":"What happens next in this paragraph?

He has played for the Baltimore Ravens throughout his entire career, and he is known for his accuracy and ability to make clutch kicks in critical situations. To answer the question of how many field goals Tucker has kicked, we must first look at his career statistics. Since making his debut in 2012, Tucker has attempted 265 field goals, making 237 of them. That gives him a career field goal percentage of 89.4%, which is excellent by any standard. Tucker has been especially consistent in recent years, making at least 90% of his field goal attempts in each of the past four seasons. In fact, his 2019 season was arguably the best of his career, as he made all 28 of his field goal attempts and all 57 of his extra point attempts. One thing that sets Tucker apart from other kickers is his ability to make long field goals. Throughout his career, he has made 17 field goals of 50 yards or more, including a career-long 61-yarder in 2013. He also made a game-winning 49-yard field goal in overtime of a playoff game against the Denver Broncos in 2013, which is widely considered one of the greatest kicks in NFL history. In addition to his success as a field goal kicker, Tucker is also a reliable kickoff specialist. He has consistently ranked among the league leaders in touchback percentage, meaning he frequently kicks the ball deep into the end zone and prevents opposing teams from returning it for a big gain. In conclusion, Tucker is one of the most talented and consistent kickers in the NFL today. He has made 237 field goals throughout his career, and his accuracy, range, and composure make him a valuable asset to any team."},{"instruction":"Write an email with the following subject: FYI: Financial swaps and options with Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources Inc.","output":"Subject: Financial swaps and options with Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources Inc.

Nikola Zrinski, a Croatian nobleman, and military commander in the 17th century, is known for his heroic resistance against the Ottoman Empire. He played a key role in the Battle of Szigetvar in 1566, where he fought against a huge Ottoman army led by Suleiman the Magnificent. Later, in 1664, Zrinski was appointed as the supreme commander of the Croatian-Slavonian military frontier. In 1664, the Ottoman Empire was weakened by its ongoing war with the Austrian Habsburg Empire. Zrinski saw this as an opportunity to drive the Ottomans out of Hungary, and he launched an all-out offensive against them. He decided to attack Nagykanizsa, an important Ottoman garrison town in southwestern Hungary. Zrinski knew that the Ottomans would try to reinforce the garrison at Nagykanizsa by bringing troops and supplies across the river Mura. To prevent this, he ordered the destruction of the bridge over the river. The destruction of the bridge was carried out by his subordinate, Petar Zrinski, while Nikola Zrinski himself led the main army towards Nagykanizsa. The destruction of the bridge proved effective, as the Ottoman reinforcements were delayed and the siege of Nagykanizsa began without any significant opposition. However, the victory was not easy. The Ottoman garrison put up fierce resistance, and the siege lasted for several months. Zrinski personally led the assault on the walls of the town, and his soldiers managed to capture several key positions. After months of fighting, the Ottomans inside Nagykanizsa realized that they could not hold out any longer. They surrendered to Zrinski, and he became the hero of the day. The victory boosted the morale of the Habsburg forces and paved the way for further advances into Ottoman territory. In conclusion, Zrinski first attempted to conquer Nagykanizsa before destroying the bridge. While both actions were crucial to his strategy, the siege and conquest of Nagykanizsa proved to be the more significant achievement.

Knowing how to use your paint sprayer can allow you to achieve a smooth and even application, but it’s important to follow some basic steps to get the best results. Here are the fundamental steps to follow when using a paint sprayer: 1. Mix Enough Paint: Make sure you have enough paint to complete your project before you begin spraying.

Romney had stated that the US had fewer warships than it did in 1916, insinuating that the country was not prepared militarily. Obama, who was seeking re-election at the time, hit back with a quip that seemed to put Romney in his place. \\"Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military has changed,\\" Obama said during the debate. This comment quickly went viral on social media and became a defining moment in the 2012 presidential campaign. Obama's comment was hailed by his supporters as a clever and effective rebuttal to Romney's argument. While Romney's assertion about warships was technically true, Obama was able to turn the conversation around and highlight the fact that military technology had advanced significantly since 1916. The US military may have fewer warships, but they are far more advanced and capable than the vessels of a century ago. Obama's comment also highlighted the importance of adapting to change and embracing new technology. The military needs to be able to keep up with advancements in technology and adapt to new threats as they emerge. This is a lesson that applies not just to the military, but to all aspects of life. In the end, Obama won the 2012 presidential election with a comfortable margin of victory. While his quip about horses and bayonets was not the sole reason for his success, it certainly played a part in shaping public perceptions of the two candidates. Overall, Obama's response to Romney's claim about warships was a brilliant display of wit and intelligence. It showed that he was not afraid to take on his opponents and that he was willing to use humor to make his point."},{"instruction":"Goal: How can you make eggs bounce?

The mandolin's popularity in the United States was spurred by the success of a group of touring young European musicians known as the Estudiantina Figaro, or in the United States, simply the Spanish Students. The group landed in the U.S. on January 2, 1880 in New York City, and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds. Ironically, this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias, which are also small, doublestrung instruments that resemble the mandolin. The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes. An Italian musician, Carlo Curti, hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the Original Spanish Students, counting on the American public to not know the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins.

Learn how the Estonia sank. Check for the location of personal flotation devices. Think about your sense of etiquette.","output":"Sinking ships are one of the most horrific incidents that could happen to anyone out at sea. Understanding how a ship sinks could help save your life in case of an emergency. Take, for example, the incident that occurred with MS Estonia. On September 28th, 1994, the Estonia, a ferry carrying 989 passengers, sank in the Baltic Sea, and sadly, only 137 people survived. According to investigations, the Estonia went down quickly because the bow visor, which acted as the front door to the car deck, broke off due to the stormy weather. The car deck floodlights failed to work, and the water got into the vehicle decks impacting the ship's stability. The ship's crew couldn't contain the flooding and had to abandon the ship. Therefore, in case of an emergency onboard, take the time to check where personal flotation devices are located. They could be the only lifesavers that you have in case of an emergency. Once you have located them, ensure that everyone near you has access to them too. Etiquette is another essential factor to observe when a ship sinks. Remain calm in case of an emergency, and follow the emergency procedures given by the crew. Avoid panic, shouting, or pushing other people. Always listen to the rescuers and prioritize physical and mental safety for yourself and others. To conclude, understanding the mechanics behind sinking ships, taking note of the location of personal flotation devices, and maintaining sensible etiquette could be the difference between life and death in case of an emergency."},{"instruction":"not having a good morning blah!!!!!

In 1858, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steelmaking by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. Mangalloy, an alloy of steel and manganese exhibiting extreme hardness and toughness, was one of the first alloy steels, and was created by Robert Hadfield in 1882.

But what if you want to take your cupcake experience to the next level? One option is to add a filling to your cupcake, such as jam or cream. This can add a burst of flavor and a new texture to the already delicious cake. But how do you go about filling a cupcake? It's actually quite simple. First, place your cupcake on a plate. Then, using a sharp knife, carefully divide the cupcake in half. You want to make sure you're cutting evenly, so that the top and bottom halves are roughly the same size. Once you have your cupcake halves, it's time to add your filling. Jam is a popular choice, but you could also use fruit compote, Nutella, peanut butter, or any other spread you like. Spoon your filling onto the bottom half of the cupcake, spreading it evenly across the surface. Now comes the fun part: putting the cupcake back together. Take the top half of the cupcake and carefully place it on top of the filling. Gently press down so that the two halves stick together, but be careful not to squish the filling out the sides. And there you have it – a delicious, filled cupcake ready to be enjoyed. You could stop there and dive right in, or you could add an extra flourish by dusting the top with powdered sugar, drizzling with chocolate sauce, or adding a dollop of whipped cream.

It can be tempting to scratch, but it is essential to resist the urge as it only damages the delicate skin around the wound, which can prolong the healing time. Instead, allow your body to do what it does best, naturally heal itself. It is also vital to keep the wound clean to prevent infection. First, gently clean the wound with soap and water before patting it dry. Avoid using harsh chemicals or rubbing the skin too hard as it can cause further irritation. Cover the wound with a clean bandage or dressing, ensuring it is changed daily. In some cases, it may be necessary to seek out medical attention. If the wound is deep or infected, it is important to visit a doctor. Symptoms of infection include pus, redness and increased pain or warmth around the wound. The doctor may prescribe antibiotics, clean the wound or suggest other treatments to prevent further complications. Ultimately, the best way to deal with a wound is to avoid picking at scabs, keeping it clean and seeking medical attention if necessary.

The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity.

However, the process of assembling and launching a kite can sometimes be daunting, especially for beginners. In order to make the process easier and more successful, it is important to follow a few simple steps. Firstly, assemble the kite indoors before taking it outside. This will save you time and frustration when you are at the flying location. Once you have your kite assembled, find a clear open space with no obstacles such as trees or buildings. The best location would be a large open field or beach. Next, stand with your back towards the wind. This is a crucial step because the wind is what provides lift to the kite. If you face the wind with the kite, it will not take off. Therefore, positioning yourself with your back towards the wind allows the kite to catch the wind and lift off. Once you are in the right position, begin walking backwards while holding the kite by the line. This causes the wind to fill the kite, creating lift and causing it to rise into the sky. It is important to walk backwards slowly and steadily, without stopping suddenly or jerking the line. Finally, once your kite is in the air, pull gently on the lines to control its direction and movements. Remember to also pay attention to the wind and make adjustments as needed to keep the kite flying. When it is time to land the kite, slowly reel in the lines until it reaches the ground. In conclusion, kite flying is a fun and rewarding activity that can be enjoyed by everyone. Remember to assemble the kite indoors, position yourself with your back towards the wind, walk backwards slowly and steadily, and control the lines gently. With these simple steps, you can launch and fly your kite with ease and have a great time doing it."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Abbott's pledge to \\"Stop the Boats\\" and reduce the number of asylum seekers entering Australia has been a prominent feature of his campaign. It appears that he plans to implement this policy without delay. In addition to this, Abbott has also stated his intention to reverse the climate change consensus. His views on climate change have always been controversial, and he has been a vocal critic of carbon taxes and renewable energy targets. This move has sparked outrage among environmentalists, who fear that Abbott's policies could lead to irreparable damage to the environment. Abbott's Right-wing agenda has been criticized by many, who see his policies as regressive and divisive. However, his supporters believe that he is the right man to lead Australia towards a more conservative future. It remains to be seen how successful Abbott's policies will be in the long run. The immigration and climate change issues are complex, and it will take more than just tough talk to achieve meaningful progress. However, Abbott's determination and conviction cannot be doubted. It is clear that he intends to move forward with his Right-wing agenda, and we can expect to see more drastic actions in the coming days."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Aromi, eatType = coffee shop, food = Italian, customer rating = average, area = city centre, familyFriendly = ye","output":"Aromi is an Italian coffee shop located in the city centre with an average customer rating and family-friendly atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many years after Richard's father died did RIchard himself die?","output":"Unfortunately, based on the given question, I cannot provide a detailed article as the information needed to answer the question is not provided.

By quickly tossing the ball to a receiver or running back near the goal line, the offense has a high probability of success.

Holding onto the past can only hinder your growth and prevent you from experiencing new opportunities. Closing a chapter means accepting the end of a particular period of your life and taking control of your future. This can be difficult, especially if you've invested a significant amount of time and energy into something or someone. However, it's necessary to understand that closing a chapter doesn't mean forgetting what happened or pretending it never occurred. Instead, it means acknowledging the experience and learning from it. Remembering your options is crucial when closing a chapter. Sometimes, it's easy to feel trapped and like there's no way out of a situation. However, it's essential to remember that there are always options available to you. This might include seeking help from friends or family, talking to a professional, or even making a fresh start in a new location. Remember, there's always a way forward, and you're never stuck in one place forever. Finally, embracing the learning experience is perhaps the most critical aspect of closing a chapter. Every experience we have teaches us something, whether it's good or bad. It's important to reflect on what you've learned and how you can apply it to your future. This can help you grow as a person, avoid repeating past mistakes, and become better equipped for any challenges that may come your way in the future.

However, it is possible to do it successfully by following a few tips. The first step is to build a friendship with the person you're interested in. This means asking her to spend time with you in a pressure-free environment, such as a coffee shop or a casual hangout spot. Once you've established a connection, consider giving her a small and inexpensive gift as a sign of your interest. This could be something as simple as a small bouquet of flowers or a book that she may enjoy. However, it's important to note that the gift should be thoughtful and not over-the-top, as it could potentially make her feel uncomfortable. After establishing a friendship and giving her a gift, it's time to have the conversation about your feelings. It's crucial to have an honest and open discussion without putting any pressure on her to respond in a particular way. Start by telling her how you feel and why you feel that way, but don't overwhelm her with too much information. Let her respond in her own time, and be sure to accept her answer calmly and respectfully. In summary, the key to expressing your feelings to someone is to build a friendship, give a thoughtful gift, and have an open and honest conversation without any pressure. By following these tips, you can increase your chances of success and potentially pave the way for a deeper connection."},{"instruction":"Next question: who took the sword out of the stone?","output":"King Arthur."},{"instruction":"Stay away from this branch!
