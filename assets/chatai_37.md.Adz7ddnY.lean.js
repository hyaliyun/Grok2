In 1715, when Charles XII first arrived in Stralsund, he had ordered the fortifications of the city to be strengthened. However, he had failed to complete the work before leaving. This oversight would eventually prove costly. In 1720, the Great Northern War, which had been going on since 1700, finally came to an end. Stralsund was one of the last cities still holding out against the victorious coalitions of Denmark and Prussia. In 1715, Stralsund had been a powerful fortress, but now it was badly damaged and undermanned. In May 1721, the city was besieged, and after several weeks of fighting, the defenders were forced to surrender. Charles XII, who had ordered the fortifications to be improved but had left before they were completed, was not there to save the city. In conclusion, Stralsund fell in 1721, which was approximately 13 years after Charles XII had returned to the city. Despite his efforts to strengthen the city's defenses, he was unable to prevent its fall. The legacy of the Great Northern War would be felt for decades to come."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Alimentum, food = Chinese, priceRange = high, area = riverside","output":"Alimentum is a high-priced Chinese restaurant located in riverside area."},{"instruction":"The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces.

To achieve this goal, the country will switch to larger mines equipped with newer machinery and increased capacity. Coal is responsible for 75 percent of China's energy use, which has led to a spike in pollution levels and increased dangers for workers in the coal mining industry. The new effort to switch to larger mines with advanced equipment will help to not only increase productivity but also greatly reduce environmental damage and improve worker safety. With the new focus on larger mines, China can achieve greater efficiencies in the coal mining process. By consolidating operations and upgrading machinery, larger mines can be more productive while reducing the number of smaller and often less efficient operations throughout the country. The move to larger mines is expected to lead to a reduction in the number of deadly accidents that occur each year in China's coal mining industry. The adoption of new equipment, along with stricter regulations, will provide a safer work environment for miners, ensuring that they are protected from the dangers of underground mining. In addition to improving worker safety, the focus on larger mines will also help to reduce the harmful environmental impacts of coal mining. By reducing the number of smaller operations, China can better control the environmental impact of coal mining, such as air and water pollution, and make strides towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy future. Overall, China's decision to switch to larger mines equipped with advanced equipment and increased capacity is a crucial step towards reducing the negative environmental and social impacts of coal mining. The increased efficiencies and improved worker safety that result from these measures will not only benefit China but serve as a model for other countries struggling with similar issues."},{"instruction":"Question: US actor Joseph Yule Jr, born September 1920, is better known by what name?

The key is to know when and where to find them, and how to store them until you can sell them for the best price. First, you'll need to plant some coconut trees in the southern part of your town. If you don't have any coconuts, wait until one washes up on your shores, or ask a friend if you can shake one from their tree. Once you have a few trees, you can start harvesting coconuts and using them to plant more trees. Next, it's time to start catching bugs. The best time to do this is late at night, after 8 or 9 PM, and preferably around 1 AM. Take a net and walk near your coconut trees, checking them for any bugs that might be crawling on the tree or flying around it. Catch as many as you can, and store them in a clear room in your house. This room will come in handy if you catch bugs after Tom Nook's shop closes, as you can store them there until the morning. Once the shop opens, take your bugs to the flea market to sell them for twice the amount you would get at Tom Nook's. Keep doing this regularly, and you'll quickly see your bell earnings increase.

The news network alleges identity theft and impersonation in relation to the interview, after a commissioned analysis showed that the two voices in question were different. Despite this, the purported resignation was also reported by Reuters, which cited the Syrian Embassy as its source. The incident highlights the challenge faced by news organizations in verifying the authenticity of sources and interviews, particularly in a context of political tension and disinformation. While the rights and responsibilities of journalists in reporting on sensitive issues must be balanced against the risks of manipulation and interference, such incidents can damage the credibility of both the media and the individuals involved. For Syria, which has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since 2011, the controversy is a reminder of the complex web of interests and actors involved in the conflict. The country has been accused of multiple human rights violations, including the use of chemical weapons and torture, while Russia and Iran have provided military support to the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The episode also raises questions about the role of diplomatic missions in the era of fake news and digital communications.

When they were sentenced last month, the boys, now 14, avoided jail due to their age. Instead, they were given electronic tags and put under curfew for three months. However, after the sentencing, a family friend of one of the boys wrote on Facebook that the victim \\"had asked for it.\\" This comment was followed by a torrent of similar remarks, with some people even blaming the girl for the attack. The victim's mother, 35, from Chepstow, south Wales, turned to the police for help. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't assist, and Facebook also claimed that the comments were acceptable. Eventually, the page was taken down when the girl's mother asked the person who had put it up to remove it. This case highlights the issue of victim-blaming and cyberbullying, which can have a devastating impact on the victim and their loved ones. No one deserves to be sexually assaulted, and it's crucial that we take a stand against all forms of victim-blaming and online abuse. Furthermore, it raises concerns about the justice system and how it handles sexual assault cases. While the boys didn't receive a custodial sentence due to their age, it's difficult to see how electronic tags and a curfew will adequately address the harm they caused. Additionally, the fact that the perpetrators and their supporters were able to post abusive comments without any consequences shows the urgent need for greater accountability on social media platforms. Overall, it's clear that more needs to be done to make sure that victims of sexual assault are protected and that those who harm them are held accountable.

When it comes to applying a brow pencil, the key is to use light and short strokes instead of heavy lines. This will help you to blend the color effectively and prevent your eyebrows from appearing too harsh or severe. If you want a more natural finish, you can also use a spoolie brush to blend and soften the lines. But what about keeping your eyebrows healthy and nourished? Well, Vaseline could be your new best friend. Applying Vaseline to your eyebrows before going to bed is a simple and effective way to moisturize and condition them. This will give them a healthy and shiny appearance, which is essential for achieving a well-groomed look. Vaseline is also an excellent eyebrow styling tool. If you have unruly eyebrows that tend to go in different directions, simply apply a small amount of Vaseline and use a spoolie brush to shape them into place. This will help to keep them looking neat and tidy throughout the day. One thing to keep in mind is that using too much Vaseline can lead to clogged pores, so it's essential to use it sparingly. A tiny bit goes a long way, so apply a thin layer of Vaseline using your fingertips or a cotton swab. In conclusion, using a brow pencil and Vaseline together is a winning combination for achieving perfectly groomed and healthy-looking eyebrows. Whether you're going for a natural or bold look, these tips will help you to maintain flawless eyebrows that will make everyone envious.

These programs can be a big help when it comes to navigating the complex world of agriculture. However, not every farmer is eligible for every program. That's why it's essential to compare the programs available and check which commodities qualify before contacting your FSA office. First, farmers should take a look at the various programs offered by the government. These programs may include crop insurance, conservation programs, and marketing assistance programs. By comparing different programs, farmers can determine which ones are the best fit for their unique circumstances. Next, it's essential to check if the crops they grow qualify for the program. Each program has different requirements, and not all crops are eligible for every program. For example, a program may only apply to crops grown on a specific type of soil or in a specific region. It’s important to thoroughly read the requirements and guidelines for each program to determine if you are eligible. Once a farmer has determined which programs they may be eligible for and which crops qualify, it's time to contact their local FSA office. The FSA (Farm Service Agency) is a government agency that provides support and resources to farmers. They can provide detailed information and assistance with the various programs available and help you complete the necessary forms and applications. In conclusion, farmers should take the time to compare the different programs available, check which crops are eligible, and contact their local FSA office for assistance.

Some flow is a normal condition both prebirth and immediately postbirth via the foramen ovale, however when this does not naturally close after birth it is referred to as a patent (open) foramen ovale (PFO). Normally, after PFO closure, the atria are separated by a dividing wall, the interatrial septum. If this septum is defective or absent, then oxygenrich blood can flow directly from the left side of the heart to mix with the oxygenpoor blood in the right side of the heart, or vice versa. This can lead to lowerthannormal oxygen levels in the arterial blood that supplies the brain, organs, and tissues. However, an ASD may not produce noticeable signs or symptoms, especially if the defect is small.

Curtis Reeves, a retired police captain, is the man responsible for this senseless act of violence. Recently, court documents were released detailing the events that led up to the shooting. Reeves had sent a text to his son, Matthew, at 1:04 pm, informing him that he was already seated in the theater. When Matthew, who is also a police officer, arrived late to the 1:20 showing, he tried to locate his father during the trailers. It was during this time that Reeves fatally shot Chad Oulson, claiming that Oulson's texting was disturbing him. According to records released on Thursday, this was not the first time Reeves had raised concerns about people texting in the theater. He had previously made a complaint to theater managers about a different texting incident. Reeves is currently on trial for second-degree murder and aggravated battery since the bullet that killed Mr. Oulson also injured his wife, Nicole Oulson. This horrific act serves as a reminder of the impact firearms can have in the hands of someone who is not in a stable mental state. Movie theaters have always been a place for people to escape their daily lives and enjoy a form of entertainment. However, tragedies such as this one remind us that we must remain vigilant and aware of our surroundings at all times.

It appears that Arius reproached Alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop. Arius's theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in Alexandrian Christianity, and his Christological views were certainly not radical at all. He embraced a subordinationist Christology which taught that Christ was the divine Son (Logos) of God, made, not begotten, heavily influenced by Alexandrian thinkers like Origen, and which was a common Christological view in Alexandria at the time. Support for Arius from powerful bishops like Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia, further illustrate how Arius's subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the Empire. Arius was subsequently excommunicated by Alexander, and he would begin to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position.","output":"Title: The Origins of the Arian Controversy."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"A movie review is an evaluation of a movie's overall quality, plot, acting, cinematography, and other elements.

These tribes, including the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, gradually took over the land and established their own kingdoms. By the 7th century, most of the Romano-British communities had been destroyed or assimilated. For several centuries after this, the island was relatively stable politically. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were often in conflict with each other, but there were no major external threats. This period is known as the Anglo-Saxon or Early Medieval period. It wasn't until the 11th century that the island became a battleground again. The invasion of William the Conqueror in 1066 marked the beginning of the Norman Conquest of England. Although the Normans were also of Germanic origin, they were from a different group (the Normans were originally Vikings who had settled in France). They had a different language, culture, and form of government, and they imposed their rule on the English in a brutal and transformative way. The Norman Conquest was a turning point in English history, both politically and culturally. It led to the adoption of French as the language of the ruling class, the construction of castles and churches in the Norman style, and the introduction of feudalism. It also marked the end of the Anglo-Saxon period and the beginning of the Middle Ages. In summary, the English communities were destroyed by Germanic tribes in the 5th century, and the island became a battleground again in the 11th century with the Norman Conquest, several centuries later."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

The files reveal that when then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher found out about the Argentinian invasion, it was the \\"worst moment\\" of her life. The files also highlight how the operation would have been disastrous had Argentina been forewarned. As Britain neared victory, US President Ronald Reagan urged Thatcher not to completely humiliate the Argentines. The Falklands War of 1982 was a pivotal moment in British history, as the country fought to maintain its sovereignty over the South Atlantic territory. The conflict marked a turning point in the relationship between Britain and the US, as the two allies found themselves at odds over how to handle the situation. Thatcher's reaction to the invasion was visceral, reflecting her deep concern for the British people and their way of life. The files suggest that the Prime Minister was deeply shaken by the events unfolding on the other side of the world. Despite the challenges, the British military was able to mount a successful operation that eventually defeated the Argentine forces. However, as the war neared its end, Reagan urged Thatcher not to completely humiliate the Argentines, suggesting that a more conciliatory approach might be better for the long-term relationship between the two countries. Taken together, these newly-revealed files provide a fascinating glimpse into one of the most important moments in modern British history. They show the complexities of managing international relationships, even among historic allies, and the deep emotions that can be stirred by acts of aggression and war."},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Exposuretoinfectedfecesofothercatsanddog","output":"Exposure to infected feces of other cats and dogs."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Giraffe eatType coffee shop; Giraffe priceRange more than £30; Giraffe customer rating 5 out of 5; Giraffe near The Baker","output":"The Giraffe coffee shop near The Bakers has a price range of more than £30 and a perfect customer rating of 5 out of 5."},{"instruction":"hecasethatyourBACfiledoesn'topen,itishighlylikelythatyoudonothavethecorrectsoftwareapplicationinstalledonyourPCtovieworeditBACfileextensions.

'We're very concerned' says surveys expert David Wembridge. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A recent survey conducted by experts has indicated a significant decline in sightings of native British mammals between 2003 and 2012. The study revealed that there has been a 37 per cent decrease in the number of sightings, which is a worrying trend that should be concerning to all who value the survival of the country's wildlife. The primary factors behind this decline are the loss of hedgerows, the increase in field sizes and the introduction of fencing, all of which are gradually erasing the natural habitats of these animals. The increase in field size means that there is less space for wildlife to roam, which can be particularly damaging to some species that require large territories to thrive. The lack of hedgerows is also having a significant impact, as these features offer vital protection and support for a variety of animals. They provide food, shelter, and an important habitat for many UK mammals. The rise in fencing is also a factor that limits and restricts the mobility of wildlife across the landscape. David Wembridge, an expert in wildlife surveys, has expressed grave concern over the findings of this study, stating that it is crucial to act now to protect the habitats of our native wildlife. Suitable measures must be taken to ensure the preservation of hedgerows and other natural features, to enable a solution to the problem and help British mammals thrive in their habitats. It's clear from the research that the decline in sightings is not just a bleak statistic, but a pressing concern that demands an active response.

He has established himself as a reliable defender in the Premier League, and his signing would bring much-needed stability to Atletico Madrid's defense. The Spanish club will now have to work quickly to secure Monreal's transfer before the transfer window closes. They will need to convince Arsenal to sell the player, and also negotiate a transfer fee that is acceptable to everyone. If the transfer goes through, Monreal will have big shoes to fill at Atletico Madrid, as Filipe Luis was a hugely popular player during his time at the club. However, Monreal's experience and quality could make him the perfect replacement, and help Atletico Madrid continue their success in La Liga and in Europe."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Cheaper crude oil prices, more plentiful supply keeps gas prices falling in the United States.

If you are considering taking iodine supplements, talk to your doctor first. They can assess your overall health and determine if iodine supplements are necessary. Taking too much iodine can lead to thyroid problems and other health issues, so it is best to be cautious. When searching for an iodine supplement, look for one that contains potassium iodide. Potassium iodide is a stable form of iodine that is well-absorbed by the body. It is often used to treat emergency radiation exposure and is available in tablet form.

The AP estimates that Mayweather will take home 180 million for one night's work, while Pacquiao's team can expect 120 million. Mayweather, whose history of domestic violence makes endorsements all but impossible, gets the bigger payday in part because of the unprecedented financial enterprise he's set up in which he acts as his own promoter, writes Annie Lowrey at New York. (The piece is headlined Floyd Mayweather's Financial Genius.) In some sense, then, Mayweather looks less like a topearning athlete than he does like a topearning touring musician—especially if you think of the payperview watchers as being ticket holders, writes Lowrey. He stages his own shows and then takes a fat cut of the revenue from those shows. In the Philippines, meanwhile, an official at an electric company is pleading with people to turn off major appliances during the fight so residents will have enough juice to watch native son Pacquiao fight for the welterweight title, reports AP.","output":"Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are set to fight tomorrow in one of the most highly anticipated pay-per-view matches of all time, with Mayweather projected to take home 180m and Pacquiao 120m for one night's work.

Mayweather is his own promoter, meaning he controls the entire process from promoting and advertising the match to revenue collection. This allows him to take a larger cut of the proceeds, like a top-earning musician. In contrast, Pacquiao will earn a large sum from the match, but his promotional fees will reduce his share significantly.

Look for brown, cut patches in your grass. Examine your turf for webs and fecal pellets. Flush out the larvae with soapy water.","output":"If you are a fan of a healthy-looking lawn, you should always watch out for any signs of damage that could harm your turf. One of the threats you should be aware of is the armyworm, a common pest that feeds on grass blades and is known to cause significant damage to large areas of the lawn. To identify an armyworm infestation on your lawn, you can use several indicators to recognize the threat. First, watch out for pale-brown moths that fly around at dusk. These moths deposit their eggs on blades of grass, which later hatch and result in armyworm larvae. So, if you spot any of these moths fluttering around your lawn, it would be wise to keep an eye out for other signs of an armyworm infestation. Another sign to look for is cut patches in your grass. Armyworms feed primarily on blades of grass, so as they make their way through your lawn, they typically leave behind small patches of grass that have been cut down to the soil. If you start to see these brown, cut patches scattered throughout your lawn, then it may be time to take action. In addition, examine your turf for webs and fecal pellets. Armyworms tend to spin webs in the grass, and you might detect a coating of webbing over small patches of lawn. Also, armyworms leave behind small green or black fecal pellets as they feed, which can accumulate in high numbers in affected areas. Lastly, to get rid of armyworms, one common approach is to flush out the larvae with soapy water. Directing a solution of dish soap mixed with water towards the affected patches can often have a significant impact, making the armyworms easier to locate and eradicate. In conclusion, recognizing signs of an armyworm infestation on your lawn, such as moths, cut patches, webbing, and fecal pellets is crucial to taking swift and effective action. With adequate attention and maintenance, though, your lawn can stay lush, green, and healthy."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was the longest field goal?","output":"The longest field goal in NFL history was kicked by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos on December 8, 2013.

A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

However, the resulting resistive impedance achieved will be quite a bit lower than the impedance of a resonant monopole, likely requiring further impedance matching. In addition to a lower radiation resistance, the reactance becomes higher as the antenna size is reduced, and the resonant circuit formed by the antenna and the tuning coil has a Q factor that rises and eventually causes the bandwidth of the antenna to be inadequate for the signal being transmitted.

The couple is currently embroiled in a bitter legal dispute over financial support and custody of their children. Dias's demands for monthly expenses have caused quite a stir: 6,800 for groceries, 7,200 for restaurant meals, and 8,000 for gifts. It is important to note that Griffin's net worth is estimated to be around 5 billion. Dias has already received 35 million in divorce settlement, but she wants sole custody of their children. On the other hand, Griffin has requested joint custody of their children. While financial support is important in any divorce settlement, it is critical that the well-being of the children is taken into account. Joint custody can be beneficial for children, as it allows both parents to be involved in their lives and ensures that they have a stable and healthy upbringing. The case has sparked a debate about divorce settlements and the amount of money that should be awarded to each party. While it is common for wealthy individuals to pay a large settlement amount, Dias's demands for monthly expenses have raised questions about fair and reasonable divorce settlements. Overall, the divorce between Ken Griffin and Anne Dias is a complex and multifaceted issue. While financial support is necessary, it is crucial that the children's welfare is the top priority in any divorce settlement. Hopefully, the couple can come to an amicable agreement that is in the best interests of their children."},{"instruction":"Moncler Men Coat Navy Blue SingleBreasted,Moncler a clothing sensation beginning in the fashion capital of the world, France.

Selective breeding for fast growth, egglaying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises.

This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called back electromotive force (emf). The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say unanswerable): EMP is proportional to what?","output":"The back electromotive force (EMF) is proportional to the running speed of the DC motor."},{"instruction":"Math problem: Solve 3*p = 6*p for p.
