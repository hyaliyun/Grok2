Unfortunately, recent incidents involving John Terry and Luis Suarez have brought the issue of racism to the forefront of the sport once again. Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during a 2011 match between Chelsea and QPR. Despite being cleared of criminal charges, Terry was found guilty by the Football Association and received a four-match ban and a £220,000 fine. Similarly, Suarez was accused of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a 2011 match between Liverpool and Manchester United. Suarez was found guilty by the FA and received an eight-match ban and a £40,000 fine. While these incidents occurred almost a decade ago, they continue to have an impact on the sport. Football pundit, and former player, Ian Wright recently highlighted the issue during an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live. Wright, who has been vocal about his own experiences with racism both on and off the pitch, called on football clubs to do more to tackle the issue. He suggested that education and awareness programs, as well as stronger punishments for those found guilty of racist behavior, could help to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment within the sport. Wright also pointed out that incidents of racism are not limited to players on the pitch. Fans have also been guilty of racist behavior during matches, which can have a devastating impact on players and fans alike. It is clear that more needs to be done to address the issue of racism in football. While the punishments handed out to Terry and Suarez were a step in the right direction, we must do more to ensure that football is a safe and inclusive sport for all. Education, awareness, and stronger punishments for those found guilty of racist behavior are just a few of the steps we can take to create a better future for the sport."},{"instruction":"What concepts are described in the following sentence?

For beginners, the first step in this journey is to begin with the alphabet. The alphabet is a set of letters used to write language. It is important for beginners to become familiar with the order of the letters to form words. Once the alphabet is known, the next step is to distinguish vowels from consonants. Vowels are letters that produce a sound with an open vocal tract, such as a, e, i, o, and u. Consonants, on the other hand, produce sound with a restricted vocal tract. There are 21 consonants in the English language, including b, c, d, f, and so on. Using phonics is another useful technique for learning to read and write. Phonics is the method of teaching reading that focuses on the sound relationships between letters and words. By using phonics, children can recognize letter sounds, blend them together to form words, and read with greater ease. Finally, recognizing punctuation marks is essential in good writing. Punctuation marks such as periods, commas, exclamation marks, and question marks help to convey meaning, tone, and inflection. Without them, writing can be confusing and difficult to understand. In conclusion, learning to read and write begins with the alphabet, distinguishing vowels from consonants, using phonics and recognizing punctuation marks. These basic steps are essential for beginners and can help set them on the path to success in reading and writing."},{"instruction":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: GensedirektealletvudsendelserafDatinginthedark2her.SeDatinginthedark2viaProgrammer.nu.Datinginthedark2erettvprogramfra.","output":"Gense direkte alle tv-udsendelser af Dating in the dark 2 her.

The pretense of the meeting was for a fake film deal, however, Taylor was allegedly raped and abused for hours. The police were called when neighbours reported a woman jumping out of a fourth-floor flat window. The victim of this abuse had suffered two broken legs and was rushed to the hospital. According to her press statement, she \\"managed to get through to the balcony and cry out for help. Rather than let her leave, the abusers took away her phone and started to beat her up”. As a 22-year-old, the Russian woman was likely eager to break into the adult film industry. Unfortunately, this situation highlights the dangers women who aspire or participate in the porn industry often face. It is not uncommon for adult performers to encounter dangerous or abusive situations in their line of work. This event highlights the need for better regulation, education, and resources for adult performers. While sex work is illegal in Russia, in some countries, it is legal and supported as a legitimate form of employment. Regardless of the legal status, the safety and wellbeing of performers is paramount. The adult industry is still struggling with these issues globally, and this event brings the need for reform to the forefront. It is essential to acknowledge that sex workers are still individuals with human rights and boundaries that must be respected. The horrific events that happened to Taylor serve as a reminder that there is still work to be done to protect people within the industry. It is a painful example of how people may take advantage of those who are vulnerable and perpetuate the exploitation already present. It is crucial we work towards reform and greater awareness within the adult industry to ensure that these events do not happen again."},{"instruction":"Please add spaces between words: NextarticleSwiftKeyupdatedfornewnumpadoptions,bugfixe","output":"Next article: SwiftKey updated for new num-pad options, bug fixes."},{"instruction":"Aama (आमा) (Literally: Mother) is the first Nepali movie produced in Nepal, starring Shiva Shankar Manandhar and Bhuvan Chand (Thapa) as the leading actors.

In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum.

This allowed doctors to only select healthy embryos to implant. They are thought to be the only siblings in the UK to both have been conceived in this way. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Karen Mulchinock faced a difficult decision when she found out she had Huntington's disease, a genetic disorder that had already claimed the life of her father. She knew that if she had children naturally, there was a 50% chance they would inherit the disease. But thanks to advances in medical technology, Karen was able to have two healthy children, Daisy and Rosie, using pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis allows doctors to screen embryos for genetic disorders before they are implanted in the mother's uterus. This means that only healthy embryos are selected, greatly reducing the risk of passing on genetic diseases to future generations. Daisy and Rosie are thought to be the only siblings in the UK both conceived using pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. This technology has given Karen and her family hope for the future, knowing that they can break the cycle of Huntington's disease and ensure that future generations are not affected. While pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is a significant step forward in reproductive technology, it is important to note that it is not a perfect solution. The process can be expensive, and not all genetic disorders can be screened for. In addition, there are ethical concerns surrounding the selection and discarding of embryos. However, for families like Karen's, this technology offers a way to break the cycle of genetic diseases and ensure a healthy future for their children. It is a powerful reminder of the potential of medical technology to improve lives and provide hope in the face of difficult circumstances."},{"instruction":"Answer the question about text: People are just too afraid in this scary economy to invest in marketing right now , even though they know they should .

The songs were actually not as bad as some people say, Beautiful Briny Sea is the best, in fact all the songs are outstanding. The special effects were wonderful, that had plenty of magic, and the story is original enough. The highlights, though, like Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favourite was the football match, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism was that I didn't quite get the ending when I first saw it.

Move under the cover of darkness.","output":"When it comes to survival skills, being able to hide is just as important as being able to defend yourself. Knowing how to camouflage yourself and remain hidden from danger is a skill that anyone can learn. One of the simplest ways to hide is by climbing a tree. Not only does this elevate you above the ground, but it also makes it harder for others to spot you. Crouching in a bush is another effective method, as it provides natural cover while remaining relatively inconspicuous. If you have access to a garage or shed, retreating inside can be a quick and easy option. While it may not provide the best long-term cover, it can give you a temporary sanctuary until you can formulate a more comprehensive plan. Sneaking under the porch is often overlooked, but it can be a surprisingly effective hiding spot. Many animals and even some people don't think to look under the porch, making it a less-obvious option. During fall, lying in a pile of leaves is an excellent way to blend in with your surroundings. With the right clothing and gear, it's possible to look like a part of nature, helping to keep you hidden. Lastly, moving under the cover of darkness is a tried-and-true method of avoiding detection. Whether it's foraging for food or evading danger, night-time missions can be a useful tool in your survival arsenal. In conclusion, these are just a few of the many ways that you can hide when in a survival situation. By keeping these tips in mind and practicing them whenever possible, you can increase your chances of remaining undetected and ultimately increase your chances of survival."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question A state's consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the essential basis of the state's consent.

It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface.

HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2 to 4fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading generalpurpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).

For example, \\"self-care\\" and \\"home-cooked\\" are hyphenated words. To start brainstorming, think about the concept or idea you want to convey and break it down into smaller components. Try combining different words that describe these components and see if they can be hyphenated to form a new word that accurately conveys your intended meaning. It's also useful to experiment with different word orders and variations to find the perfect fit. Additionally, it's important to keep in mind any existing words or phrases that may be similar to what you're trying to create. You don't want to accidentally create a word that already exists, which can cause confusion and dilute the impact of your newly created word.

If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solidstate switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a lowvalue resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistorcapacitor combinations are available in a single package.

From coffee to hummus, beans play an important role in our diet. However, to get the most out of them, they must be ground properly. Grinding beans is the process of breaking them down into smaller pieces to help extract all the flavors and nutrients. There are several ways to grind beans, including using a coffee grinder, blender, or mortar and pestle. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Using a coffee grinder is perhaps the most common method of grinding beans. This machine is specifically designed to break down coffee beans into a fine powder. However, it can also be used to grind other types of beans. When using a coffee grinder, it's important to ensure that it's clean and the blades are sharp to prevent any unwanted flavors from contaminating your beans. Blenders are also a popular option for grinding beans. However, they are usually less effective than coffee grinders since they require more liquid to work correctly. If you choose to use a blender, be sure to use a small amount of liquid, such as water or oil, to help the beans grind efficiently. Finally, if you don't have access to a coffee grinder or blender, a mortar and pestle can be used. This method takes a bit more time and effort, but it's an effective way to grind beans into a fine powder. It's essential to use a heavy pestle and ensure that the mortar is stable to prevent slipping. In conclusion, grinding beans is an essential step to get the most out of your beans. It's important to use the correct method for the type of bean you're working with since each type of bean requires different methods to achieve an optimal grind. Whether you use a coffee grinder, blender, or mortar and pestle, the key is to grind your beans consistently and properly for optimal flavor and texture."},{"instruction":"Premise: And the nature of the work? she demanded.

It is important to recognize the symptoms of UTIs, which can vary depending on whether the infection is in the upper or lower urinary tract. Symptoms may include burning during urination, frequent urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pain in the lower abdomen or back. If you experience any of these symptoms, it is crucial to seek medical treatment because untreated UTIs can result in serious complications such as kidney damage. When diagnosed with a UTI, antibiotics are typically prescribed. It is essential to take the full course of antibiotics as directed, even if the symptoms improve before finishing the antibiotics. Failure to take the full course of antibiotics can result in the infection returning, and the bacteria may become resistant to the antibiotics. While UTIs are relatively common, there are still potential complications that one should be aware of. These complications may include recurrent UTIs, kidney damage, sepsis, and preterm birth in pregnant women. It is vital to seek medical treatment and take care of UTIs as soon as possible to avoid any complications. In summary, recognizing the symptoms of a UTI, seeking medical treatment, completing the course of antibiotics, and being aware of potential complications are all essential steps in managing and preventing UTIs.

While the 175,000 price tag may seem steep to some, it’s a small price to pay for a piece of history that will only become more valuable as time goes on.

Will Pascoe fails utterly in this effort, cobbling together uninspired snippets of Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is shot amateurishly and in video. Pascoe's only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen: 911, Activism, Truth. Lame. Compare this with documentaries like The Corporation or The Fog of War which create a narrative drawing material from interviews, stock footage, and filmed footage. In the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently. The only saving graces of the film are Chomsky's nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma, and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes. One of the more interesting passages was Chomsky's recounting of his experience with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views, while NPR's liberal dogma straitjackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages.

It all started when Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's potential candidacy came up in the conversation. Dean did not mince his words as he called out America's financial institutions for what he deemed as \\"oligopolies.\\" He further explained that while he does not personally hate banks, the reality is that they do not operate as capitalist organizations. The debate on capitalism has been a polarizing topic in recent years, with many criticizing the system for being unfair and favoring the wealthy. In Dean's opinion, big banks are a prime example of how capitalism is not working as it should. While the term \\"oligopoly\\" refers to a market controlled by only a few dominant players, Dean's argument was that the banking sector's control over the economy goes beyond just market share. He highlighted how these banks have close ties with the government and are often bailed out by taxpayers in times of crisis. Dean's statements have sparked a further conversation on the role of capitalism in the economy and how it affects different segments of society. It is a topic that deserves attention as the country moves towards the 2020 presidential race and debates on economic policies become more prominent. Overall, Dean's tirade may have been a moment of passion, but it also reflects a growing sentiment among many Americans who feel that the current economic system is not serving their interests. As the country enters a new phase of political discourse, it is up to policymakers to address these concerns and create policies that foster a more equitable society."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 9770 = 165*f + 508*f 1549 for f.","output":"The first step is to combine like terms on the right side of the equation, which gives: 9770 = 343f - 1549 Next, add 1549 to each side to isolate the variable term: 11319 = 343f Finally, divide both sides by 343 to solve for f: f = 33"},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"\\"Feeling grateful and blessed for all the opportunities and amazing people in my life.

Raptor hunting is a popular pastime in Scotland, where falconers train birds such as hawks and eagles to hunt prey. However, even the most trained birds are not always safe in the wild, as this recent incident shows. The captive eagle was hunting with its owner when it encountered a male golden eagle. The two birds clashed, with the tamed eagle managing to fend off the wild intruder. However, the victory was short-lived, as a larger female golden eagle soon appeared on the scene. The female eagle ruthlessly pursued the captive bird, which had nowhere to hide. Dramatic photos show the bird crashing into the snow as it tried to flee its pursuer.

One crucial aspect is changing the water regularly to remove waste, uneaten food, and other debris. However, it's essential to ensure that the new water added is safe for your fish. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change the water in your goldfish tank safely. Step 1: Prepare a Clean Bucket It's best to use a bucket that has only been used for aquarium-related tasks to avoid contamination. Fill the bucket with tap water and ensure that it's at room temperature. Step 2: Add a Dechlorinator Most tap water contains chlorine, which can harm your fish if not treated. You'll need to add a dechlorinator to the tap water in the bucket to make it safe for your goldfish. Follow the instructions on the product to ensure the correct dosage, based on the amount of water in the bucket. Step 3: Pour the Treated Water Into the Tank Gradually Using the bucket, gradually add the treated water to the tank. It's vital to do this slowly to avoid shocking your goldfish with sudden changes in temperature or water quality. Slowly pour the water into the tank, aiming for the area around the filter to circulate the water quickly. Step 4: Turn Your Tank Equipment Back On Once you've refilled the tank with treated water, turn on the equipment, including the filter, heater, and air pump. Ensure that everything is working correctly before putting the hood and lights back. In conclusion, changing the water in your goldfish tank is a simple task that can improve the quality of life for your fish. However, it's essential to take precautions to avoid harming your fish. Following the four steps outlined above, you can safely change the water in your tank regularly."},{"instruction":"Pharmaceutical industry: Others have argued that excessive regulation suppresses therapeutic innovation, and that the current cost of regulatorrequired clinical trials prevents the full exploitation of new genetic and biological knowledge for the treatment of human disease.

The first step is to obtain material for the lacing loops. You can use ribbon, bias tape, or any other suitable fabric. Cut the material into a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide strip using a pair of sharp scissors. Make sure the edges are straight and even. Next, place the strip of fabric right side down on your sewing machine and sew using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Be sure to backstitch at the beginning and end of every stitch line. Sew the entire length of the strip, leaving both ends open. Once the strip is sewn, you can turn it right-side-out. Use a turning tool or a small tool like a chopstick to carefully turn the fabric inside out. It may take a little bit of patience, but be gentle to avoid tearing the fabric. Now that the strip is turned right-side-out, cut it into short segments. The length here will depend on how many loops you will need for your dress. Usually, four or more loops are sufficient. Make sure each loop is of equal length. Using pins, attach the lacing loops to your dress. Start by pinning one end of the loop to the inside of the dress, near the edge of the opening where the lacing will go. Then, pin the other end of the loop to the opposite side of the opening, again near the edge. Once the loops are all pinned in place, you can sew the opening shut. Use a matching thread and sew as close to the edge as possible. Be sure to remove the pins as you go. Finally, lace up your dress using the loops you have just made. Take the end of the lacing material and thread it through one loop, then cross it over and thread it through the opposite loop. Continue lacing up the dress this way until you reach the top.

It has been reported that a student named Mundill Mahil, who was then 20 years old, was behind the motive for this heinous crime. Mahil allegedly got two men to take revenge on Singh, who she claimed had sexually assaulted her. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Singh actually committed any such offense.

It is crucial to be vigilant in pursuing justice while also ensuring that innocent people are not wrongly accused or punished. Furthermore, it also sheds light on the issue of sexual assault and how accusations should be taken seriously but must also be investigated thoroughly to ensure that justice is served for both the alleged victims and the accused.

This simple yet effective method allows you to create a loop that can be used for a variety of purposes, from securing items to creating a handle for your rope. To begin, you will need a rope of sufficient length and thickness. Grasp the left-hand rope with your left hand and slide your hand along the length of the rope until it is approximately halfway down. Take the loose end of the rope with your right hand and bring it up to meet your left hand, creating a double-up of the left-hand rope. Now, take the double-up of the left-hand rope and lay it over the top of the rope in your right hand. This will create a loop in the rope, with the double-up forming the top portion of the loop and the rope in your right hand forming the bottom. To secure the loop, bring the double-up back down and around the right-hand rope, tucking it underneath itself and pulling tight. You should now have a sturdy loop in your rope that can be used for a variety of purposes. Some common uses for a loop in a rope include securing items in place, creating a handle for the rope, or attaching the rope to a fixed point such as a tree or post. Overall, mastering the technique of creating a loop using a double-up of the left-hand rope is a valuable skill for anyone who uses ropes regularly. With a little practice, you will find that it is a simple yet effective way to create loops that are strong, secure, and versatile enough for a variety of applications."},{"instruction":"Dizzy Gillespie played what instrument?","output":"Trumpet."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: be a true showstopper with this pair of boots available in amazing colors .","output":"Keywords: showstopper, boots, amazing, colors."},{"instruction":"Claim: Professional cheerleading sexualises teenagers and young women What evidence supports this claim?","output":"The claim that professional cheerleading sexualizes teenagers and young women is supported by the fact that cheerleaders are required to wear revealing outfits and perform suggestive dances, which can contribute to objectifying them as sexual objects.

Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier – for example, the fact that it is a ship means that a fulllength runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects takeoff procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced takeoff load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck.

Google and Facebook will deploy new technology to fight child porngraphy.","output":"The UK government is stepping up its fight against child pornography on the dark net by using the latest technology to track down those who share illegal content over secret networks. GCHQ and the National Crime Agency are at the forefront of this effort, using digital fingerprints on dark net areas to identify paedophiles and bring them to justice. Prime Minister David Cameron has stated that the unit will \\"shine a light\\" on the most nefarious corners of the web. As part of the effort, tech giants Google and Facebook are launching new technology to combat the spread of child pornography. The tools being developed will allow these companies to detect and report any images that are uploaded or shared that match known illegal content. This will help stop the spread of this abhorrent material and make it harder for paedophiles to access it in the first place. The use of digital fingerprints allows investigators to track down those who use hidden services, which are specifically designed to keep users anonymous. These services can be accessed only by using special software, which means that it's extremely difficult for law enforcement to identify those who use them. However, by using digital fingerprints, law enforcement agencies are able to piece together the networks and catch those who use them for illegal purposes. This approach has already proved successful, with law enforcement agencies around the world using digital fingerprints to track down paedophiles on the dark net. As technology continues to develop, it's expected that we will see more and more successful prosecutions of those who use the dark net to distribute illegal content. In conclusion, the use of digital fingerprints and new technology is a promising development in the fight against child pornography on the dark net. By shining a light on the web's darkest corners and deploying the latest tools, we can make the internet a safer place for everyone. The ongoing work of GCHQ, the National Crime Agency, and tech giants like Google and Facebook is vital in our ongoing efforts to stamp out this abhorrent crime."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise It's an exciting and wellplanned aquarium, interesting whatever the weather but certainly a good place to spend a rainy afternoon., can we conclude the hypothesis The aquarium can be interesting on rainy afternoons. is true?
