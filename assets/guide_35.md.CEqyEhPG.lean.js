The whale in question was a colossal beast, measuring an astonishing 58.5ft from nose to tail. It had washed up on the shore of a local beach near Burton Constable Hall almost two centuries ago, and even in death, it continued to capture the imaginations of those who encountered it. Melville was one such person, and he chronicled his experience of seeing the whale's skeleton in his classic work, Moby-Dick. Melville was not the first person to be struck by the dramatic presence of the whale. In fact, it was a local landowner, Sir Henry Constable, who first came across the creature in 1825. The impact of the discovery was such that the skeleton of the whale became one of the biggest draws for visitors to the stately home in the years that followed. Melville was among those visitors, and his encounter with the whale may well have helped shape the themes and imagery in Moby-Dick. The novel, which tells the story of a man's dangerous obsession with hunting down a giant sperm whale, is filled with allusions to the whale's immense size and power. For Melville, therefore, the chance to see the skeleton of a sperm whale up close would have been an unforgettable experience. It would have provided him with an insight into the sheer scale and majesty of these creatures that he could never have gleaned from mere descriptions or illustrations. Almost two centuries after the whale's death, its skeleton continues to fascinate and inspire. It is a reminder of the enduring power of nature, and of the human fascination with the ocean and its creatures.

She had resorted to seeking medical assistance twice, but the tests conducted did not detect any presence of DVT. Later, paramedics detected a heart condition called tachycardia which caused chest pains and difficulty in breathing. However, it has come to light that Mrs Nour's doctor was not informed of this critical condition. The incident highlights the need for better communication in the healthcare system. Patients should be provided with accurate information about their conditions, and healthcare professionals should take each report of complications seriously. Inadequate communication in the healthcare system can have dire consequences for patients like Mrs Nour, who deserve the highest level of care. This also underscores the importance of proper diagnosis procedures that can identify underlying conditions as early as possible. Doctors and health workers must be armed with the latest technologies and tools to detect any underlying issues in patients. The medical community must ensure that they are equipped to handle cases like Mrs Nour's to ensure they can provide efficient and effective treatment to their patients. Moreover, there is a need for more significant investment in research and development of medical technologies that can accurately detect health conditions. The government and the medical industry must work together to invest in innovative medical technology solutions that can significantly improve diagnosis outcomes, helping detect life-threatening medical conditions early and saving countless lives. In conclusion, the case of Maxine Nour is a reminder that the healthcare system can be improved by elevating the standards of patient care and communication. Healthcare providers must remain vigilant, and medical technologies must be continually developed to ensure a high level of care is provided to patients. Only by taking steps to improve care can we hope to avoid tragic incidents and improve the health and safety of all citizens."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

This discovery has led to the creation of a simple DNA test that will be available at an upcoming exhibition at Olympia in London next month. The discovery of the gene variant has shed new light on the inheritance of red hair, which was previously thought to be a simple genetic trait passed down from parents to their children. However, researchers now know that it is possible for someone to carry the gene variant without displaying any signs of having red hair themselves. The simple DNA test, which will be available for attendees of the exhibition, will allow people to learn whether or not they carry the gene variant. This information could be crucial for couples who are planning to have children, as it could give them a better understanding of the likelihood of their children having ginger hair. The gene variant is not only responsible for red hair but also influences skin and eye color. Therefore, people who carry this gene variant are more likely to have fair skin that is sensitive to sunlight and may be at a higher risk of developing skin cancer. Knowing whether or not you carry the gene variant can help you make informed decisions about your health and wellbeing. In conclusion, the upcoming exhibition at Olympia in London will give people the opportunity to learn more about the inheritance of red hair and the gene variant responsible for it.

However, there are a few simple guidelines that can help you provide effective support. Firstly, you should always ask if assistance is needed before offering any help. This shows respect for the person’s autonomy and allows them to communicate their needs clearly. Once you have established that assistance is needed, the next step is to identify the cause of pain. This may involve asking questions, observing the person’s behaviour, or simply listening to what they have to say. It is important to approach this process with compassion and without judgement. Once you have identified the cause of pain, you may be able to provide appropriate physical contact to alleviate the person’s discomfort. This could involve offering a hug, placing a hand on their shoulder, or holding their hand. However, it is important to note that physical contact should always be guided by the person’s comfort level and consent. Throughout the process of providing support, it is important to focus on the positive. By offering reassurance and encouragement, you can help the person to feel more optimistic about their situation. This can be particularly effective when combined with active listening and empathetic responses. Finally, it is important to remember that crying can be a healthy and natural response to pain or distress. If the person feels the need to cry, it is important to allow them to do so without judgement or interruption. By providing a safe and supportive space, you can help them to process their emotions and move forward towards healing."},{"instruction":"Next question: bible verse rain falls on the just and unjust?","output":"The bible verse you are referring to is Matthew 5:45 which says, \\"He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\\""},{"instruction":"Q: How many colors were 45s available in when first released?

Upon finding the exhausted and malnourished teen, the former police officer flagged down a police car, and Mitch was ultimately admitted to the hospital. The young man claimed that his stepfather put him on a bus to California, where he was found in poor condition. The incident led to the arrest of his parents, Paul and Sheila Comer, who will be put on trial on Thursday.

He was put through cruel and unusual punishment by being forced to stand on his tiptoes with his hands on his head, facing a wall for 8 hours every day.

Calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts. Subtract your allowance for doubtful accounts from accounts receivable. Find net accounts receivable as a percentage.","output":"Managing accounts receivable is a crucial aspect of any business, as it directly impacts cash flow and the ability to meet financial obligations. One important step in managing accounts receivable is calculating the allowance for doubtful accounts, which is a reserve set aside to cover potential losses from customers who may not pay their outstanding debts. Here are the steps to follow: Step 1: Sum all accounts receivable The first step is to add up all the outstanding balances owed to the company by customers. This includes all invoices that have not been paid yet and any other outstanding balances such as loans or credit lines. Step 2: Calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is a reserve that companies set up to cover the potential losses from customers who may not pay their debts. This allowance is based on an estimation of the percentage of customers who may default on their payments. To calculate the allowance, businesses typically multiply the total accounts receivable balance by a predetermined percentage. This percentage varies depending on the industry and the company's historical experience with customer defaults. Step 3: Subtract your allowance Once you have calculated the allowance for doubtful accounts, you need to subtract it from the total accounts receivable balance. By doing this, you will obtain the net accounts receivable figure, which represents the amount of money the company can realistically expect to collect from its customers. Step 4: Calculate net accounts receivable as a percentage Finally, you can express the net accounts receivable figure as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance. This percentage is known as the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which is a metric used to measure the efficiency of a company's collections process. In conclusion, managing accounts receivable is essential for a healthy cash flow and requires close attention to detail. By following these steps, companies can calculate their allowance for doubtful accounts, minimize the risk of unpaid debts, and improve their overall financial health."},{"instruction":"Premise: and you whip the line If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis And you jerk the line.?

He was taken from the vicinity of the Iraqi Ministry of Justice in the city of Karada while visiting his family.

Drawing from such concepts as the international scientific vocabulary and Standard Average European, linguists[who?] developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.[citation needed] Researchers at the International Auxiliary Language Association extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary. In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects. This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.

This is variously known as distilled spirit, \`\`virgin'' vinegar, or white vinegar, and is used in cooking, baking, meat preservation, and pickling, as well as for medicinal, laboratory, and cleaning purposes. The most common starting material in some regions, because of its low cost, is malt, or in the United States, corn. It is sometimes derived from petroleum. Distilled vinegar in the UK is produced by the distillation of malt to give a clear vinegar which maintains some of the malt flavour.

Make sure it's protected from any disturbances or predators. A small mason jar with holes on the lid or a small mesh cage are good options. Next, base your anticipated timeline on the season. The timeline varies depending on the type of butterfly and the climate. Research beforehand to know when the butterfly is supposed to emerge from the cocoon. Patience is crucial in this process. As the butterfly's time of emergence approaches, look for the cocoon to change color. If it's becoming darker or translucent, it's a sign the butterfly is getting ready to come out. Be sure to observe closely and not miss this moment. When the butterfly emerges, provide a sugar and water solution as its first drink. In the wild, butterflies drink from nectar, so this solution will provide similar nutrients. After a few hours, offer small slices of fruit or flowers for the butterfly to feed on. Finally, provide food for your butterfly. If you want to keep your butterfly for a few days, then feed it with fruits and flowers with sugar water. If you want to release your butterfly at the earliest, you can skip providing food. Caring for a butterfly is an excellent way to learn about nature and raise awareness about conservation.

The incident raises serious concerns about surgical protocols and the safety of patients during procedures. It is devastating to imagine the pain and trauma that Schroeder must have endured following the surgery. The fact that items were left inside his body is a major failure on the part of the medical professionals involved. Patients trust healthcare providers to prioritize their well-being and safety, and it is unacceptable for negligence to occur during surgery. Schroeder's case is a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability within the healthcare system. Patients and their families must feel confident that their concerns will be heard and addressed, and that appropriate action will be taken when necessary. This includes offering support to those impacted by medical errors, as well as implementing measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

It is crucial for healthcare providers to prioritize patient safety and take steps to minimize the risk of errors occurring during surgical procedures.

Use caution when trying Chinese herbal medicine.","output":"Improving Egg Quality: Supplements to Discuss with Your Doctor If you're trying to conceive, you may have heard that your egg quality can be a significant factor in your chances of becoming pregnant. While there's no guaranteed way to improve egg quality, some supplements have been shown to potentially have some positive effects. Here are some supplements to consider discussing with your doctor: Coenzyme Q10: This antioxidant can protect cells, including egg cells, from damage. Some studies suggest that taking CoQ10 supplements may improve egg quality, but more research is needed to confirm these findings. L-carnitine: This amino acid plays a role in energy production and is naturally found in the body. Some studies suggest that taking L-carnitine supplements may improve egg quality when used in combination with clomiphene, a medication used to induce ovulation. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC): This supplement has antioxidant properties and can also help the body produce glutathione, a substance that protects cells from damage. Some studies suggest that taking NAC supplements may improve egg quality in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DHEA: This hormone is naturally produced by the body and has been shown to potentially improve egg quality in women with diminished ovarian reserve. However, it's essential to talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking DHEA, as it can have side effects such as acne and hair growth. When choosing supplements, look for ones that are third-party certified to ensure their quality and purity. It's also important to use caution when trying Chinese herbal medicine, as some herbs may contain harmful substances or interact with other medications you're taking. Remember, taking supplements alone is unlikely to improve egg quality significantly.

This evidentiary privilege ensures that defendants cannot be compelled to become witnesses at their own trials.

The Amendment requires that felonies be tried only upon indictment by a grand jury.

Following increased seismic activity, scientists were brought in to assess the risk and provide a warning if necessary. However, the major earthquake that hit L'Aquila was not predicted by the scientists. According to prosecutors, the risk assessment provided by the scientists was generic and ineffective in preventing the tragedy. This situation highlights the importance of accurate risk assessment and communication in disaster prevention. While it is impossible to predict natural disasters with complete accuracy, it is crucial to use the available information to provide the best possible warning and evacuation procedures. This requires professional and meticulous risk assessment, which is why it is essential to have dedicated teams of experts providing continual monitoring of seismic activity, weather patterns, and other indicators of potential disasters. Furthermore, it is necessary to communicate the risks effectively to the public. In the case of L'Aquila, the scientist's predictions were framed in technical terms and conveyed to the public in a way that was not easily understood. This lack of clear communication contributed to the tragic outcome.

Judge said she was ‘not the purely private figure she claims to be'","output":"Carina Trimingham Faces Legal Costs After Failed Claim Against Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday Carina Trimingham, a former adviser to Liberal Democrat politician Chris Huhne, has described the stories referring to her sexuality which were published after her secret affair became public as ‘highly unpleasant and hurtful’. However, her attempts to sue the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday over their coverage of her relationship have been rejected by Mr Justice Tugendhat. The judge threw out her claim for damages, leaving her with estimated legal costs of £410,000. The judge said she was ‘not the purely private figure she claims to be’. The stories published about her in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday related to Trimingham's affair with Huhne, who was at the time a married man and a prominent political figure. Trimingham had argued that the articles were an invasion of her privacy and had caused her significant distress. She also claimed that the newspapers had portrayed her in a negative light, using language which was designed to be demeaning. Despite these arguments, the judge concluded that Trimingham had put herself in the public eye by working as an adviser to a prominent politician. He also suggested that her relationship with Huhne was not a trivial matter, but rather something which was of significant public interest. The ruling will come as a blow to Trimingham, who has already been forced to pay a significant sum in legal fees. It is also likely to have implications for others who work in public life, as it suggests that they may not be able to claim privacy rights in certain situations. Overall, this case highlights the challenges that people in the public eye face when it comes to their personal lives being exposed by the media. Although Trimingham may feel that she has been treated unfairly, the judge's ruling implies that the public has a legitimate interest in knowing about the private lives of those who hold positions of power and influence."},{"instruction":"Select the topic that this about: BENSALEM, Pa.

The team has been struggling to perform well in the Formula One races, and is currently at the bottom of the constructor's championship. Albers' departure will only add to the team's woes, as they will have to cope with the loss of an experienced CEO. While the exact reasons for Albers' resignation have not been disclosed, it is clear that there are some personal issues that need to be dealt with. Albers himself has acknowledged that it was a difficult decision to make, but one that was necessary for the sake of his personal life. He has also expressed his desire to continue supporting the team in any way he can. The onus will now be on Manfredi Ravetto to steer Caterham out of troubled waters. Ravetto, who has previously worked as the general manager of Lotus F1 Team, has a wealth of experience in the sport. He will need to work closely with the team's engineers and drivers to come up with a strategy that will help them perform better. The task ahead of Ravetto will not be easy. Caterham has been struggling for a while now, and it will take a lot of effort and hard work to turn things around. However, under his leadership, the team will have a chance to regroup and come back stronger. In conclusion, Christijan Albers' resignation from his position as CEO of Caterham is a blow to the team, especially at a time when they are struggling to perform well in the Formula One races. However, with the appointment of Manfredi Ravetto as the team principal, there is hope that the team will be able to turn things around and perform better in the upcoming races. It remains to be seen how Ravetto will fare in his new role, but he has the experience and knowledge required to make a positive impact."},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: CarterJubehfromAzerbaijanofPCMAG.COM:AfterourtechnicaldetectionandfeedbackresearchfromIsleofMan,Runion,FrenchPolynesia,SriLanka,Azerbaijan,IneedtosaythatDLLSuiteisthemostoutstandingDLLFixerinthisfieldwithitshighefficiencyandeffect.","output":"Carter Jubeh from Azerbaijan of PCMAG.COM: After our technical detection and feedback research from Isle of Man, Runion, French Polynesia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, I need to say that DLL Suite is the most outstanding DLL Fixer in this field with its high efficiency and effect."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Ashgabat International Airport, location, Ashgabat; Ashgabat International Airport, elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres, 211","output":"The location of Ashgabat International Airport is in Ashgabat and it boasts an elevation above the sea level in meters of 211."},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Thereareplenty...Readmore","output":"There are plenty...

Step 1: Choose your cheese The first step in making the perfect sandwich is to choose your cheese. Do you prefer something creamy like brie or something tangy like goat cheese? Maybe you enjoy the classic taste of cheddar or the sharpness of Swiss. Whatever your preference is, make sure to choose a cheese that works well with the other ingredients you plan to use. Step 2: Toast your sandwich If you prefer a warm sandwich, you can have it toasted. This will add a nice texture and flavor to your sandwich. You can have it toasted in a toaster oven or on a panini press. Step 3: Start with larger vegetables Now it’s time to assemble your sandwich. Start with larger vegetables, such as tomato or lettuce. These will serve as the base of your sandwich. Step 4: Layer on smaller toppings Once you have your larger vegetables in place, add smaller toppings, like cucumber or onion. These will add additional flavor and texture to your sandwich. Step 5: Choose your sauces Sauces are a great way to add flavor to your sandwich. You can choose something classic like mayo or mustard, or be more adventurous with a spicy aioli or pesto. Make sure to choose a sauce that complements the other flavors in your sandwich. Step 6: Finish with oils or spices If you want to add some extra flavor to your sandwich, you can finish it off with some oils or spices. A drizzle of olive oil or a sprinkle of black pepper can take your sandwich to the next level. Step 7: Make it like the photo If you are overwhelmed with all the different ingredients to choose from, you can always ask the sandwich maker to make it like the photo. This way, you don’t have to worry about choosing your own toppings and can trust that the sandwich will taste great. In conclusion, making the perfect sandwich is all about choosing the right ingredients and assembling them in the right way.

Talk about likes and dislikes. Ask questions for a more interesting conversation. Find things you have in common.","output":"Starting a conversation with someone can be intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. One easy way to get started is by talking about your surroundings. Whether you're at a party, a conference or just out for a walk, the environment around you can offer plenty of talking points. You could comment on the decor, the weather or the music playing in the background. Once you've broken the ice, it's time to delve a little deeper. Talk about your likes and dislikes, and ask the other person about theirs. This can help you to find out more about each other and to discover any shared interests you might have. For example, if you both enjoy hiking, you could talk about your favorite trails, or if you both dislike reality TV shows, you could chat about why. Asking questions is key to having an interesting conversation. By asking the other person about their experiences, opinions and ideas, you're showing a genuine interest in them as a person. You could ask about their job, their family, their hobbies or their travels. Remember to listen carefully to their responses and ask follow-up questions to keep the conversation flowing. Finally, finding things you have in common can help to create a connection between you and the other person. Perhaps you grew up in the same town or went to the same college. Maybe you both love Thai food or share a passion for rock climbing. Whatever it is, finding common ground can help you to build rapport and to establish a more meaningful relationship. Starting a conversation can be daunting, but it doesn't have to be. By talking about your surroundings, sharing your likes and dislikes, asking questions and finding things in common, you can have an interesting and engaging conversation with anyone. So next time you find yourself in a social situation, take a deep breath, relax and start chatting!"},{"instruction":"Write a dialog with this premise Norman took a video of Marco being attacked..","output":"Person 1: \\"Hey, have you heard about what happened to Marco?\\" Person 2: \\"No, what happened?\\" Person 1: \\"Apparently, Norman took a video of him being attacked.\\" Person 2: \\"What?

Some newer DVD players feature a repair+skip algorithm, which alleviates this problem by continuing to play the disc, filling in unreadable areas of the picture with blank space or a frozen frame of the last readable image and sound. The success of this feature depends upon the amount of damage. LaserDisc players, when working in full analog, recover from such errors faster than DVD players.

A 1 in (3 cm) scratch on a DVD will probably cause more problems than a 1 in (3 cm) scratch on a LaserDisc, but a fingerprint taking up 1% of the area of a DVD would almost certainly cause fewer problems than a similar mark covering 1% of the surface of a LaserDisc.[citation needed] Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply unanswerable): Which format, DVD or Laserdisc, can become unreadable with damage?","output":"Both DVD and Laserdisc can become unreadable with damage, but DVD is more likely to become unplayable past the damage."},{"instruction":"who wrote the magna carta and when was it written??","output":"The Magna Carta was written by a group of English barons and was issued by King John of England in June 1215."},{"instruction":"The dollar extended its losses on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected but signaled that both inflation and inflation expectations were easing.

Multiply the decimal number by 100.","output":"Multiplying a decimal number by 100 is a simple and useful mathematical operation. This can be done by shifting the decimal point two places to the right. For example, if the decimal number is 0.35, multiplying it by 100 would give you 35. Why would you want to multiply a decimal number by 100? One reason is to convert a decimal into a percentage. In many applications, percentages are a more convenient way to represent numbers. For instance, a discount of 0.1 on a 100 item is harder to understand than a discount of 10%. By multiplying the decimal number by 100, you can easily convert it into a percentage. In this example, 0.1 would become 10%. Multiplying a decimal by 100 is also useful when comparing numbers. For instance, if you know the percentage increase of a stock, you can quickly calculate how much it has gone up in value. If a stock has gone up by 0.05%, for example, you can multiply this by 100 to get 5%. This makes it easier to compare the performance of different stocks. In summary, multiplying a decimal number by 100 is a simple and useful mathematical operation. This can be used to convert a decimal into a percentage or make it easier to compare numbers. By remembering how to do this, you can make your mathematical calculations more efficient and effective."},{"instruction":"AprettybigmomentformetocrosstheborderacrosstheDanube.HadheardofaBulgarian“ecologicaltax”at10eurowhicheverybodyissupposedtopay,buttoustherewasonlylaughter,smile,thumpsup,andapairofgapinglooksfromthefrontierguardswhentheyheardaboutourlongbikingtrip.

This is not information that we collected on European citizens, the NSA chief says.","output":"In a recent press conference, the committee chair made an important point that trying to gather information on foreign leaders' intentions is not a unique practice of the United States. The gathering of such information is common across the globe and is an essential part of national security practices. The statement comes after a series of controversies over the National Security Agency's (NSA) collection of intelligence and invasion of privacy concerns. During the press conference, the NSA chief also commented on the leaked documents that were obtained by media outlets. He stated that the media misinterpreted the documents and that the NSA did not collect information on European citizens. The documents were taken out of context and did not represent the entire scope of NSA operations. The practice of spying on foreign leaders is not a new concept, and it is not unique to the United States. Countries across the world use similar tactics to gather intelligence on other nations. The practice is essential in gaining an advantage over other countries and maintaining national security. Trying to determine the intentions of foreign leaders is an essential part of gathering intelligence. This can be done through monitoring communications between leaders, tracking travel patterns, and analyzing public speeches and appearances. The information gathered in this way can provide crucial insights into the way foreign countries operate and their intentions towards other nations. In conclusion, the gathering of information on foreign leaders is a common practice across the world. It is not unique to the United States, and it is an essential part of national security practices. Misinterpretation of leaked documents has led to unnecessary controversies surrounding the NSA's operations. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the practice of spying on foreign leaders will continue to be an important tool in maintaining national security."},{"instruction":"So we came here unsure what to expect, but we were craving some Thai so we went for it.

Meanwhile, the dialogue is clunky and exposition-heavy, with characters spouting off long monologues that serve only to confuse the audience further.

It is not just about hearing what the other person is saying but also understanding and respecting their perspective. When it comes to behavior, it can often be misunderstood or misinterpreted, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings. Therefore, it is crucial to listen to how your partner explains their behavior and notice their response. When your boyfriend or girlfriend is explaining their behavior, listen carefully without interrupting. Try to put yourself in their shoes and see things from their perspective. Notice the response, including their body language, tone of voice, and words they choose. After a few moments of silence and once the story has finished, recall one of the details that stuck out to you. Pay attention to what happens now. Ask a detailed question related to that particular detail, and observe their response. If they answer sincerely, it means that they have nothing to hide. But if they become defensive or start avoiding that part, it could mean that they are hiding something. However, we should not leap to conclusions of hiding anything without facts and learn to trust them. When you ask questions, expect to be questioned back, and wait patiently for their response. It's a two-way street, and it's better to have open communication to avoid any misunderstandings. Listening and asking more questions will help you to get a better understanding of your partner's behavior, and they may also appreciate the effort and trust you are placing in them. However, be mindful of the questions you ask and how you phrase them. Ensure that they do not sound accusatory or make assumptions. Also, take responsibility for your emotions and reactions. If you feel upset or hurt, express that in a calm and respectful manner. To summarize, paying attention when your partner explains their behavior, asking detailed questions, and waiting patiently is crucial for healthy communication. When you listen and ask questions, make sure to do so respectfully without insinuating anything.
