The U.S. attorney says there was insufficient evidence for charges to be brought. U.S. attorney says the closing of the case does not prove what did or didn't happen. Fine called allegations patently false when they first surfaced. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Federal prosecutors recently concluded an investigation into sex abuse allegations made against former Syracuse University assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine. The U.S. attorney's office stated that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against Fine, but cautioned that the decision to close the case does not necessarily indicate guilt or innocence on his part. When the accusations first surfaced, Fine vehemently denied them, calling them \\"patently false.\\" The allegations were made by two former ball boys who claimed that Fine had sexually abused them when they were minors in the 1980s and 1990s. The alleged abuse continued over a period of several years, and the ball boys claimed that they had reported it to university officials at the time but were ignored. The investigation by federal prosecutors took a significant amount of time, and many people were eagerly awaiting the outcome. While some are disappointed that Fine will not face criminal charges, others are relieved that the matter has finally been resolved. It is important to note that the decision not to bring charges does not necessarily indicate that the allegations were false or that Fine is innocent. Rather, it means that the prosecution did not have enough evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. In the wake of the investigation, many are calling for changes to be made to prevent similar allegations from being ignored or swept under the rug in the future. The university has taken steps to improve its reporting procedures and has acknowledged that it did not respond appropriately to the ball boys' complaints when they were made. Overall, the conclusion of the investigation brings some closure to a highly controversial and emotionally charged case. While many questions still remain unanswered, it is clear that the impact of these allegations will be felt for years to come."},{"instruction":"Sumur (Biblical Hebrew: [collective noun denoting the city inhabitants]; Egyptian: Smr; Akkadian: Sumuru; Assyrian: Simirra) was a Phoenician city in what is now Syria.

This WWII-era tunnel supplies half of New York City's water, but it has a major problem - it's cracked. The project to fix the tunnel is slated to cost 1.5 billion and is expected to end in 2023 after the tunnel is completely shut off. The Delaware Aqueduct is a critical source of water for New York City, providing roughly half of the city's daily needs. The tunnel was built between 1939 and 1945 and has been in operation ever since. However, over the years, the tunnel has developed cracks, which have led to significant leaks in the system. To repair the tunnel, crews are using a variety of techniques. One approach involves installing steel liners inside the tunnel to reinforce it and prevent it from leaking further. Another approach involves excavating the ground around the tunnel and then sealing it with concrete to prevent water infiltration. The repair project is a massive undertaking, with crews working around the clock to fix the tunnel. Once completed, the tunnel will be able to continue supplying New York City with the water it needs for years to come. However, until then, residents of the city will need to be mindful of their water usage, as the project could lead to temporary water shortages in some areas. Despite the high cost of the project, city officials have stressed the importance of investing in critical infrastructure like the Delaware Aqueduct.

Seek out physical therapy.","output":"Gastrocnemius and soleus are two muscles that make up the calf complex, but how do they differ from each other? The gastrocnemius is the larger, more visible muscle that forms the curved contour of the calf. It aids in the movement of the ankle joint, particularly in plantar flexion (pointing the toes down). The soleus is a smaller muscle that lies deeper within the calf, also assisting in plantar flexion. Injury to the gastrocnemius and soleus can be common for athletes or anyone who overuses or strains their calf muscles. A common way to treat an injury is through the R.I.C.E (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) method. Rest your calf, applying ice intermittently for 20-30 minutes at a time to help reduce pain and inflammation, and add compression with a bandage or brace. Elevating the injured area above the heart can also help reduce inflammation. However, rest and ice alone may not be enough for a debilitating injury to the calf muscles. In cases of more severe strain or damage, physical therapy can help. A physical therapist can diagnose the cause of the injury and offer specific and individualized treatment plans that aim to reduce pain, increase range of motion, and improve strength through exercises and stretches. In conclusion, while both gastrocnemius and soleus share the same function in the calf complex, a differentiation must be made to know which specific muscle is injured or strained. If experiencing any calf pain, it is recommended to follow the R.I.C.E. protocol and seek physical therapy for additional help."},{"instruction":"This entire incident took only approximately 5 minutes and these objects travelled almost 1000 miles in 5 minutes2 What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"This entire incident took only approximately 5 minutes, and these objects traveled almost 1000 miles in 5 minutes."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: a threenation mission today completed a fiveday investigation tour of the proposed site of the lightwater nuclear reactors in the democratic people 's republic of korea lrb dprk rrb .","output":"A mission from three nations completed a five-day investigation tour of the proposed site of nuclear reactors in North Korea."},{"instruction":"Topranked Amelie Mauresmo of France withdrew from the Kremlin Cup in Moscow yesterday, a day after a thigh injury forced her to quit during a final in Germany against Lindsay Davenport.

Buy stitch markers for knitting in the round. Have scissors and a tapestry needle to finish the hat.","output":"If you're a beginner knitter looking to tackle your first hat project, you'll want to keep a few things in mind before getting started. First, you'll need to choose a yarn that you love and that works well for hats. Look for yarn that is warm, durable, and soft to the touch. There are many different types of yarn on the market, so take your time and choose one that fits your needs and budget. Once you've selected a yarn, consider using circular needles that are sized appropriately for the yarn you've chosen. Circular needles help to prevent strain on your hands and are great for working on larger projects like hats. They also make it easier to knit in the round and create a seamless look. With circular needles, you can easily slide your work back and forth, making it a breeze to knit up your hat quickly. Next on your list is to buy stitch markers. Knitting in the round requires a bit of organization, which is where stitch markers come in handy. They help to keep track of the beginning and end of each round, so you know where you are in the pattern. This is especially important if you're new to knitting in the round and less comfortable with the technique. To finish your hat, you'll need scissors and a tapestry needle. Scissors are essential for trimming yarn, while a tapestry needle is used for weaving in the ends of your hat. By using a tapestry needle, you can hide the ends of each yarn piece, creating a clean and polished finish to your hat. In summary, choosing the right yarn, using circular needles sized for your yarn, buying stitch markers for knitting in the round, and having scissors and a tapestry needle on hand are key to knitting a successful hat. With these materials in place, you'll be well on your way to creating beautiful and functional hats for yourself and your loved ones.

Adoboli's lawyer has said that his client \\"stands appalled at the consequences of his disastrous miscalculations.\\" Adoboli's story has been one of highs and lows. As a trader at UBS, he made millions of pounds for the bank, but his high-risk trades eventually resulted in losses of 2.3 billion. Adoboli was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison in 2012, but he was released in 2015. Now, Adoboli is back in court facing a second charge of fraud. His lawyer argues that Adoboli was trying to cover up losses that he had already incurred, rather than trying to make a profit for himself. Regardless of his intentions, Adoboli's actions had serious consequences for the bank, its shareholders, and the wider financial industry. The case highlights the importance of risk management in the financial industry. When traders take on too much risk, they can cause huge losses for their employers and put the entire financial system at risk. It's up to regulators, banks, and traders themselves to manage risk effectively and prevent disasters like the one that Adoboli's trades caused. As for Adoboli himself, he will have to face the consequences of his actions. His lawyer has said that he is appalled at what has happened, but that will not be enough to mitigate the damage caused by his trades.

Other cities in the United Kingdom also have notable commuting times. For example, workers in Manchester spend an average of one hour and four minutes on the move. Bristol's commuters come in third, with an average daily commute time of one hour. The effects of long commutes can be significant. Prolonged time spent in transit can lead to stress, lack of sleep, and a decrease in productivity. Additionally, longer commutes can contribute to a decrease in wellbeing. But not all is lost. Advances in remote working and flexible working schedules have made it easier for some commuters to reduce their daily travel time. However, these options are not available to everyone. Overall, commuting is a reality many people face daily. While it can be challenging, there are ways to make it easier. Whether it's listening to a podcast, reading a book or finding ways to save time, there are small things we can do to make our daily commutes more manageable."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Oliver: hey Jean: hi Oliver: how are you?

A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo. The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women, respectively. Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol.

The £20,000ayear school was named independent school of the year. But Mr Halls said it's in danger of being greedy as fees 'timebomb' ticks. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The head of King's College School in Wimbledon, Andrew Halls, has spoken out about the difficulties faced by local families in affording the school's fees. Halls has claimed that the rise in fees is due to the number of rich families from outside the UK sending their children to the school. The £20,000-a-year school was named independent school of the year, but Halls has expressed concern at the risk of the school becoming greedy as the 'time-bomb' of rising fees ticks away. According to Halls, the rising fees are causing many parents, including nurses, policemen, and accountants, to reconsider sending their children to the school. This is a trend that Halls believes could have serious consequences for the school's future. While King's College School has received numerous accolades in recent years, including being named the independent school of the year, the school's leadership is clearly aware of the challenges faced in a changing educational landscape. Speaking to The Times, Halls said that the school must be careful not to allow itself to become overly focused on profits at the expense of providing an excellent education to all who can benefit from it. Halls' comments reflect a growing concern among many educators and school leaders about the impact of high fees on local families. As schools become more competitive and draw in more students from wealthy families abroad, there is a danger that local families will be priced out of the market. This has implications not just for individual families but also for the wider community and economy. Ultimately, what can be done to address this issue is still up for debate.

One of the features that has captured their attention is its serrated teeth. It's believed that this was the first terrestrial vertebrate to develop them, which gave it a considerable advantage in hunting. The crocodile-like teeth of the Dimetrodon allowed it to \\"grab and rip and dismember large prey.\\" This was a considerable advantage in the Permian period, where there was a diverse range of prey available. As such, the Dimetrodon was at the top of the food chain. It's interesting to note that the serrated teeth were confined to later species, indicating a gradual change in feeding habits. This evolution is thought to have been the result of changing climates and ecosystems. The Dimetrodon, therefore, is considered a forerunner of mammals. Indeed, the Dimetrodon's anatomy, such as its upright posture and patterns of bone growth, were more mammal-like than reptilian. Its species is also believed to be one of the ancestors of mammals.

The decision was made following concerns over excessive heat during the tournament's original dates in June and July. A vote will be held by FIFA next month in Zurich to decide on the final outcome. UEFA president Michel Platini suggested a winter time frame, with possible dates in January or February being discussed. This would allow players to compete in cooler temperatures and reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses. However, shifting the World Cup to a winter schedule would have major implications for soccer leagues around the world. Many countries have domestic leagues scheduled during that time, and rescheduling would cause disruptions and clashes with other major tournaments. Australia, which was planning to bid for the 2022 World Cup and later lost to Qatar, is seeking compensation for the proposed switch to winter. The country had planned the tournament to occur during Australia's winter, and the change could affect its chances of hosting the tournament in the future. The decision to move the 2022 World Cup to winter has been met with mixed reactions from fans and officials alike. While the change will undoubtedly improve the safety and well-being of players, it comes with logistical challenges and may impact other soccer tournaments and events. The FIFA vote next month will determine the ultimate course of action for the tournament's schedule."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this Note your parents' mood.

The results of the research suggest that there is no definitive standard for male physical attractiveness, and that personal preferences play a significant role in determining what women find desirable in their partners. This highlights the importance of individuality and self-confidence, as opposed to conforming to societal expectations of what an ideal body should look like.

In a healthy relationship, both individuals should be able to express their likes and dislikes without fear of judgement.

The show has evolved and undergone various iterations over the years, with different producers at the helm. The original version of \\"The Price Is Right\\" was produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, two legendary television producers who were responsible for many of the era's most popular game shows. Goodson and Todman created \\"The Price Is Right\\" in 1956, and it ran on NBC until 1965. During its original run, the show was hosted by Bill Cullen, who became one of the most recognizable faces in game show history. The revival of \\"The Price Is Right\\" began in 1972, with Bob Barker as host and Goodson-Todman Productions as the producer. The show was an instant hit, thanks to Barker's charismatic hosting style and the new format, which included audience participation in the form of bidding and game play. The revamped show quickly became a pop culture phenomenon, with contestants and their outrageous antics becoming water-cooler fodder. In 2007, after Barker's retirement, the show underwent another major change. Drew Carey took over as host, and the show's production was taken over by FremantleMedia (formerly known as Pearson Television and later known as Fremantle). Fremantle has continued to produce the show to this day, with Carey at the helm and a new generation of contestants vying for the chance to \\"come on down\\" and win big.

Only 3% of global air travel is from Africa. More international airlines fly to and from African than African airlines.","output":"In recent years, African airlines have been looking towards code-share agreements as a way to improve their network and increase their share of global air travel. Currently, only 3% of global air travel originates from Africa, despite the continent having a population of over 1.3 billion people. One of the major hurdles facing African airlines is the lack of international connections offered by local carriers. While there are certainly a number of airlines based in Africa, many of the world's largest airlines offer more options for travel to and from the continent. This is where code-sharing becomes a valuable tool. By partnering with other airlines, African carriers can expand their network to include more international destinations. This means that travelers in Africa can more easily reach destinations all over the world with only a single ticket and itinerary. While code-share agreements are not a new concept in the aviation industry, they have not been as prevalent in Africa as they have in other regions. This is partly due to a lack of resources and expertise on the part of African airlines. However, as the need for more international connections grows, more carriers are beginning to explore the possibility of code-sharing. Some African airlines have already taken steps in this direction. For example, Ethiopian Airlines has partnered with a number of other airlines to offer more connections to Africa from around the world. Similarly, South African Airways has code-share agreements with a number of airlines that offer flights to and from South Africa. Despite these efforts, there is still a lot of ground to cover. More needs to be done to promote code-share agreements among African airlines, and to encourage international carriers to work with African partners. By doing so, African carriers can help grow their overall share of the global air travel market, and provide more convenient and efficient travel options for passengers."},{"instruction":"Context: Coming off of their road win over the 49ers, the Ravens went home for a Week 6 interconference duel with the winless St. Louis Rams.

Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised?

Ticket validation is important because it confirms that your ticket is legitimate and has not been tampered with. It also helps to prevent fraud and misuse of tickets, which can create unnecessary delays and inconvenience for all passengers. Most train stations have ticket validation machines where you can scan or print your ticket to confirm its validity. Once you've validated your ticket, it's important to ensure that you're heading to the right station and track. Train stations can be quite large and busy, and it's easy to get disoriented or confused if you're not paying close attention. Be sure to double-check your boarding information and ask for assistance if needed. Finally, if you have a reserved seat, make sure that you find the correct seat number. This will help to avoid any confusion or overcrowding on the train. If you're traveling with a group, try to coordinate your seating arrangements in advance to ensure that everyone is seated together. By following these guidelines, you can help to ensure that your train travel experience is safe, efficient, and stress-free. So next time you're planning a trip by rail, be sure to validate your tickets or rail pass, confirm your boarding information, and find your seat if necessary.

One of the most important things to do is to make sure the foot is clean before applying any kind of tape or wrap. This will help prevent any infections from developing.

Applying pre-wrap tape to protect the skin is the next step. This is especially important if the tape is going to be on for an extended period of time or if the skin is prone to irritation. After the pre-wrap tape has been applied, it’s important to apply anchors to hold the tape in place. This ensures that the tape won’t shift or come loose during activity. Applying stirrups to stabilize the ankle is also important as it helps prevent any further damage from occurring. Locking the heels will keep the foot in a neutral position and help prevent any unnecessary movement. Be sure to close any gaps in the tape as this will help ensure a snug fit that won’t cause any discomfort or irritation. Applying a second heel lock over the taped foot ensures that the tape won’t come loose and helps provide additional support. Lastly, it’s important to make sure the ankle isn’t wrapped too tightly.

After analyzing the data from the recent football season, it was determined that quarterback A had a total of 12 touchdown passes in the fourth quarter, while quarterback B only had 10. It is important to note that touchdown passes in the fourth quarter can often be crucial to a team's success. These points can be the difference between a win and a loss, and often require a quarterback to remain focused and composed under high-pressure situations. Quarterback A's ability to perform under pressure was evident throughout the season, as evidenced by their high number of touchdown passes in the fourth quarter. This quarterback's skill in leading their team in crunch time showcases their ability to thrive under difficult circumstances and demonstrates their value to the team. While quarterback B's performance was not as strong as quarterback A's in the fourth quarter, it is important to remember that football is a team sport. The success of a quarterback is often closely tied to the success of their team as a whole. Despite having fewer touchdown passes in the fourth quarter, quarterback B may have contributed in other important ways to their team's success.

In fact, Jones has caught more touchdown passes from Ryan than any other receiver – a total of 58 as of the end of the 2020 season. Another key receiver for Ryan in recent seasons has been Mohamed Sanu. Sanu joined the Falcons in 2016 and quickly established himself as a dependable target for Ryan, especially in the red zone. Over the course of his two and a half seasons with the Falcons, Sanu caught a total of ten touchdown passes from Ryan. In 2018, the Falcons brought in rookie receiver Calvin Ridley, and he wasted no time making an impact. Ridley quickly emerged as a go-to option for Ryan, catching six touchdown passes in his first six games. Over the course of his first three seasons in the league, Ridley has caught a total of 21 touchdown passes from Ryan. Of course, these are just a few of the many receivers who have caught touchdown passes from Matt Ryan over the years. Other notable names include Roddy White, Tony Gonzalez, and Taylor Gabriel.

Siegfried Hecker, former chief of Los Alamos, said he saw hundreds and hundreds of centrifuges operated by an ultramodern control room. The North claims it has 2000 centrifuges and is already producing lowenriched uranium—a claim the Times says could be a negotiating tactic as Kim JongIl hands over the reins, or signal an aggressive shift in its nuclear aspirations.

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.

Son of detained detectives: I'm very proud of their moral standing Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Two foreign corporate detectives based in China have been charged with illegally obtaining private information. The murky corporate laws in China have made it difficult for companies engaged in this line of work. The son of the detained detectives has expressed his pride in their moral standing. The two detectives, whose names have not been released, were arrested in China recently after they were found to have obtained private information illegally. It is not clear what kind of information they obtained, but it is suspected to be related to their corporate detective work. Corporate laws in China are known to be murky, and companies engaged in detective work often face legal challenges. It is not uncommon for such cases to end up in court, and companies may be required to pay heavy fines or face other penalties. The son of the detained detectives, however, has expressed his pride in their moral standing. Speaking to the media, he said that his father and his colleague had always acted with integrity and had never compromised on their values. It is not clear what the future holds for the two detectives, but their case highlights the challenges faced by foreign companies engaged in corporate detective work in China. As the Chinese economy continues to grow, there is likely to be increased demand for such services, and companies will need to be aware of the legal risks involved. In conclusion, the arrest of two foreign corporate detectives in China highlights the murky corporate laws in the country and the legal risks involved in this line of work. While the son of the detained detectives has expressed his pride in their moral standing, the case serves as a warning to companies engaged in this type of work to be aware of the legal challenges they may face."},{"instruction":"ere is a premise: so you don't have to fool with any of that anymore Here is a hypothesis: You won't have to mess with that anymore but you really should.

This helps to avoid any confusion or misinterpretation, especially when dealing with international contexts where different languages may have different abbreviations or nuances. In English, the days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. These names are based on ancient mythology and astrology, where each day is associated with a certain planet or deity. When discussing the days of the week, it is also worth considering the season in which they fall. Depending on where you are in the world, the season can have a significant impact on daily life and activities. For example, Sundays in the summer may be spent at the beach, while Sundays in the winter might be spent indoors by a warm fire. Speaking of seasons, it is essential to know how to ask about the date in Spanish. To do this, you can use the phrase “¿Qué día es hoy?” which translates to “What day is it today?” You can also ask “¿Cuál es la fecha?” which means “What is the date?”. Learning the days of the week, as well as how to reference them without dates, is a fundamental part of language learning.

The game, which was considered a flop and led to the company's downfall in 1983, was famously dumped by truckloads during a 1983 slump.

It involves recognizing and accepting both your strengths and weaknesses, and understanding that they are an integral part of who you are as a person. To accept yourself, it’s important to visualize positive outcomes instead of fearing embarrassment or failure. This means focusing on what you can do, rather than what you can’t. If you feel unsure about taking a certain step, try to imagine the potential rewards that could come from it. This will help you build the confidence necessary to take that step. Second guessing every decision you make can lead to a lack of conviction in the choices you make. Although it’s good to consider all options before taking action, ruminating about every little thing can lead to a paralysis of analysis. Sometimes, in life, we must take risks and move forward despite having doubts. It’s better to make a decision, take action, and learn from the experience than to let life pass us by. When it comes to others’ opinions, it’s important to recognize that not everyone’s judgment should define your sense of worth. Although criticism can help you grow, not all judgments are fair or well-intentioned. Understanding where someone’s judgment is coming from and whether it is constructive can help gauge their input. Ultimately, it’s important to remember that it’s not what others think that defines you, but how you react to their comments. In conclusion, practicing self-acceptance through visualization, avoiding overthinking, and understanding that not all judgments are created equally can lead to a healthier and more fulfilling life. Remember to focus on your strengths and weaknesses and be confident in the choices you make. And finally, don’t let someone else define you – consider their input carefully, but remember that ultimately, you are in charge of your own life."},{"instruction":"Please check if these have the same meaning.
