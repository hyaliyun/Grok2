We also need to define the constraint, which is that the bridge must support a weight of 1000 kilograms. Let's denote the thickness of the steel as 't' (in meters). The volume of the steel used in the bridge will be the product of its dimensions: 10 meters long, 5 meters wide, and 't' meters thick. Therefore, the volume of steel is V = 10 * 5 * t = 50t cubic meters. The cost of the steel per square meter is 500, so the total cost of the steel used in the bridge is C = 500 * V = 500 * 50t = 25000t dollars. Now, we need to consider the constraint that the bridge must support a weight of 1000 kilograms. The strength of the bridge is proportional to its volume. Let's denote the proportionality constant as 'k'. Then, the strength of the bridge is S = k * V = k * 50t. We are given that the bridge must support a weight of 1000 kilograms, so we have the constraint S = 1000. Therefore, k * 50t = 1000. Solving for 'k', we get k = 1000 / (50t). Now, we can rewrite the strength of the bridge as S = (1000 / (50t)) * 50t = 1000. Since the strength of the bridge is fixed at 1000, we can ignore this constraint in our optimization problem. Our objective function is the total cost of the steel used in the bridge, which is C = 25000t. We want to minimize this function with respect to 't'. To do this, we can use the Gradient Descent method. The gradient of the objective function with respect to 't' is dC/dt = 25000. Since this is a constant, the Gradient Descent method will not help us find the minimum value of the objective function. However, we can use the constraint to find the minimum value of 't'. From the constraint k * 50t = 1000, we have t = 1000 / (50k). Since 'k' is a positive constant, the minimum value of 't' occurs when 'k' is at its maximum value. However, we do not have any information about the maximum value of 'k'. Therefore, we cannot find the minimum cost of steel that can be used in the bridge design using the given information and the Gradient Descent method."},{"instruction":"A manufacturing company wants to optimize the production of a certain product.

Initialize x and y with feasible values. For example, x = 0 and y = 0 (no products are produced). 2. Calculate the gradient of the profit function with respect to x and y: ∇P(x, y) = (dP/dx, dP/dy) = (5, 9) 3. Update the values of x and y using the gradient and a learning rate α: x_new = x + α * dP/dx y_new = y + α * dP/dy 4. Check if the new values of x and y satisfy the constraint: 2x_new + 3y_new ≤ 600 If the constraint is not satisfied, adjust the values of x and y accordingly. 5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence (i.e., the change in x and y is very small). However, in this case, the gradient descent method is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, as the objective function is linear and the constraint is also linear. Instead, we can use linear programming or graphical methods to find the optimal solution. Using the graphical method, we can plot the constraint 2x + 3y ≤ 600 and find the vertices of the feasible region. The vertices are (0, 0), (0, 200), and (300, 0).

The profit function can be defined as: Profit(x) = Revenue(x) - Cost(x) Revenue(x) = 20x (since each t-shirt is sold for 20) Cost(x) = 5x + 2000 (since each t-shirt costs 5 to produce and there is a fixed operational cost of 2000) Now, let's find the profit function: Profit(x) = 20x - (5x + 2000) = 15x - 2000 To find the optimal number of t-shirts to produce, we need to find the maximum point of the profit function. We can do this by finding the derivative of the profit function and setting it to zero: d(Profit)/dx = d(15x - 2000)/dx = 15 Since the derivative is a constant and does not depend on x, the profit function is a linear function, and there is no maximum point.

Now we have the optimal number of units Q to minimize the daily cost: Q = 38.994688 (approximately). To find the minimum daily cost, we can plug this value of Q back into the cost function: C(Q) = 1000 + 10 * 38.994688 + 0.2 * (38.994688)^2 C(Q) ≈ 1000 + 389.94688 + 0.2 * 1521.597 ≈ 1000 + 389.94688 + 304.3194 ≈ 1694.26628 So, the minimum daily cost is approximately 1694.27."},{"instruction":"Sure, here's an example numerical problem for a math student to solve: Consider the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5.

Newton's method formula: x_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n) We know that x = 4 is the minimum, so we can use it as the initial guess (x_0) for Newton's method: x_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0) x_1 = 4 - (3(4)^2 - 18(4) + 24) / (6(4) - 18) x_1 = 4 - (48 - 72 + 24) / (24 - 18) x_1 = 4 - (-24) / 6 x_1 = 4 + 4 x_1 = 8 Since x_1 is significantly different from our initial guess x_0, we should iterate the process again: x_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1) x_2 = 8 - (3(8)^2 - 18(8) + 24) / (6(8) - 18) x_2 = 8 - (192 - 144 + 24) / (48 - 18) x_2 = 8 - (72) / 30 x_2 = 8 - 2.4 x_2 = 5.6 We can continue iterating the process until the difference between consecutive x values is very small or negligible. In this case, we can stop here as the difference between x_1 and x_2 is small enough. Step 5: Find the minimum value of the function f(x) at the approximate critical point x = 5.6. f(5.6) = (5.6)^3 - 9(5.6)^2 + 24(5.6) + 7 ≈ -25.344 So, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 7 is approximately -25.344 when x ≈ 5.6."},{"instruction":"A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B.

Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.  Let's find the first derivative of f(x): f'(x) = d/dx(x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9 Now, we need to find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to zero: 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 To solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is possible: 3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 3(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0 So, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3. Now, we need to determine if these critical points correspond to a minimum, maximum, or neither. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative of f(x): f''(x) = d^2/dx^2(x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 6x - 12 Now, let's evaluate the second derivative at the critical points: f''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6 f''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6 Since f''(1) < 0, x = 1 corresponds to a local maximum. Since f''(3) > 0, x = 3 corresponds to a local minimum. Therefore, the function f(x) attains its minimum value at x = 3. Using Newton's method, we would start with an initial guess for the minimum and iterate using the formula: x_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n) In this case, since we already found the minimum analytically, we can confirm that Newton's method converges to the correct value by starting with an initial guess, say x_0 = 2, and iterating: x_1 = 2 - (3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 9) / (6(2) - 12) = 2 - (-3) / 0 = 2 (undefined, division by zero) Newton's method fails in this case because the second derivative is zero at x = 2. However, if we choose a different initial guess, such as x_0 = 4: x_1 = 4 - (3(4)^2 - 12(4) + 9) / (6(4) - 12) = 4 - (33) / 12 ≈ 2.25 x_2 = 2.25 - (3(2.25)^2 - 12(2.25) + 9) / (6(2.25) - 12) ≈ 3.03 x_3 ≈ 2.99 The iterations are converging to x = 3, which is the correct minimum value."},{"instruction":"An oil company wants to create a cylindrical storage tank that can hold the maximum amount of oil possible. The radius of the tank must be between 2 meters and 5 meters, and the height must be between 6 meters and 15 meters. Using Newton's method, what are the dimensions of the tank that will maximize the volume of oil it can hold?","output":"To maximize the volume of the cylindrical storage tank, we need to find the dimensions (radius and height) that will give us the maximum volume. The volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula: V = πr^2h where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. We want to maximize V subject to the constraints 2 ≤ r ≤ 5 and 6 ≤ h ≤ 15. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's introduce a function L(r, h, λ, μ) as follows: L(r, h, λ, μ) = πr^2h - λ(r - 2) - μ(h - 6) where λ and μ are the Lagrange multipliers. We need to find the critical points of L by taking the partial derivatives with respect to r, h, λ, and μ, and setting them equal to zero: ∂L/∂r = 2πrh - λ = 0 ∂L/∂h = πr^2 - μ = 0 ∂L/∂λ = r - 2 = 0 ∂L/∂μ = h - 6 = 0 From the last two equations, we have r = 2 and h = 6. Substituting these values into the first two equations, we get: 4π(2)(6) - λ = 0 π(2)^2 - μ = 0 Solving for λ and μ, we get λ = 48π and μ = 4π. Now, we need to check if this critical point gives us a maximum volume. We can do this by analyzing the Hessian matrix of L: H = | ∂²L/∂r²  ∂²L/∂r∂h |       | ∂²L/∂h∂r  ∂²L/∂h² | Taking the second partial derivatives, we get: ∂²L/∂r² = 2πh ∂²L/∂h² = 0 ∂²L/∂r∂h = ∂²L/∂h∂r = 2πr Evaluating the Hessian matrix at the critical point (r = 2, h = 6), we get: H = | 12π  4π |       |  4π   0 | The determinant of H is: det(H) = (12π)(0) - (4π)(4π) = -16π^2 Since the determinant is negative, the critical point corresponds to a saddle point, not a maximum. However, since we are working with a constrained optimization problem, we need to check the boundary conditions. We have four boundary conditions to check: 1. r = 2, 6 ≤ h ≤ 15 2. r = 5, 6 ≤ h ≤ 15 3. h = 6, 2 ≤ r ≤ 5 4. h = 15, 2 ≤ r ≤ 5 For each of these boundary conditions, we can compute the volume and compare them to find the maximum volume. 1. V = π(2)^2h = 4πh (6 ≤ h ≤ 15) 2. V = π(5)^2h = 25πh (6 ≤ h ≤ 15) 3. V = πr^2(6) = 6πr^2 (2 ≤ r ≤ 5) 4. V = πr^2(15) = 15πr^2 (2 ≤ r ≤ 5) Comparing the volumes for each boundary condition, we can see that the maximum volume occurs when r = 5 and h = 15 (boundary condition 2). Therefore, the dimensions of the tank that will maximize the volume of oil it can hold are a radius of 5 meters and a height of 15 meters."},{"instruction":"Consider the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 3.

We will start with an initial guess (x0, y0) that satisfies the constraints. A suitable initial guess is (0, 0), as it satisfies both constraints. 1. Initialize: k = 0, x0 = (0, 0), r0 = -∇f(x0, y0) = (4, 6), d0 = r0 2.

The feasible region is defined by the intersection of the two constraints: - x^2 - y^2 <= 0 - x + y <= 2 The second constraint can be rewritten as y <= 2 - x. Since x^2 - y^2 <= 0, we have x^2 <= y^2, which implies that y >= x. Combining these inequalities, we have x <= y <= 2 - x. The boundary of the feasible region is given by the equations x = y and y = 2 - x. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find the intersection points: x = y: x^2 - x^2 = 0 => x = y = 0 y = 2 - x: x^2 - (2 - x)^2 = 0 => x = 2/3, y = 4/3 Thus, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices (0, 0), (2/3, 4/3), and (0, 2).

We start with an initial guess of (x, y) = (0, 0) and a tolerance of 0.001. 1. Calculate the gradient at the initial guess: ∇f(0) = 2(0) + 5 = 5 2. Choose the initial search direction, which is the negative gradient: d_0 = -5 3. Perform a line search to find the optimal step size α that minimizes f(x) along the search direction d_0. In this case, we can find the optimal α by setting the derivative of f(x) along the search direction to zero: ∇f(x + αd_0) = 0 2(x - 5α) + 5 = 0 Solving for α, we get α = 1. 4. Update the guess: x_1 = x_0 + αd_0 = 0 - 5(1) = -5 5. Calculate the gradient at the new guess: ∇f(-5) = 2(-5) + 5 = -5 6. Since the gradient is not within the tolerance of 0.001, we need to continue iterating. However, in this case, the gradient is the same as the initial gradient, and the conjugate gradient method will not converge. This is because the function f(x) is a quadratic function, and the conjugate gradient method is not well-suited for solving quadratic optimization problems. Instead, we can solve this problem analytically by finding the critical points of f(x) and checking the boundary conditions. The critical points occur when the gradient is zero: 2x + 5 = 0 x = -2.5 Now, we need to check the boundary conditions. The constraint equation 3x + y = 15 defines a line segment in the xy-plane. The endpoints of this line segment occur when x = 0 and x = 5: x = 0: y = 15 - 3(0) = 15 x = 5: y = 15 - 3(5) = 0 Now, we can evaluate f(x) at the critical point and the boundary points: f(-2.5) = (-2.5)^2 + 5(-2.5) + 6 = 0.25 f(0) = 0^2 + 5(0) + 6 = 6 f(5) = 5^2 + 5(5) + 6 = 56 Since f(5) is the largest value, the maximum of f(x) subject to the constraint occurs at (x, y) = (5, 0), and the maximum value is f(5) = 56."},{"instruction":"A manufacturing company produces two products, product A and product B.

Now, we can plug this value of x back into the original function to find the minimum value: f(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 5 f(1) = 1 - 2 + 5 f(1) = 4 So, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5 is 4, which occurs at x = 1."},{"instruction":"A manufacturing company needs to minimize the cost of producing a certain product.

Define the Lagrangian function L(x, y, z, λ) as follows: L(x, y, z, λ) = 2(xy + xz + yz) + λ(50 - xyz) Now we need to find the critical points of L by taking the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and λ, and setting them equal to zero: ∂L/∂x = 2(y + z) - λyz = 0 ∂L/∂y = 2(x + z) - λxz = 0 ∂L/∂z = 2(x + y) - λxy = 0 ∂L/∂λ = 50 - xyz = 0 We can rewrite the first three equations as: yz = 2(y + z) / λ xz = 2(x + z) / λ xy = 2(x + y) / λ Now, divide the first equation by the second equation: (yz) / (xz) = (2(y + z) / λ) / (2(x + z) / λ) y / x = (y + z) / (x + z) Similarly, divide the second equation by the third equation: (xz) / (xy) = (2(x + z) / λ) / (2(x + y) / λ) z / y = (x + z) / (x + y) Now we have a system of two equations with two variables (x and y): y / x = (y + z) / (x + z) z / y = (x + z) / (x + y) We can solve this system of equations to find the relationship between x, y, and z. From the first equation, we can express z in terms of x and y: z = x(y - x) / (y - x) Substitute this expression for z into the second equation: x(y - x) / (y^2 - xy) = (x + x(y - x) / (y - x)) / (x + y) Simplify the equation: x(y - x) = y(x + x(y - x) / (y - x)) x(y - x)(y - x) = y(x + x(y - x)) x(y - x)^2 = yx^2 Now, we can solve for the ratio x/y: x / y = (y - x) / x 1 / (x / y) = (y - x) / x y / x = x / (y - x) Since both x/y and y/x are equal to the same expression, we can conclude that x = y. Now, substitute x = y into the expression for z: z = x(y - x) / (y - x) z = x So, x = y = z. Now we can use the volume constraint to find the dimensions: V = xyz = 50 x^3 = 50 x = y = z = (50)^(1/3) ≈ 3.684 So, the dimensions of the box that will result in the smallest surface area are approximately 3.684 meters x 3.684 meters x 3.684 meters."},{"instruction":"Consider the function f(x)=x^3-7x^2+10x.

We can solve this problem using integer linear programming, as the products must be whole numbers. However, we can first get an idea of the solution by solving the linear programming problem without the integer constraint. The constraint can be rewritten as y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 3. We can now find the critical points by setting the gradient of the profit function equal to zero: ∇P(x, y) = (5, 4) Since the gradient is constant, there are no critical points within the feasible region.

Instead, we can use the constraint that the company can rent the equipment for a maximum of 30 days to find the optimal values of y and z. If the company rents the equipment for the minimum number of days (1 day), the cost function becomes: f(y, 1) = 20,000 + 100y + 10,000(1) = 30,000 + 100y In this case, the company would need to use as much labor as possible in one day to produce 100 units.

To find the minimum cost, we can compare the costs for different values of z (from 1 to 30) and find the optimal value of y for each z. However, without more information about the relationship between labor hours (y) and the number of units produced (x), we cannot determine the exact minimum cost.

Perturb the current values of the production process parameters by a small random amount.    b. Calculate the new production rate F(P1', P2', ..., Pn') using the perturbed values.    c. If the new production rate is higher than the current production rate, update the current values of the production process parameters to the perturbed values.    d. If the new production rate is lower than the current production rate, update the current values of the production process parameters to the perturbed values with a probability of exp((F(P1', P2', ..., Pn') - F(P1, P2, ..., Pn)) / T).    e. Update the temperature T according to the cooling schedule. After the simulated annealing process is complete, the final values of the production process parameters P1, P2, ..., Pn should be close to the optimal values that maximize the production rate. Note that the simulated annealing method is a heuristic optimization technique, and the quality of the solution depends on the choice of the initial temperature, cooling schedule, and the perturbation function.

Repeat steps 3-6 until the termination criterion is met Step 1: Initialize the population We will generate 10 random values of x within a reasonable range, say -10 to 10. Step 2: Evaluate the fitness of each individual We will calculate the value of f(x) for each individual and use it as their fitness score. Since we are looking for the maximum value, higher fitness scores are better. Step 3: Select parents We will select pairs of parents using the roulette wheel selection method, where individuals with higher fitness scores have a higher chance of being selected. Step 4: Perform crossover and mutation We will perform single-point crossover on the selected parents to create offspring. Then, with a mutation rate of 0.1, we will randomly mutate some of the offspring by adding a small random value to their x-coordinate. Step 5: Evaluate the new population We will calculate the fitness scores of the offspring and combine them with the fitness scores of the parents. Step 6: Replace the old population with the new one We will select the top 10 individuals with the highest fitness scores to form the new population.

The true maximum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 can be found using calculus by taking the derivative and setting it to zero: f'(x) = 2x - 2 = 0, which gives x = 1.

Initialize a population: Generate an initial population of solutions. This can be done randomly, ensuring that each solution meets the constraints. 4. Selection: Select pairs of solutions from the population based on their fitness. Higher fitness solutions should have a higher probability of being selected. 5. Crossover: Apply a crossover operator to the selected pairs of solutions to generate new offspring solutions. For example, you can use one-point crossover, where a random crossover point is chosen, and the offspring inherit genes from both parents. 6.

Step 2: Evaluate the fitness of each solution The fitness function will be the total profit generated by the production levels of products A and B, given the constraints of available resources. For each chromosome, calculate the profit as follows: Profit = (50 * units of product A) + (60 * units of product B) Ensure that the production levels do not exceed the available resources: 5 * units of product A + 20 * units of product B <= 150 (resource 1 constraint) 10 * units of product A + 5 * units of product B <= 100 (resource 2 constraint) Step 3: Select the best solutions for reproduction Choose the chromosomes with the highest fitness values (profits) to be parents for the next generation.

Fitness function: The fitness function is the objective function we want to maximize, which is f(x, y) = 4x + 6y - 2xy. 4. Selection method: Choose a selection method to select parents for crossover. One common method is tournament selection, where you randomly select a few chromosomes and choose the one with the highest fitness value. 5.

One possible crossover operator is the arithmetic crossover, where the offspring is created by taking a weighted average of the parents' genes.

Fitness function: The fitness function is the profit function that we want to maximize. The profit per unit of product A is 60 - 40 = 20, and the profit per unit of product B is 80 - 60 = 20.

Selection: We perform tournament selection by randomly selecting two individuals from the population and choosing the one with the lower fitness (f(x)) as the winner. We repeat this process until we have a new population of the same size (50). 3. Crossover: We perform single-point crossover by randomly selecting pairs of individuals from the new population and applying crossover at a random point in their binary representation. For example, if we have the pair (2, 4), their binary representations are 010 and 100. We could apply crossover at the second position, resulting in the offspring (0, 6). 4.

This individual represents the minimum value of the objective function f(x) and the corresponding value of x. Note that since this is a simple optimization problem with a small search space, it is likely that the genetic algorithm will find the optimal solution (x = 0, f(x) = 0) relatively quickly. However, the genetic algorithm approach is more useful for complex optimization problems with larger search spaces and more complex constraints."},{"instruction":"Consider the following function: f(x) = -x^2 + 6x + 8 Using a genetic algorithm, find the value of x that maximizes the value of f(x). The value of x should lie between -10 and 10, and can have a precision of up to two decimal places.

Generate an initial population of 50 random individuals (x values) between -10 and 10. 2. Calculate the fitness of each individual (f(x)). 3.

Factory X produces 40 units of A and 60 units of B per hour at a cost of 10 per unit of A and 15 per unit of B. Factory Y produces 30 units of A and 20 units of B per hour at a cost of 12 per unit of A and 10 per unit of B. The company wants to maximize profit by determining the optimal production levels at each factory, given a total production time of 4 hours. Use genetic algorithms to determine the optimal production levels and the corresponding maximum profit of the company.","output":"To solve this optimization problem using genetic algorithms, we will follow these steps: 1. Define the problem and constraints 2. Create an initial population 3. Define the fitness function 4. Perform selection, crossover, and mutation 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met 6. Determine the optimal solution Step 1: Define the problem and constraints We want to maximize the profit of the company by determining the optimal production levels at each factory, given a total production time of 4 hours. The constraints are: - Factory X produces 40 units of A and 60 units of B per hour - Factory Y produces 30 units of A and 20 units of B per hour - Cost of producing A at Factory X is 10, and at Factory Y is 12 - Cost of producing B at Factory X is 15, and at Factory Y is 10 - Total production time is 4 hours Step 2: Create an initial population Generate an initial population of chromosomes, where each chromosome represents a possible solution to the problem. Each chromosome will have two genes, one for the production time of Factory X and one for the production time of Factory Y. The sum of these two genes should not exceed 4 hours. Step 3: Define the fitness function The fitness function will be the profit function, which is the revenue minus the cost. The revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of units produced by the selling price of each product. The cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of units produced by the cost per unit. Step 4: Perform selection, crossover, and mutation Select the best chromosomes based on their fitness values, perform crossover to create offspring, and apply mutation to introduce randomness. Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met Continue iterating through the genetic algorithm process until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness value. Step 6: Determine the optimal solution The optimal solution will be the chromosome with the highest fitness value.

The explanation provided here is a high-level overview of the process."},{"instruction":"A clothing company wants to determine the optimal combination of shirt and pants designs to include in its new collection. The company has 5 different shirt designs and 4 different pant designs. Each shirt has a cost of 15 and each pant has a cost of 20. The company wants to make a profit of at least 1000 with this collection. The sales forecast shows that each shirt has a potential profit of 30 and each pant has a potential profit of 40. Using genetic algorithms, what is the optimal combination of shirt and pant designs that the company should include in its new collection to maximize profit?","output":"To solve this problem using a genetic algorithm, we will follow these steps: 1. Define the chromosome representation: A chromosome will be represented as a binary string of length 9, where the first 5 bits represent the inclusion of each shirt design (1 for inclusion, 0 for exclusion) and the last 4 bits represent the inclusion of each pant design. 2. Define the fitness function: The fitness function will be the total profit from the selected shirt and pant designs, considering the costs and potential profits. 3. Initialize the population: Generate an initial population of chromosomes randomly. 4. Perform the genetic operations:    a. Selection: Select chromosomes for reproduction based on their fitness.    b. Crossover: Combine the selected chromosomes to create offspring.    c. Mutation: Randomly change some bits in the offspring chromosomes. 5. Evaluate the new population and repeat steps 4 and 5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a certain number of generations or a chromosome with a profit of at least 1000). After running the genetic algorithm, let's say we find the optimal chromosome to be \\"110110110\\". This means the company should include the first two shirt designs and all four pant designs in its new collection. To calculate the profit, we can use the following formula: Profit = (Number of Shirts * Profit per Shirt) + (Number of Pants * Profit per Pant) - (Number of Shirts * Cost per Shirt) - (Number of Pants * Cost per Pant) Profit = (2 * 30) + (4 * 40) - (2 * 15) - (4 * 20) Profit = 60 + 160 - 30 - 80 Profit = 110 The company will make a profit of 110 with this optimal combination. However, this profit does not meet the desired profit of at least 1000. The company may need to reconsider its sales forecast, costs, or the number of designs to achieve the desired profit."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},U={key:1};function W(i,e,h,c,a,s){const m=p("PoemCard");return o(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>a.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,a.searchQuery]]),a.searchQuery?(o(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>a.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):u("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(o(!0),n(g,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,x)=>(o(),b(m,{key:x,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),n("div",I,' No results found for "'+l(a.searchQuery)+'".
