Gold wird traditionell als sichere Anlage und Wertaufbewahrungsmittel betrachtet, insbesondere in Zeiten wirtschaftlicher Unsicherheit. Es wird auch in der Schmuckindustrie und in geringerem Umfang in der Elektronik und Zahnmedizin verwendet. Seine Rolle im Finanzsektor bleibt voraussichtlich stark, und Zentralbanken halten Goldreserven als Teil ihrer Devisenreserven. Silber hat eine breitere industrielle Anwendung, einschließlich Elektronik, Solarenergie, Medizin und vielen anderen Sektoren, da es sowohl leitfähig als auch korrosionsbeständig ist. Die Nachfrage nach Silber könnte steigen, wenn die Industrien, die es verwenden, wachsen, vor allem Bereiche wie erneuerbare Energien und Technologien, die Silber in Photovoltaik-Solaranlagen und anderen elektronischen Geräten nutzen. Im Kontext der Energiewende und der zunehmenden Digitalisierung könnten sich für Silber neue Verwendungsmöglichkeiten ergeben, was die Nachfrage in der Zukunft eventuell stärker beeinflussen könnte als es bei Gold der Fall ist. Allerdings ist der Preis für Silber volatiler, da er stärker von den industriellen Zyklen abhängt. Langfristige Investoren, die an einer Absicherung gegen Währungsrisiken und Inflation interessiert sind, könnten weiterhin Gold bevorzugen. In der Zwischenzeit könnten Investitionen in Silber attraktiv sein für diejenigen, die auf eine steigende Nachfrage aufgrund von technologischen Innovationen und Industriewachstum wetten. Es ist wichtig anzumerken, dass die Preise von Gold und Silber auch durch eine Vielzahl von Faktoren beeinflusst werden, einschließlich geopolitischer Ereignisse, Inflationsraten, Währungsschwankungen und Minenproduktion. Prognosen sind daher mit Unsicherheiten behaftet und sollten sorgfältig abgewogen werden."},{"instruction":"Sollte man lieber in silberbarren oder silbermünzbarren investieren?","output":"Wenn man in Silber investieren möchte, stehen einem grundsätzlich Barren (auch Bullionbarren genannt) und Münzbarren (oder Anlagemünzen) zur Auswahl. Die Entscheidung, ob man in Silberbarren oder Silbermünzbarren investieren sollte, hängt von mehreren Faktoren ab, darunter persönliche Präferenzen, Investitionsziele und Kostenüberlegungen. Hier sind einige Unterschiede und Überlegungen: 1. **Größe und Flexibilität**: Silberbarren gibt es in einer Vielzahl von Größen, von einem Gramm bis zu mehreren Kilogramm. Dies kann Vorteile bieten, wenn man große Mengen Silber lagern möchte. Münzbarren oder Anlagemünzen sind in Standardgrößen erhältlich, was sie möglicherweise für kleinere Investitionen oder für Anleger, die Flexibilität beim späteren Verkauf wünschen, attraktiver macht. 2. **Prämien und Kosten**: Anlagemünzen haben in der Regel höhere Prämien über dem Spotpreis von Silber als Barren. Sie werden oft für ihr Design, ihre historische Bedeutung oder ihre Seltenheit geschätzt und können Sammlerwert besitzen. Barren hingegen sind typischerweise näher am spotpreis gekoppelt, was sie zu einer kosteneffizienteren Wahl für Investitionen in reines Silber macht. 3. **Liquidität**: Silbermünzen, insbesondere bekannte Münzen wie der amerikanische Silver Eagle oder der kanadische Maple Leaf, können leichter zu liquidieren sein, da sie weltweit anerkannt und geschätzt werden. Barren erfordern möglicherweise eine genaue Prüfung bei Wiederverkauf, insbesondere wenn sie von weniger bekannten Münzstätten stammen. 4. **Speicherung und Sicherheit**: Große Barren sind oft effizienter zu lagern als eine entsprechende Menge an Münzen, allerdings können große Barren auch schwerer zu handhaben sein. Bei der Lagerung sind auch Aspekte der Sicherheit zu bedenken, da Silber ein physisches Gut ist und entsprechend sicher gelagert werden muss, um Diebstahl zu verhindern. 5. **Steuerliche Aspekte**: In manchen Ländern gibt es Unterschiede im Hinblick auf Steuern für Barren und Münzen. So können etwa Anlagemünzen in einigen Rechtssystemen von der Mehrwertsteuer befreit sein, während auf Barren die volle Mehrwertsteuer anfällt. Für eine wohlüberlegte Investitionsentscheidung sollte man nicht nur die oben genannten Punkte, sondern auch die eigene Anlagestrategie, den Anlagehorizont und die Risikotoleranz berücksichtigen. Es kann zudem ratsam sein, sich von einem Finanzberater oder einem Experten für Edelmetallinvestitionen beraten zu lassen, um eine Entscheidung zu treffen, die zu den persönlichen finanziellen Zielen passt."},{"instruction":"wie heißt das verb das das spalten von holz beschreibt?","output":"Das Verb, das das Spalten von Holz beschreibt, lautet \\"spalten\\".

역시, 먼저 와서 시나리오 점검하려고?” “그렇겠죠. 단단한 표정만 봐도 딱 알겠구만 뭘. 그나저나 오디션 때 우진씨가 상대역 연기 봐준 거 봤어요?” “당연히 봤죠. 그날 스탭들 전부 진짜 완전 뒤집어졌었잖아요.” ‘거머리’ 오디션 때에 강우진이 보인 상대역 연기 때문인지, 대본리딩 세팅을 서두르는 수십 스탭들의 시선들이 따가웠다. 추가로 입장하는 키스탭과 영화사, 배급사 관계자들의 시선 역시 비슷했다. “강우진씨가 와있네? 대본리딩 시작하기 1시간 정도 남지 않았나?” “소문 들어선 겉으론 깡깡한데 속은 은근 말랑말랑하나 봐요.” “의외네······울트라급 이슈들도 터지고 솔직히 오디션 때 분위기 씹어먹어서, 은근 콧대 좀 세울 거 같았는데.” “아- 오디션 때 우진씨가 상대역 봐주면서 난리 났다고 하더라고요?” 눈빛이 따갑다. 오디션 때 힘을 좀 더 뺐어야 했나? 아니, 나름 뺀다고 했잖아? 긴장감이 슬슬 몸집을 키워선지 우진은 아랫배에 알싸함이 느껴졌다. ‘방구 마렵네.’ 소리 없는 살포가 가능하겠지만, 언젠가 과거의 실수가 상기된 우진이 묵묵하게 괄약근에 힘을 줬을 때였다. “안녕하세요, 우진씨.” 한소진이 등장했다. 내내 혼자 있던 우진은 그녀가 은근 반가웠다. 마음 같아서는 비죽 웃으며 외로웠다 말하고 싶었으나 컨셉질에 가로막혔다. ‘이분, 저번에 오디션 때도 느꼈는데 미모가 미쳤긴 해.’ 하지만 한소진은 묘하게 성깔이 있었다. “네. 그래서 더 확고해졌어요. 우진씨를 넘어서고 싶어졌어요, 꼭.” 아니, 이 여자는 왜 날 볼 때마다 이긴다 넘어선다 선포하는 거여? 전쟁광이신가? 우진은 그냥 대충 넘기기로 했다. 그렇게 시간이 흐를수록 배우들이 추가됐다. 많은 조연 배우, 진재준, 오희령 등 강우진의 컨셉질 역시 더더욱 진해졌다. 솔직히 긴장감이 팽배할 땐 누가 말 안 거는 게 더 편했다. 쎈척을 등에 업으면 사람들이 약간 기피하는 경향이 있기에 편했다. 그쯤. -스윽. 자연인. 아니, 대배우 심한호가 등장했다. 거친 아우라를 뿜으며 우진의 앞으로 직진하는 그. 강우진은 위엄있게 일어났지만, 속으로는 바로 앞 심한호를 보곤 화들짝 놀랐다. ‘헐?!! 와- 씨, 뭐지? 심한호님 포스 지리네!!’ 꺼끌하게 자란 수염도 그렇고 전체적인 심한호의 이미지가 확 변했다. 수컷의 향이 훌훌 풍겼다. 원래도 범 같은 느낌인데 외면까지 이러니까 딱 맹수 같은 에너지를 흘린다. 그에게 반한 우진이 목소리를 깔았다. “안녕하십니까, 선배님.” 심한호의 답변은 무겁고 짧았다. “오늘 내 연기가 좀 사나울 수도 있지 싶어요.” 강우진은 순수하게 감탄했다. 와, 대사가 무슨 영화네! 따위의 반응. 물론, 속으로. 맹수나 수컷의 향이 진해서인지 심한호의 지금 멘트가 너무 찰떡이었다. ‘존멋. 이게 대배우의 아우라지!’ 오진다 오져. 심한호의 포스를 눈앞에서 구경할 수 있다니. 더불어 우진은 배워야겠다고 생각했다. 저 무게감이나 분위기 같은 거. 심한호는 컨셉질이 아닌 진짜배기였지만, 지금의 형태를 기억해두면 차후 쎈척에 유용하게 써먹을 수 있을 것 같아서였다. 이젠 강우진의 차례. 워낙 강대한 아우라를 목격해서일까? 강우진은 오기가 생겼다. 바로 앞의 이 맹수에게 최고의 컨셉질을 보여주고자 하는 마음. 극한의 뻔뻔함을 얼굴에 깔고 목소리를 저 바닥까지 떨어트리자. 마음이 동하니 급작스레 추진력이 생겼다. 근데 뭐라고 답하지? 연기가 사납다고 했으니까- ‘제가 잘 조련해보겠습니다?’ 아무리 그래도 그건 오바였다. 결과적으로 우진은 약간의 거만함과 예의를 챙겼다. “예, 잘 받아보겠습니다.” 앞뒤 없이 안쪽 꽉 찬 직구로 질러버렸다. 강우진은 일단 평정심을 유지하려 마인드 컨트롤을 되새겼다. ‘아오- 씨, 흔들리지 마.’ 여기서 눈을 피하는 건 하수다. 세상 차가운 톤으로 답한 우진은 대배우 심한호의 눈을 피하지 않았다. 뒤로 잠시간의 공백. “······” “······” 강우진도, 심한호도 입 여는 것 없이 시선을 주고받을 뿐이었다. 차분한 심한호의 안광. 그는 찐 맹수, 우진은 눈속임을 위해 털을 바싹 세운 모양새. 하지만 이 리딩장의 그 누구도 이를 알아차리진 못했다. 지금껏 차곡차곡 쌓아온 착각의 빌드업 덕분. 뭐가 됐든 리딩장은 삽시간에 살얼음판으로 변질됐다. 거대한 긴장감이 출렁였다. 수십 스탭들은 서로 눈치를 살폈고 배우들은 벙찐 얼굴을 유지했다. 와중, 우진과 심한호의 건너편에 선 한소진은 내면으로 비명을 지르고 있었다. ‘아니! 가, 강우진! 진짜 저런다고?!! 심하게 직진이잖아???!’ 당연히 꼿꼿한 우진을 향한 괴성이었다. 그녀의 눈엔 맹수와 괴물이 스산하게 으르렁대는 것처럼 보였으니까. 아니, 근데 저런 게 어떻게 가능하지? 심한호는 배우판의 전설 중의 전설이었다. 그 안가복 감독도 한 수 접고 들어갈 정도. 그러나 강우진은 일말의 꺾임이 없다. 이때. “어머.” 한소진의 오른쪽에 앉은, 묘하게 웃는 오희령이 작게 읊조렸고. “당차네?” 눈 커진 한소진이 어렵사리 되물었다. “······네?” “우진씨 말이야. 처음 보는 캐릭터같지 않니?” “아-” “저 심한호 선배 기세를 눈앞에서 보면 주눅 들기 마련인데 쟤는 그냥 평온하네~ 해외파 출신이라던데 진짠가봐?” “에? 해외파요?” 한소진이 착각의 늪에 발을 들였을 쯤, 리딩장 입구 쪽에 모인 기자들의 수군댐이 커졌다. “워- 뭔 일이래? 특종인가? 찍어야 되나?” “미쳤어? 저거 담았다가 퇴출 당할라고?” “어, 어쨌든 말려야 되잖아. 왜들 가만히 있는 거여.” 순간. “처음 본 상황에 얼어붙은 게지.” 기자들 뒤쪽에서 늙은 목소리가 침투했다. 어느새 도착한 노장 안가복 감독이었다. 그의 등장에 기자들은 이구동성으로 외칠 뻔했다. “아! 감독···” 하지만 끊겼다. 안가복 감독이 검지를 입에 댔으니까. 그런 그가 다시금 리딩장 안쪽 강우진과 심한호를 바라봤다. 안가복 감독의 주변엔 조감독 포함 스탭이 대여섯 함께였고, 전전긍긍한 조감독이 목소리를 죽이며 끼었다. “감독님, 제가 중재하겠습니다. 사고 나겠어요.” 허나 안가복 감독은 여유 묻은 미소와 함께 고개를 저었다. “저 괴물들 신경전에 괜히 끼어들었다가 우리 등만 터지지.” “······예?” “그냥 두라는 얘기야.” “그, 그래도.” “신사적인 현장보단 정글이 나아.” 반면, 조감독과 스탭들은 안절부절못했다. 이에 침착하라는 듯 안가복 감독이 손짓했다. “괜찮아, 둬도 돼. 저게 오히려 배우들에게 불을 지를 테지. 강우진은 ‘거머리’ 연기에 기준점을 정립했고, 심한호는 ‘거머리’의 시작점에서 기폭제를 살포한 게야. 두 투톱 주연의 신경전. 이만한 각성제가 또 어딨나?” 곧, 안가복 감독이 검지로 두 괴물을 찔렀다. “보라고, 이 현장에서 저 둘만 ‘박하성’과 ‘윤정배 회장’이지 않은가?” 후로. 모두가 지켜보는 가운데 녹진한 눈빛을 교환하던 강우진과 심한호 중, 먼저 긴장을 깬 것은 맹수의 탈을 쓴 심한호였다. “잘 받아보겠다라-” 수염 꺼끌한 그가 돌연 딱딱한 얼굴에서 미약한 미소를 보였다. 어쩌면 흥미가 섞인 것처럼도 보였다. “단 1초의 생각도 없이 바로 답하는구만. 배울 점이 많아.” “잘 부탁드린다는 의미였습니다.” “나도 그래요.” “감사합니다.” “나야말로.” 이때야 서늘하던 신경전이 끊겼다. 강우진이 작게 고개를 숙였고, 인사를 받은 심한호가 천천히 움직여 우진의 반대편 자리로 이동했다. 의자를 빼낸 심한호에게 웃음을 머금은 오희령이 말했다. “선배, 시작부터 허리띠 너무 졸라매는 거 아니에요? 봐봐, 애들 다 굳었잖아요. 어후- 추워라.” 심한호가 묶은 장발 머리를 풀며 중후한 목소리를 냈다. “해야 할 말을 했을 뿐이야.” 오희령은 말짱했지만 대부분의 배우들은 긴장을 풀지 못했다. 특히, 세 번째 자리인 한소진은 실제 정신없이 눈알을 굴릴 정도였다. 이런 중압감 넘치는 상황을 타파한 것이. “다들 왔는가?” 타이밍 맞춰 입장한 안가복 감독이었다. 짧은 흰 머리의 그는 모두의 인사를 받으면서도 0자 형 책상의 상석에 앉았다. 곧, 리딩장 전체를 훑는 안가복 감독. ‘거머리’의 수십 배우들, 스탭들, 영화사와 배급사 관계자들. 얼추 백여 명이 넘는 인원들을 천천히 바라보던 안가복 감독이. -스윽. 잔잔히 읊조렸다. “시작합시다.” 동시에 기자들이 사진기를 올렸고, 리딩장 곳곳에 배치된 카메라들 역시 구동됐다. 대본리딩의 스타트는 역시 소개부터. “‘윤정배 회장’역의 심한호 배우님.” 물론, 핸들링은 안가복 감독이 맡았다. “‘박하성’ 역의 강우진 배우님.” 공기는 대체로 무겁다. “‘유현지’ 역의 오희령 배우님.” 짧은 소개와 배우들의 인사. 그것이 얼추 30분 이상은 이어졌고, 끝으로 상석에 앉은 안가복 감독의 소개까지 끝난 뒤. -팔락. 안가복 감독이 ‘거머리’ 시나리오의 첫 장을 펼쳤다. 배우들은 물론, 0자 테이블을 둘러싼 모두도 같았다. 리딩 중 지문과 참여하지 않은 배우의 대사는 안가복 감독이 맡는다. “1, 박하성의 독백.” 강우진이 배우 중 가장 먼저 입을 열었다. 당연히 ‘박하성’을 끌어올린 뒤였다. “이젠 모르겠어요, 내가 누군지. 누구로서 존재하는 건지. 길을 잃었어요······” 퍽 긴 독백이었다. 그러나 그 누구도 자세에 흐트러짐이 없다. 전부는 우진의 독백을 집중해서 듣는다. ‘거머리’의 주제를 관통하는 목소리기에. 이어 씬 교체. 연출로서 보여지는 컷은 안가복 감독의 멘트로 얼추 넘어갔다. 한 장 또 한 장. 약 시나리오 3장이 넘어갔을 쯤 강우진이 다시금 입을 열었다. ‘박하성’의 초반 인생을 들여다보는 씬이기에. 대사를 주고 받는 건 강우진과 안가복 감독. 대략 15분 정도가 지나서야 다른 배우들도 등장했다. 계속해서 미소를 머금었던 오희령이 순간 에너지를 싹 바꿨다. ‘유현지’에 돌입한 것. 과연 대배우급의 베테랑이었다. 평소의 그녀는 보이지도 않았다. 오희령 주변에 맴도는 공기도 판이했다. 안가복 감독의 지문 설명 후 강우진과 오희령의 첫 만남이 이루어졌다. 허나. “······” “······” 둘의 대사는 없다. 애초 두 배우는 끝까지 수어로만 대화하기에 당연했다. 말은 없지만 두 손은 바빴다. 하지만 그저 수어만 보이는 건 아니었다. 상체의 움직임, 시선, 표정, 눈코입의 변화 등. 강우진과 오희령은 감정으로만 상황을 전달해야 했고, 당연하겠지만 어색함 따위 존재치 않았다. 진재준, 한소진 외의 배우들은 충격을 받는다. ‘수준이 높다. 수어만······하는데도 상황이 이해돼. 표정과 표현이 대사를 대체하고 있는 거겠지.’ ‘강우진- 돌겠네, 박하성에 수어가 있어서 혹시나 했는데, 연기도 터무니없으면서 수어까지 저렇게 수준급으로 한다고?’ 정확하게는 안가복 감독을 제외한, 이 리딩장에 모인 전체가 같았다. 생소한 수어, 무서우리만큼 집중한 두 배우, 높디높은 연기의 질. 그리고. “음? 누구야, 자네는?” 수염이 까끌한 심한호가 입을 열었다. ‘윤정배 회장’이 입장한 것. 반대편 강우진을 바라보는 그. 현재의 모습은 거칠기 짝이 없지만, 심한호가 뱉는 대사에는 맹수의 톤이 일절 없었다. 도리어 재치가 섞였고 부드럽다. 문제는. -스윽. 그의 눈이었다. 입은 웃고 있으나 눈에는 오묘한 광기가 숨어 있었다. 호흡 역시 평화롭게 느껴지나 순간순간 어긋날 때가 있었다. “아내와 잘 좀 놀아줘. 꼬시지는 말고.” 언뜻 위험해 보이지는 않지만 위협이 도사린다. ‘윤정배 회장’의 근본이 지켜지면서도 등 뒤로 칼을 쥐고 있다. 현재 우진을 보는 심한호의 연기가 딱 그랬다. 하지만 두드러지지는 않았다. 강우진, 심한호, 오희령. 리딩을 잇는 세 배우는 마치 속을 숨긴 괴물들처럼, 각자의 심정을 가린 채 거짓된 입을 벌려댔다. 스탭들은 소름이 돋았다. ‘으- 뭐냐, 대체.’ 분명, 시나리오 안 대사를 치고 있을 뿐인데, 배경은 그리 변한 게 없는데, 이상하게도 세 배우의 연기가 거듭될수록 스산함이 번졌기 때문이었다. 이어, 다시금 씬이 바뀌었다. 윤정배 회장이 박하성에게 첫 딜을 치는 컷. “목표는 하나야. 일단은 내 아내가 자네에게 의지하게 만들어, 맹목적으로.” “······해보겠습니다.” 이쯤 박하성은 아직 본인의 본질을 파악하기 전이었다. 그렇기에 지레 겁을 먹는다. “그, 근데 의지- 하게 만든다는 건 잘 모르겠습니다. 심지어 맹목적이라는 건······더더욱이 어려울 것 같습니다.” 여기부터였다. 심한호가 사납게 굴기 시작한 것은. “쉽게 해 그럼.” 우진을 보는 심한호가 눈을 크게 키웠다. 꺼끌한 수염이 자린 입 근방이 움찔움찔했다. 능구렁이 같은 톤은 유지되지만, 얼굴 전체의 형태는 뭐랄까 미친 사람과 흡사했다. 광기와 광폭의 중간쯤. 이는 분명, 안가복 감독이 창조한 윤정배 회장과 달랐다. 근본은 지키지만 그 근본을 넘나드는 행태가 자연스럽다. 지배욕이 바닥에 깔린 광대 같기도 했다. “그게 마인드의 차이거든? 네가 어떻게 보는지에 따라 달라질 뿐이야. 응? 그 패배감 가득한 시선부터 바꾸라고.” “······” 윤정배 회장이 강우진을 공격한다. “눈치챘으려나? 네가 이 차를 탄 순간, 너의 목숨줄은 내 손에 달려 있거든?” “예??!” “다 들었잖아? 따고 배짱은 안 되지. 살고 싶지? 그럼 기를 쓰고 마인드를 바꿔.” 서슴없다. 하지만 강우진도 전혀 밀리지 않는다. 아니, 그는 처음부터 그 자리 그대로였다. “마인드······제가 회장님과 같은 세상에 살고 있다는 마음이면 되는 겁니까?” “헷갈리면 안 되고. 월세 정도로 생각해. 신분이라는 건 빨아도 빨아도 구정물이 나오는 거거든.” “월세론 어렵습니다. 전세로 생각할게요.” “크크, 역시- 네가 정답이었어. 적당히 검은 게 마음에 들어. 대신에 선을 넘지 마, 알았나?” “확실히 그어주신다면.” “내 집에 들어오는 순간 알게 돼. 너는 내 아내를 지배하고, 나는 널 지배하고.” 이 순간 혼 빠진 표정을 지은 한소진은 그저 멍하니 들을 수밖엔 없었다. “······” 괴물들의 싸움이었으니까. 한편, 아파트처럼 보이는 한 작업실. 거실 중앙에 모인 책상. 얼추 다섯은 거뜬히 앉아도 될 정도였지만, 책상엔 노트북을 치는 여자 한 명만이 앉아 있었다. -타닥, 타다닥. 호리호리한 체형에 동그란 안경을 낀 그녀. 바로 최나나 작가였다. 평소 소심한 성격인 그녀였지만, 지금의 기백은 남달랐다. 노트북 화면을 보는 눈동자는 빛났으며 타자 치는 손가락엔 자신감이 가득했다. 그로부터 약 1시간 정도. 정신없이 노트북을 두드리던 최나나 작가가 급작스레 고개를 천장으로 올리며. “하아-” 긴 한숨을 뱉었다. “끝났다아.” ‘이로운 악’의 마지막 화 집필이 끝났다는 얘기였다. < 질풍 (5) > 끝","output":"< Gale (5) > Kang Woojin felt a slight tremble when he first arrived at the 'Leech' reading session. Even more so because he was the first to arrive, which meant he was alone to learn. Although he had done quite a few script readings before, and that wasn't a problem, being in a new environment or among new people always made immediate adaptation difficult. It was especially so because it had been quite a while since he had done a script reading. \\"Ugh, it's so awkward being all alone here. Won't someone come already?\\" Of course, Woojin tried to hide his pounding heart by putting on a stern look and pretending to be absorbed in the script with an air of sophistication, but it was impossible to concentrate. Today, his exterior and interior were exceptionally different. \\"Isn't the size of the reading room a bit too large??\\" Director An Gabok, the pinnacle of the Korean film industry, was present, and the actors participating were all top-notch and leading stars. And then. \\"Woojin, you came really early? As expected, did you come first to check the script?\\" \\"That must be it. You can tell just by his serious expression. By the way, did you see Woojin's acting during the audition?\\" \\"Of course, I did. That day, all the staff were completely flipped out.\\" Perhaps because of the performance Kang Woojin showed during the 'Leech' audition, the gazes of the dozens of staff members setting up the reading session were sharp. The gazes of the key staff, film company, and distribution company representatives who entered later were similar. \\"Kang Woojin is here? Isn't there about an hour left before the script reading starts?\\" \\"I heard rumors that he's tough on the outside but surprisingly soft on the inside.\\" \\"That's unexpected... With all the ultra-level issues that have erupted, and honestly, since he dominated the atmosphere during the audition, I thought he'd be a bit more arrogant.\\" \\"Ah, did you hear about the commotion when Woojin helped with the acting during the audition?\\" The gazes were piercing. Should I have held back more during the audition? No, I did hold back, didn't I? As the tension slowly grew, Woojin felt a tingling sensation in his lower abdomen. 'I feel like farting.' He could probably let out a silent fart, but recalling a past mistake, Woojin silently tensed his sphincter. \\"Hello, Woojin.\\" Han Sojin appeared. Woojin, who had been alone all this time, was somewhat glad to see her. He wanted to smile wryly and say he was lonely, but his act prevented him. 'This person, I felt it during the audition, but her beauty is insane.' However, Han Sojin had a peculiar temperament. \\"Yes. That's why I became more determined. I want to surpass you, Woojin, no matter what.\\" Why does this woman always declare victory or surpassing me whenever she sees me? Is she a warmonger? Woojin decided to just let it slide. As time passed, more actors joined. Many supporting actors, including Jin Jaejoon and Oh Heeryung, and Kang Woojin's act became even more intense. Honestly, when the tension was high, it was more comfortable not to talk to anyone. If you pretend to be tough, people tend to avoid you a bit, which was convenient. At that moment. -Swish. A natural person. No, the great actor Shim Hanho appeared. With a rough aura, he headed straight towards Woojin. Kang Woojin stood up with dignity, but inside, he was startled by Shim Hanho right in front of him. 'Huh?! Wow, what's this? Shim Hanho's presence is amazing!!' His roughly grown beard and the overall change in Shim Hanho's image were striking. The scent of a male wafted through the air. He already had the feeling of a tiger, but now with this exterior, he exuded the energy of a wild beast. Woojin, charmed by him, lowered his voice. \\"Good day, senior.\\" Shim Hanho's response was heavy and brief. \\"My acting might be a bit wild today.\\" Kang Woojin purely admired him. Wow, his lines are like from a movie! That kind of reaction. Of course, internally. Whether it was because of the scent of a beast or a wild animal, Shim Hanho's current line was just perfect. 'So cool. This is the aura of a great actor!' It's amazing, it's awesome. To be able to witness Shim Hanho's presence up close. Additionally, Woojin thought he needed to learn from him. That sense of weight and atmosphere. Although Shim Hanho was the real deal, not just an act, remembering this form would be useful for pretending to be tough in the future. Now it was Kang Woojin's turn. Perhaps because he had witnessed such a powerful aura? Kang Woojin felt a surge of determination. He wanted to show the best act to this wild beast right in front of him. He put on the ultimate brazenness on his face and dropped his voice to the bottom. When his heart was moved, suddenly he gained momentum. But what should he answer? Since he said his acting was wild, should he say, 'I'll try to tame it well?' No matter how you look at it, that would be overdoing it. In the end, Woojin managed to keep a bit of arrogance and politeness. \\"Yes, I'll take it well.\\" He threw a straightforward fastball without hesitation. Kang Woojin then reminded himself to maintain his composure. 'Ah, don't get shaken.' Here, avoiding eye contact would be amateurish. Woojin, who responded with a cold tone, did not avoid the gaze of the great actor Shim Hanho. A brief silence followed. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" Both Kang Woojin and Shim Hanho exchanged glances without saying a word. The calm light in Shim Hanho's eyes. He was a real wild beast, while Woojin was just puffing up his fur for deception. However, no one in the reading room noticed this. Thanks to the buildup of delusions accumulated over time. Whatever the case, the reading room quickly turned into a thin ice rink. A huge tension rippled. The dozens of staff members looked at each other, and the actors maintained their stunned faces. Meanwhile, Han Sojin, standing across from Woojin and Shim Hanho, was screaming inside. 'No! Kang Woojin! Is he really doing that?! He's going straight for it??!' Of course, it was a scream directed at the upright Woojin. To her eyes, it seemed like monsters and wild beasts were growling eerily. No, but how is that even possible? Shim Hanho was a legend among legends in the acting world. Even Director An Gabok would take a step back for him. But Kang Woojin showed no sign of faltering. At this time. \\"Oh my.\\" Oh Heeryung, sitting to the right of Han Sojin, murmured with a strange smile. \\"Isn't he bold?\\" Han Sojin, with widened eyes, struggled to ask back. \\"......Yes?\\" \\"Woojin. Doesn't he seem like a character you've never seen before?\\" \\"Ah-\\" \\"He's facing Shim Hanho's presence right in front of him, and anyone would be intimidated, but he's just calm~ They say he's from overseas, maybe it's true?\\" \\"Eh? From overseas?\\" As Han Sojin stepped into the swamp of delusions, the murmurs of the reporters gathered at the entrance of the reading room grew louder. \\"Wow- What's going on? Is it a scoop? Should we take pictures?\\" \\"Are you crazy? If you capture that, you want to be kicked out?\\" \\"Well, we have to stop it anyway. Why is everyone just standing there?\\" Suddenly. \\"It's just that they're frozen because it's their first time seeing such a situation.\\" An old voice penetrated from behind the reporters. It was Director An Gabok, who had arrived unnoticed. At his appearance, the reporters were about to shout in unison. \\"Ah! Director···\\" But they stopped. Director An Gabok had put his index finger to his lips. Then he looked back inside the reading room at Kang Woojin and Shim Hanho. Around Director An Gabok were about half a dozen staff members, including the assistant director, who nervously whispered. \\"Director, I'll mediate. There's going to be an accident.\\" However, Director An Gabok shook his head with a relaxed smile. \\"Don't interfere with those monsters' psychological warfare, or we'll be the ones to get hurt.\\" \\"......Yes?\\" \\"Just leave it.\\" \\"But, still.\\" \\"It's better to have a jungle than a gentlemanly scene.\\" Meanwhile, the assistant director and staff members were restless. As if to calm them, Director An Gabok gestured. \\"It's okay, let them be. That will probably ignite the actors. Kang Woojin has established a benchmark for 'Leech' acting, and Shim Hanho has become the catalyst at the starting point of 'Leech.' A psychological battle between the two top leads. What better stimulant could there be?\\" Soon, Director An Gabok pointed at the two monsters with his index finger. \\"Look, aren't those two the only ones who aren't 'Park Ha-sung' and 'Chairman Yoon Jung-bae' in this scene?\\" Afterward. While everyone watched, the intense psychological battle between Kang Woojin and Shim Hanho, who had been exchanging deep gazes, was broken by the wild beast disguised as Shim Hanho. \\"I'll take it well-\\" The bearded Shim Hanho suddenly showed a faint smile on his rigid face. It seemed as if he was somewhat intrigued. \\"Answering without a second thought. There's a lot to learn.\\" \\"It was meant to say I look forward to working with you.\\" \\"Me too.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" \\"Likewise.\\" Only then did the chilly psychological battle end. Kang Woojin bowed slightly, and Shim Hanho, who had received the greeting, slowly moved to the seat opposite Woojin. As Shim Hanho pulled out a chair, Oh Heeryung, with a smile, said. \\"Senior, aren't you tightening your belt too much from the start? Look, all the kids are stiff. Oh, it's cold.\\" Shim Hanho, untying his long hair, let out a deep voice. \\"I just said what needed to be said.\\" Oh Heeryung was unfazed, but most of the actors couldn't relax. Especially Han Sojin, in the third seat, was literally rolling her eyes in a frenzy. It was. \\"Has everyone arrived?\\" Director An Gabok, who entered at the right timing, was the one who broke the overwhelming atmosphere. The short-haired man sat at the head of the O-shaped table, receiving greetings from everyone, and then slowly scanned the entire reading room. Director An Gabok looked slowly at the dozens of actors, staff members, film company and distribution company representatives of 'Leech.' There were over a hundred people in total. -Swish. He murmured quietly. \\"Let's begin.\\" At the same time, the reporters raised their cameras, and the cameras placed around the reading room also started operating. The start of the script reading naturally began with introductions. \\"Actor Shim Hanho in the role of 'Chairman Yoon Jung-bae'.\\" Of course, Director An Gabok was in charge of handling. \\"Actor Kang Woojin in the role of 'Park Ha-sung'.\\" The atmosphere was generally heavy. \\"Actor Oh Heeryung in the role of 'Yu Hyun-ji'.\\" Short introductions and greetings from the actors. This went on for about 30 minutes or more, and after the introduction of Director An Gabok, who was sitting at the head of the table, was finished. -Flap. Director An Gabok opened the first page of the 'Leech' script. Everyone around the O-shaped table did the same. Director An Gabok was responsible for the narration and lines of actors not participating in the reading. \\"1, Park Ha-sung's monologue.\\" Kang Woojin was the first among the actors to speak. Naturally, it was after he had brought up 'Park Ha-sung.' \\"I don't know anymore, who I am. Who I exist as. I've lost my way......\\" It was a rather long monologue. However, no one showed any signs of discomfort in their posture. Everyone was focused on Woojin's monologue. Because it was a voice that penetrated the theme of 'Leech.' Then the scene changed. The cut shown by the director was roughly passed with Director An Gabok's comments. One page after another. About three pages of the script had passed when Kang Woojin spoke again. It was a scene looking into the early life of 'Park Ha-sung.' The dialogue was between Kang Woojin and Director An Gabok. After about 15 minutes, other actors also appeared. Oh Heeryung, who had been smiling all along, suddenly changed her energy. She entered into 'Yu Hyun-ji.' Truly a veteran of great actor caliber. The usual her was nowhere to be seen. The air around Oh Heeryung was completely different. After Director An Gabok's narration, the first meeting between Kang Woojin and Oh Heeryung took place. However. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" There were no lines between the two. Since the two actors were supposed to converse only in sign language until the end, it was natural. There were no words, but their hands were busy. It wasn't just sign language that was visible. Movements of the upper body, gaze, facial expressions, changes in the eyes, nose, and mouth. Kang Woojin and Oh Heeryung had to convey the situation only with emotions, and of course, there was no awkwardness. Actors like Jin Jaejoon and Han Sojin were shocked. 'The level is high. Just with sign language...... I understand the situation. The expressions and expressions are replacing the dialogue.' 'Kang Woojin- it's crazy, Park Ha-sung has sign language, and I was worried, but he's doing sign language at such a high level along with his outrageous acting?' Precisely, except for Director An Gabok, everyone gathered in this reading room felt the same. The unfamiliar sign language, the two actors focused to a frightening extent, the high quality of acting. And then. \\"Hm? Who are you?\\" Shim Hanho, with his prickly beard, spoke. 'Chairman Yoon Jung-bae' had entered. Looking at Kang Woojin on the opposite side, his current appearance was as rough as it could be, but there was no tone of a wild beast in the lines Shim Hanho uttered. Instead, they were witty and soft. The problem was. -Swish. His eyes. His mouth was smiling, but there was a mysterious madness hidden in his eyes. His breathing seemed peaceful, but there were moments when it was off. \\"Play well with my wife. But don't seduce her.\\" It didn't seem dangerous at a glance, but there was a threat lurking. 'Chairman Yoon Jung-bae' maintained his essence while holding a knife behind his back. Shim Hanho's current acting towards Woojin was exactly like that. However, it wasn't prominent. Kang Woojin, Shim Hanho, Oh Heeryung. The three actors continuing the reading were like disguised monsters, hiding their true feelings and opening their false mouths. The staff got goosebumps. 'Uh- what is this?' Clearly, they were just delivering lines from the script, and the background hadn't changed, but strangely, as the three actors' performances continued, a chill spread. Then, the scene changed again. The cut where Chairman Yoon Jung-bae makes his first deal with Park Ha-sung. \\"The goal is one. For now, make my wife rely on you, blindly.\\" \\"......I'll try.\\" At this point, Park Ha-sung had not yet grasped his essence. Therefore, he is prematurely scared. \\"But, about relying- I don't quite understand. Especially blindly...... it seems even more difficult.\\" From here, Shim Hanho began to act fiercely. \\"Then make it easy.\\" Shim Hanho, looking at Woojin, widened his eyes. The prickly beard around his mouth twitched. The tone was like a slippery snake, but the overall shape of the face was similar to that of a madman. Somewhere between madness and fury. This was definitely different from the Chairman Yoon Jung-bae created by Director An Gabok. The essence was maintained, but the behavior that crossed that essence was natural. He seemed like a jester with a desire for control at the bottom. \\"That's the difference in mindset, you see? It all depends on how you see it. Huh? Start by changing that look full of defeat.\\" \\"......\\" Chairman Yoon Jung-bae attacks Kang Woojin. \\"Did you notice? The moment you got in this car, your life was in my hands.\\" \\"What??!\\" \\"Didn't you hear? You can't have guts and no courage. Want to live? Then change your mindset with all your might.\\" He's relentless. But Kang Woojin doesn't back down at all. No, he had been in that place from the start. \\"Mindset...... Do you mean I should think I live in the same world as the chairman?\\" \\"Don't get confused. Think of it as rent. Status is like dirty water that keeps coming out no matter how much you wash it.\\" \\"Rent is difficult. I'll think of it as a lease.\\" \\"Ha, exactly- you were the right choice. I like that you're just dark enough. But don't cross the line, got it?\\" \\"If you draw it clearly for me.\\" \\"The moment you enter my house, you'll know. You will dominate my wife, and I will dominate you.\\" At this moment, Han Sojin, with a drained expression, could only listen blankly. \\"......\\" It was a battle of monsters. Meanwhile, in a workroom that looked like an apartment. A desk gathered in the center of the living room. It was big enough for about five people to sit comfortably, but only one woman was typing on a laptop at the desk. -Tap, tap, tap. The woman with a slender figure and round glasses was none other than writer Choi Nana. She was usually timid, but her spirit at the moment was exceptional. Her eyes shone as she looked at the laptop screen, and her fingers typing were full of confidence. About an hour later. Writer Choi Nana, who had been frantically typing on her laptop, suddenly raised her head to the ceiling and let out a long sigh. \\"Haah-\\" \\"It's done.\\" It meant that the last episode of 'Beneficial Evil' had been completed. < Gale (5) > End"},{"instruction":"< 질풍 (9) > 장소는 전주. ‘거머리’의 거대한 세트장이 있는 곳. 현재도 역시 백여 명 스탭들이 몰려 있었지만, 어째선지 모두들 점심식사 전 컵라면을 즐기고 있었다. 1인 1컵라면은 아니었다. 너덧 명씩 모여 컵라면 하나를 나눠 먹는다. 서서, 앉아서, 팀별로 등등. 장소도 각양각색이었다. 잔디 마당에 둘러앉아 있는 팀이나 간이 의자에 모인 스탭들도 보인다. 공통점은 어디서나 후르릅 소리가 들린다는 것. “으으음! 뭐야, 이거! 맛있는데요??” “맞죠? 대존맛! 와- 이거 지금 팔고 있어요??! 바로 사야겠다!” “못 살걸? 기사 보니까 오픈런 터지고 줄 서고 난리도 아니던데? 근데 우진씨! 이거 대박 맛있습니다!” “진짜 뭐랄까- 예상을 벗어나는 맛이다. 생각보다 자극적이라 더 좋아요.” 거의 모든 스탭들이 극찬을 쏟아냈다. 물론, 대배우 심한호나 오희령, 진재준, 한소진 외의 배우들도 마찬가지. “음- 좋군. 이거라면 매일 먹을 수도 있겠어.” “선배. 그게 다야? 난 너무 맛있는데? 우진씨가 만든 거라 더 그런 것 같아.” “하하하. ‘우리네 식탁’ 보면서 계속 무슨 맛일까 했는데! 고마워요, 우진씨. 근데 컵라면 말고 진짜는 맛보기 힘들겠지?” “어머, 소진아. 국물 원샷 하려고?” “아, 아니······저도 모르게. 하- 망했다. 식단 해야 되는데.” “먹어먹어, 그거 얼마나 된다고. 감독님! 어떠세요??” 흰머리 자욱한 안가복 감독은 약간 커진 눈으로 손에 들린 컵라면을 내려보고 있었다. “······컵라면인데 이런 깊은 맛이 날 수도 있는 건가?” 그의 눈엔 파도가 치고 있었다. 다분히 놀란 얼굴이었다. 이렇듯 ‘거머리’ 팀 전부가 맛보고 있는 컵라면의 뚜껑 표지엔 당연하겠지만. -‘김자반 막국수’ 컵라면 강우진의 창작 요리가 타이틀로 박혀 있었다. 표지 디자인은 간단했다. 진짜 ‘김자반 막국수’의 이미지가 그대로 삽입됐다. 그중에서 눈에 띄는 건. “이 포즈는 우진씨가 직접 아이디어 낸 거예요??” “이야- 우진님이 이런 포즈도 취하네.” “우진씨! 찐 쌍엄지 보여주시면 안 돼요??” “이렇게 보면 뭔가- 상상이 딱 안 되긴 해.” 뚜껑을 장식한 강우진의 쌍엄지였다. 명확하게는 근엄한 쌍엄지. “하하하! 근데 보통 이런 거는 웃으면서 하지 않나??? 너무 진지한 쌍엄지라 더 웃음 포인튼데??” “그게 킬포죠! 무표정 쌍엄지!” “먹으라는 건지 말라는 건지 헷갈리는데??!” “이거 촬영할 때 화나셨던 건 아니죠?” “근데 은근 눈길 확 잡지 않아요? 나만 그런가.” ‘거머리’ 현장이 매우 핫하다. 이미 모두의 시선은 강우진에게 쏠렸다. 그는 여느 때와 다름없이 무심함 최대치였다. 그저 작게작게 스탭들의 물음에 답해줄 뿐. “별 생각 없이 찍었습니다.” 허나, 알맹이 강우진은 극한의 고통을 겪는 중이었다. ‘아오- 씨! 튈까? 일단 튀고 봐?? 개쪽팔린데 진짜?!’ 그만해. 내 근엄한 쌍따봉을 더이상 수면 위로 올리지 말란 말이다. 민망함이 속된말로 떡상한다. 극한의 뻔뻔함으로 얼굴에 철판을 깔곤 있지만, 컵라면에 버젓이 박힌 자신의 쌍엄지가 계속 아른거렸으니까. 웃긴 건 농신 측에선 저 근엄한 쌍엄지가 최고라며 극찬을 아끼지 않았다는 것. 강우진씨의 이미지가 제대로 표현됐다나 뭐라나. 그래도 실수다. 저건 빼달라고 했어야 했다. ‘하, 미친. 저 병신같은 쌍따봉이 전국에 깔린다고???!’ 이미 판매는 시작됐다. 컨셉질이 그 어느 때보다 치열한 강우진은 잠시잠깐 해외로 튈까? 싶은 고민을 진지하게 했다. 그것도 잠시. “자-” 맛의 감격은 뒤로한 안가복 감독이 현실로 돌아왔다. “슬슬 정신 다잡자고.” 쉬는 시간은 끝. 촬영에 돌입하자는 지시. 평소에도 그랬지만, 특히 오늘은 여유를 부릴 수 없었으니까. “내일 백상도 있으니까 말이야.” 한편. 본격적으로 판매를 시작한 ‘김자반 막국수’는 대중들에게도 그랬지만, 강우진의 주변인들에게도 적잖은 파도를 일으켰다. 예를 들어 화린. 집 거실에 앉은, 헤어밴드로 머리를 올린 그녀는 두터운 대본을 보면서도 초조해하고 있었다. 대본은 당연하겠지만. -‘이로운 악’/ 2화 최근 송만우 PD에게서 받은 ‘이로운 악’이었다. -팔락. 화린은 대본 보는 것에 집중하는 척하지만 진짜는 따로 있었다. 대본을 보면서도 탁자 위에 올려진 컵라면을 힐끔댄다. ‘김자반 막국수’였다. 강우진에게 받은 것이 아닌, 집 주변 편의점에서 화린이 직접 줄 서서 사 온 것. 물을 부어둔 채인지 김이 뚜껑 사이로 풀풀 올라온다. 화린이 핸드폰을 들어 시간을 확인했다. “1분 남았어, 1분.” 정확히 1분 뒤, 그녀가 젓가락을 들곤 컵라면에 훅 붙었다. “천천히- 조심히.” 냄새를 길게 맡은 화린이 제일 처음 한 작업은 컵라면 뚜껑을 조심히 뜯는 것이었다. ‘상처 나면 안 돼.’ 이유야 간단했다. 최최최애의 근엄한 쌍엄지를 어떻게 참나? 덕질하는 팬으로서 뚜껑에 삽입된 강우진의 쌍엄지를 수집하기 위함이었고. -스윽. 천천히 뚜껑을 뜯은 화린이 삽인된 쌍엄지 우진을 보며 작게 웃었다. “존귀.” 조심스레 뚜껑을 옆에 둔 그녀가 컵라면을 음미했다. 사실, 그녀는 ‘우리네 식탁’에서 우진의 진짜 ‘김자반 막국수’을 맛보긴 했었다. 그래서인지 더 확실한 맛 평가가 가능했고. “오- 대박. 진짜 좀 비슷한데? 맛있어.” 곧, 시원하게 흡입하기 시작했다. 다이어트 중이지만 팬심을 위해 내일 굶기를 선택한 것이었다. “이거 좀 잔잔해지면 몇 박스 사놔야지.” 내일이 백상 시상식이라 열량 소비는 극심하겠지만 뒤늦은 덕질이 더 무섭다고, 화린의 전투력은 그 어느 때보다 강인했다. 강우진의 불알친구들도 조용하진 않았다. 점심시간에 맞춰 회사 주변의 대형마트에 도착한 이경성이 제일 빨랐다. “워- 미, 미친!” 배가 더욱 나온 이경성은 마트에 도착하자마자 입을 쩍 벌렸다. 라면 코너에 걸린 표지판과. -‘김자반 막국수’ 판매처 최소 30명은 거뜬히 넘어 보이는 기다란 줄이 보였으니까. 현재도 속속 추가된다. 이경성은 헛웃음과 함께 일단 현 상황을 찍어서 단톡방에 올렸다. 이 기상천외한 장면을 어떻게 참나? 그리곤 줄을 서는 인파에 섞이는 이경성. 이쯤 단톡방이 시끄러워졌다. -이경성: D마트 실시간 상황 -이경성: (사진) -나형구: 아닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅁㅊ?? 진짜냐 이거?!! 돌았넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -김대영: 여기 편의점도 똑같음 -이경성: 몇 분만에 내 뒤로 10명 줄섬ㅋㅋㅋㅋ이러다가 못 사는 거 아니냐?? -나형구: 일 끝나고 집에 가면서 살라고 했는뎈ㅋㅋㅋㅅㅂ나약한 생각이었네? -나형구: 발매되자마자 품귀현상 지리네......우진! 강우진! 본인 거니까 뭐 남는 거 없냐?! 적선 좀 해줘라! -김대영: (사진) 난 성공. 강우진의 쌍따봉이 매우 인상적 -강우진: 사지마 쌍따봉 찍지마! 하지말라고 -김대영: 안 되지 잘 모아놨다가 대대손손 물려줄 거다. 이게 내 친구의 모습이라고. 당연히 우진의 팬클럽 회장인 동생 강현아와 무리들도, 강우진과 친한 배우들도. 아니, 국내 전체가 ‘김자반 막국수’로 요동친다. 예견된 흐름이긴 했다. 20% 시청률을 수성 중인 ‘우리네 식탁’과 강우진의 이슈력이 만들어낸 현상. 거기에 ‘농신’ 측의 SNS 또는 수많은 너튜버들의 광고 등으로 뿌린 마케팅 홍보가 힘을 보탰다. 『[이슈픽] 강우진 컵라면, ‘김자반 막국수’ 판매 시작과 함께 품귀현상?』 그 뒤를 언론이 따라붙고. 『편의점마다 ‘김자반 막국수’를 사기 위해 줄 선 사람들, 컵라면에도 오픈런을 만든 강우진』 여론이 부채질한다. -우리집 앞에 편의점 미친 상황ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -오늘자로 풀린 강우진 김막(김자반 막국수) 오픈런 ㅗㅜㅑ -야 ㅁㅊ 강우진 컵라면 사러 왔는데 대기줄 실화냐???!!! -김막 오픈런ㅋㅋㅋㅋ씹 -아ㅅㅂ 내 눈앞에서 강우진 컵라면 다 팔림.... -김막 오픈런 ㅈㄴ웃기넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -아 시바 또 초반 물량 조절하는거냐?? 대박의 흐름이었다. 다음 날, 3월 18일. 목요일. ‘백상예술시상식’이 열리는 당일. 느지막한 아침이었다. 시간은 11시쯤. 강우진은 서울 쪽 도로 위의 밴에서 찾을 수 있었다. 그는 현재 샵으로 이동 중. “······” 우진은 단단한 얼굴로 핸드폰을 내려보고 있었다. 직전까지는 숱한 축하 연락들을 확인했고, 지금은 ‘김자반 막국수’ 컵라면의 상황을 확인하고 있었다. ‘미쳤네······맞냐 이거??’ 사태가 본인 생각보다 심각해서인지 강우진은 순수하게 놀라고 있었다. 아니, 그 누가 이런 사태를 상상해보겠는가? ‘오픈런- 이건 뉴스에서나 보던 거라고.’ 허나 우진은 오늘 다른 스케줄에 신경을 쏟아야 했다. 오늘은 종일 ‘백상예술시상식’ 관련을 소화해야 할 테니까. 후로. 청담동 샵에 도착한 강우진이 헤어와 메이크업 등, 본격적인 멋 챙기기가 끝난 뒤. “타, 우진아. 가자.” 모든 준비를 마친 강우진이 밴에 올랐다. “예, 대표님.” 같은 날, 늦은 오후. 삼성동 코엑스. 성대하게 열릴 ‘백상예술시상식’은 코엑스에서 진행될 예정이었다. 정확한 장소는 D홀. 코엑스의 야외 광장엔 이미 백상예술시상식’ 로고와 각종 협찬 기업들의 로고판이 양쪽 벽처럼 깔렸고, 그 중심에 기다란 레드카펫이 쭉 깔린 상태. 레드카펫의 양쪽으로 수백 명 기자들이 몰렸다. -파바바박! -파바바바박!! 끝없이 들리는 셔터음. 이미 스타들의 행진은 시작된 참이었으니까. 그런 기자들 주변으론 각종 매체의 인원들, 방송국, 시상식 관계자들이 머릿수를 더했고, 그들을 팬들과 구경꾼들이 감쌌다. 턱 봐도 장관이었다. 수백은 가뿐한 어마무시한 인파가 레드카펫의 시작부터 끝까지 가득했다. “지현씨!! 안녕하세요, 지현씨!!” “꺄아아악!! 언니!! 손 좀 흔들어 주세요!!!” “이쪽!! 이쪽 좀!” “손하트! 손하트 좀 부탁합니다!!” 열기가 하늘을 찔렀다. 규모로 따지면 청룡 때보다 더 거대했다. 그럴 만했다. 청룡은 영화인들의 축제라면, 백상은 영화는 물론 TV 쪽을 같이 아우르는 시상식이니까. 영화, 드라마, 예능, 연극에 관련된 모든 배우와 방송인, 개그맨 등 연예인들이 모두 모인다. 당연히 사이즈가 몇 배는 클 수밖에. 그렇게 시간이 갈수록 백상의 레드카펫 행사는 뜨겁고 질펀해졌다. 작년 예능 판을 뒤흔든 국민 MC도 등장했고, 연극판에서 두각을 보인 배우들도 나타났다. 예능의 블루칩 개그맨도 수줍게 인사를 하며 행진한다. 다들 턱시도나 정장 또는 드레스로 의상에 퍽 신경을 쓴 모습. 와중 수백명은 거뜬한 기자들은 속속 도착하는 연예인들을 찍으면서도, 어제오늘 크나큰 이슈를 형성한 배우를 기다리고 있었다. “아- 씨, 언제 오는 거여? 이미 들어간 거 아닌가?” “아니야. 난 여기 레드카펫 시작하기 전부터 있었는데, 강우진 머리털도 못 봤어.” “확실해, 박기자?” “어. 곧, 오겠지.” 강우진이었다. 이미 레드카펫을 스친 많은 탑들도 군침을 흘릴 만했지만, 현재 수백 기자들이 바라는 얼굴은 단연 강우진일 수밖엔 없었다. 연예계에 등장한 순간부터 단 한시도 안 팔린 적이 없는 괴물 배우. 지금 이 시각에도 화제성의 화력이 폭발하는 중이니까. 그 순간. “아!! 강우진씨!!!” 레드카펫 초입에 있는 기자들이나 리포터 등이 과하게 부산스러워졌다. 이유야 간단했다. 네이비 톤의 턱시도를 입은, 흥분이 점철된 현장과는 달리 냉정한 얼굴인 강우진이 나타났으니까. 플래시가 터지는 속도가 가히 수배는 늘어난다. -파바바바박!! 고함과 괴성 내지는 비명이 레드카펫 전체로 번지기 시작했다. “강우진씨!! 인사 좀 해주세요!! 인사!!!” “이쪽 보고 손 좀! 우진씨!!” “컵라면 대박 나신 것 같은데!! 기분 어떠세요!!” “우와!! 강우진, 강우진이다!!” “꺄아아악! 오빠!! 여기 좀 봐주세요!!!” “우진씨!! 오늘 어떤 상을 받을 거 같나요!!??” 고막이 멍멍해질 정도의 데시벨이었다. 살짝 무섭게도 느껴질 정도. 그러거나 말거나 어마어마한 수의 사람들은 서로 얽히고설켜 강우진에게 달려들었다. 사이사이 선 덩치 좋은 가드들이 힘겨워하는 게 표정에 절절히 담긴다. 반대로 강우진은. “······” 포커페이스를 유지하면서도 적당히 호응했다. 눈이 멀 정도의 플래시를 참으며 손을 흔들고, 비명 지르는 팬들과 시선을 맞추며 괴성에 짧게 답하기도 한다. 차분하다. 그러나 겉으로만 그랬고 내면은 흥분 중이었다. ‘귀 찢어지겠네! 이거 청룡 때보다 몇 배는 더 모인 거 아닌가??! 와- 씨, 돌았네. 플래시 때문에 앞이 안 보인다, 앞이!’ 청룡 이후 간만에 경험하는 시상식이었다. 첫 경험 때처럼 심장이 터질 듯하진 않았지만 그래도 강우진은 긴장감은 팽배했다. 집중된 관심이 두근거림을 더욱 키운다. 컨셉질이 진한 우진은 정신을 똑바로 잡아야 했다. 발이 꼬여 넘어지기라도 하면 바보같이 보일 테니까. 하지만 그건 현실로 나타났다. -턱. 순간, 스텝이 꼬인 우진이 앞으로 휘청했으니까. < 질풍 (9) > 끝","output":"< Gale (9) > The location was Jeonju, where the massive set of 'Leech' was located. Even now, about a hundred staff members were gathered, but for some reason, everyone was enjoying cup noodles before lunch. It wasn't one cup noodle per person. Groups of several people shared one cup noodle. Standing, sitting, by teams, etc. The locations varied as well. Teams sitting around on the grass lawn or staff gathered on temporary chairs were also seen. The commonality was the slurping sound heard everywhere. \\"Umm! What is this! It's delicious??\\" \\"Right? Super delicious! Wow- is this for sale right now??! I need to buy it immediately!\\" \\"You probably can't. Didn't you see the article? There was a mad rush and long lines. But Woojin! This is seriously amazing!\\" \\"It's really, how should I say- unexpectedly delicious. I like it because it's more stimulating than I thought.\\" Almost all the staff members were pouring out praise. Of course, the same went for the great actors Shim Hanho, Oh Heeryung, Jin Jaejoon, Han Sojin, and others. \\"Mm- nice. I could eat this every day.\\" \\"Senior. Is that all? I find it so delicious. Maybe because Woojin made it.\\" \\"Hahaha! I kept wondering what it would taste like while watching 'Our Dining Table'! Thank you, Woojin. But it's hard to taste the real thing besides cup noodles, right?\\" \\"Oh my, Sojin. Are you going to down the broth in one shot?\\" \\"Ah, no... I didn't realize. Ah- I'm doomed. I need to stick to my diet.\\" \\"Eat, eat, how much could it be. Director! How is it??\\" Director An Gabok, with his white hair, was looking down at the cup noodle in his hand with slightly widened eyes. \\"......Can cup noodles have such a deep flavor?\\" His eyes were filled with waves. His face was clearly surprised. As such, the cup noodle that the entire 'Leech' team was tasting, naturally had on its lid cover. -'Kimjaban Makguksu' Cup Noodle Kang Woojin's creative dish was emblazoned as the title. The cover design was simple. The image of the real 'Kimjaban Makguksu' was inserted directly. Among them, what stood out was. \\"Did Woojin come up with this pose himself??\\" \\"Wow- Woojin can strike such a pose.\\" \\"Woojin! Can you show us the real double thumbs up??\\" \\"Looking at it like this- it's hard to imagine.\\" It was Kang Woojin's double thumbs up on the lid. Specifically, a stern double thumbs up. \\"Hahaha! But usually, don't people smile when they do this??? The serious double thumbs up is even funnier??\\" \\"That's the killer point! The expressionless double thumbs up!\\" \\"Are you telling us to eat it or not??!\\" \\"Didn't you get angry during the shoot?\\" \\"But it really catches your eye, doesn't it? Or is it just me?\\" The 'Leech' set was very hot. Everyone's attention was already focused on Kang Woojin. He was as indifferent as ever, simply answering the staff's questions in a small voice. \\"I took the photo without much thought.\\" However, the real Kang Woojin was experiencing extreme pain. \\"Ah, damn! Should I run? Should I just take off?? It's so embarrassing for real?!\\" Stop it. Don't bring my stern double thumbs up to the surface anymore. The embarrassment was skyrocketing, so to speak. Despite his face being covered with the ultimate brazenness, the image of his double thumbs up stuck on the cup noodle kept haunting him. The funny thing was that the company 'Nongshin' spared no praise for his stern double thumbs up, saying it perfectly represented Kang Woojin's image. Still, it was a mistake. I should have asked them to remove it. \\"Ha, crazy. That stupid double thumbs up is going to be distributed nationwide???!\\" Sales had already started. Kang Woojin, whose concept act was fiercer than ever, seriously considered fleeing overseas for a moment. But that was only for a moment. \\"Alright-\\" Director An Gabok, who had put the taste of delight behind him, returned to reality. \\"Let's get our heads together.\\" The break was over. It was a directive to start shooting. As usual, but especially today, there was no time to relax. \\"Because we have the Baeksang Awards tomorrow.\\" Meanwhile. The 'Kimjaban Makguksu' that had officially started selling caused quite a stir among the public, but also among Kang Woojin's acquaintances. For example, Hwarin. Sitting in the living room with a hairband holding up her hair, she was anxious even while looking at the thick script. The script was, of course. -'Beneficial Evil' / Episode 2 It was the recent 'Beneficial Evil' she received from Producer Song Manwoo. -Flap. Hwarin pretended to focus on the script, but her real focus was elsewhere. Even while looking at the script, she glanced at the cup noodle on the table. It was 'Kimjaban Makguksu.' Not received from Kang Woojin, but bought by Hwarin herself after standing in line at a convenience store nearby. Steam was rising between the lid as she had already poured water into it. Hwarin picked up her phone to check the time. \\"One minute left, one minute.\\" Exactly one minute later, she picked up her chopsticks and dug into the cup noodle. \\"Slowly- carefully.\\" The first thing Hwarin, who took a long sniff of the aroma, did was carefully peel off the lid of the cup noodle. 'I can't get hurt.' The reason was simple. How could she resist her ultimate favorite's stern double thumbs up? As a fan collecting Kang Woojin's double thumbs up inserted in the lid. -Swish. Hwarin, who slowly peeled off the lid, smiled softly at the inserted double thumbs up Woojin. \\"Your grace.\\" She carefully placed the lid aside and savored the cup noodle. In fact, she had tasted the real 'Kimjaban Makguksu' made by Woojin on 'Our Dining Table.' Therefore, she was able to give a more certain taste evaluation. \\"Oh- jackpot. It's really similar, isn't it? Delicious.\\" Soon, she began to slurp it down. She was on a diet, but she chose to fast tomorrow for the sake of her fan heart. \\"I should buy a few boxes once this calms down.\\" Tomorrow was the Baeksang Awards, so she would burn a lot of calories, but late fandom was scarier, and Hwarin's fighting spirit was stronger than ever. Kang Woojin's close friends were not quiet either. Lee Kyungsung, who arrived at the large supermarket near his company in time for lunch, was the fastest. \\"Wow- crazy!\\" Lee Kyungsung, whose belly had grown even more, gaped as soon as he arrived at the supermarket. He saw the sign hanging in the noodle corner and. -'Kimjaban Makguksu' Sales Point There was a long line of at least 30 people. More were joining. Lee Kyungsung chuckled and immediately took a picture of the current situation to post in the group chat. How could he resist capturing this extraordinary scene? Then, Lee Kyungsung joined the crowd in line. Around this time, the group chat became noisy. -Lee Kyungsung: D-Mart live situation -Lee Kyungsung: (Photo) -Na Hyungu: LOL what?? Is this real?!! It's crazy LOL -Kim Daeyoung: The convenience store here is the same -Lee Kyungsung: In a few minutes, 10 more people lined up behind me LOL Are we going to miss out?? -Na Hyungu: I was going to buy some on my way home from work LOL Damn, that was a weak thought? -Na Hyungu: Immediate shortage as soon as it's released... Woojin! Kang Woojin! Since it's your product, don't you have any leftovers?? Give us a little charity! -Kim Daeyoung: (Photo) I succeeded. Kang Woojin's double thumbs up is very impressive -Kang Woojin: Don't buy it, don't take pictures of the double thumbs up! I told you not to -Kim Daeyoung: No way, I'll keep it well and pass it down through generations. This is the image of my friend. Naturally, Kang Woojin's younger sister Kang Hyuna, the president of his fan club, and her group, as well as actors close to Kang Woojin. No, the entire country was shaken by 'Kimjaban Makguksu.' It was a predicted flow. The phenomenon created by the 20% viewership rating of 'Our Dining Table' and Kang Woojin's influence. The marketing promotion spread by 'Nongshin' through SNS and numerous YouTubers also contributed. 『[Issue Pick] Kang Woojin's cup noodles, 'Kimjaban Makguksu' causes shortage as soon as sales start?』 The media followed. 『People line up at convenience stores to buy 'Kimjaban Makguksu,' Kang Woojin creates an open run even for cup noodles』 Public opinion fanned the flames. -The convenience store in front of my house is crazy LOL -Today's release of Kang Woojin's Kim Mak (Kimjaban Makguksu) open run ooh la la -Dude, WTF, I came to buy Kang Woojin's cup noodles and there's a real line???!!! -Kim Mak open run LOL -Ah damn, Kang Woojin's cup noodles sold out right in front of me... -Kim Mak open run is so funny LOL -Ah damn, are they controlling the initial stock again?? It was a blockbuster trend. The next day, March 18th, Thursday. On the day of the 'Baeksang Arts Awards,' it was a late morning. Around 11 o'clock. Kang Woojin could be found in a van on the road in Seoul. He was currently on his way to the salon. \\"......\\" Woojin was looking down at his phone with a stern face. Until just before, he had been checking numerous congratulatory messages, and now he was checking the situation of the 'Kimjaban Makguksu' cup noodles. \\"Crazy... is this real??\\" Kang Woojin was genuinely surprised, as the situation was more serious than he thought. Who would have imagined such a situation? \\"Open run- that's something I've only seen on the news.\\" However, Woojin had to focus on other schedules today. Today, he had to deal with everything related to the 'Baeksang Arts Awards' all day long. Afterward. After Kang Woojin arrived at the salon in Cheongdam-dong and finished his hair and makeup, and all the preparations. \\"Let's go, Woojin.\\" Kang Woojin, who was all set, got into the van. \\"Yes, President.\\" The same day, late afternoon. COEX in Samseong-dong. The grand 'Baeksang Arts Awards' were scheduled to take place at COEX. The exact location was Hall D. The outdoor plaza of COEX was already lined with the 'Baeksang Arts Awards' logo and various sponsor logos on both walls, with a long red carpet laid out in the center. Hundreds of reporters flocked to both sides of the red carpet. -Papapapak! -Papapapapak!! The endless sound of shutters. The march of the stars had already begun. Around those reporters were personnel from various media, broadcasting stations, and awards ceremony officials, adding to the headcount, and they were surrounded by fans and onlookers. It was a sight to behold. Hundreds, easily a massive crowd, filled the red carpet from start to finish. \\"Jihyun! Hello, Jihyun!\\" \\"Kyaaak! Unnie! Please wave your hand!!!\\" \\"This way! This way!\\" \\"Please do a heart with your hands!!\\" The heat pierced the sky. In terms of scale, it was even bigger than the Blue Dragon Awards. It made sense. While the Blue Dragon was a festival for filmmakers, the Baeksang included both film and TV in the awards ceremony. Actors, broadcasters, comedians related to movies, dramas, variety shows, and plays all gathered. Naturally, the size had to be several times larger. As time passed, the Baeksang red carpet event became hotter and more intense. The national MC who shook up the variety show scene last year appeared, and actors who stood out in the theater scene also showed up. The rising star comedian of variety shows also shyly greeted and marched. Everyone was dressed in tuxedos, suits, or dresses, paying great attention to their outfits. Meanwhile, hundreds of reporters, who were easily taking pictures of the arriving celebrities, were waiting for an actor who had made a huge issue yesterday and today. \\"Ah- when is he coming? Has he already entered?\\" \\"No. I've been here since before the red carpet started, and I haven't seen a hair of Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Are you sure, Reporter Park?\\" \\"Yeah. He'll be here soon.\\" It was Kang Woojin. Although many top stars who had already crossed the red carpet were drooling, the face that hundreds of reporters were waiting for was undoubtedly Kang Woojin. A monster actor who has never been unsold since he appeared in the entertainment industry. Even at this moment, his popularity was exploding. At that moment. \\"Ah!! Kang Woojin!\\" Reporters and reporters at the entrance of the red carpet became excessively busy. The reason was simple. Kang Woojin, wearing a navy-toned tuxedo, appeared with a cool face, contrasting with the excited scene. The speed of the flashes increased by several times. -Papapapapak!! Shouts, screams, and cries began to spread across the entire red carpet. \\"Kang Woojin! Please greet us!! Greet!!!\\" \\"Look this way and wave your hand! Woojin!\\" \\"It seems like your cup noodles are a hit!! How do you feel!!\\" \\"Wow!! Kang Woojin, it's Kang Woojin!!\\" \\"Kyaaak! Oppa!! Please look here!!!\\" \\"Woojin! What award do you think you'll receive today!!??\\" The decibel level was enough to make one's eardrums numb. It was almost frighteningly loud. Regardless, the enormous number of people tangled and rushed towards Kang Woojin. The expressions of the sturdy guards in between were filled with struggle. On the contrary, Kang Woojin. \\"......\\" Maintained a poker face while appropriately responding. He endured the blinding flashes, waved his hand, and briefly answered the screaming fans while making eye contact. He was calm. But that was only on the outside, as he was excited inside. \\"My ears are going to burst! Isn't this several times more than the Blue Dragon Awards??! Wow, I'm going crazy. I can't see in front of me because of the flashes, I can't see!\\" It was his first awards ceremony experience since the Blue Dragon Awards. His heart wasn't about to burst like the first time, but Kang Woojin was still filled with tension. The focused attention increased his palpitations. Woojin, who was heavy on concept acting, had to keep his mind straight. If he tripped and fell, he would look like a fool. But that became a reality. -Thud. Suddenly, Woojin, who got tangled up with a staff member, staggered forward. < Gale (9) > End"},{"instruction":"< 백상 (4) > 강우진과 매우 대조적인 이미지를 지닌 남자 참가자. 그것만으로도 그는 송만우 PD의 눈을 사로잡았다. ‘우진씨가 회색이면 쟤는 흰색. 아니, 베이지쯤 되나.’ 굳이 따지자면 강우진은 어둡고 저 참가자는 밝다. 둘이 서 있다면 명암이 확 두드러지겠지. 외모로도 차이가 났다. 우진은 이목구비가 진한 편에 흑발이니까. 관심이 급격하게 동하는 송만우 PD. 여기서 특이한 건. ‘묘한데.’ 분명, 강우진과 대조적임에도 저 참가자는 오묘하게 우진과 닮은 느낌이었다. 나이가 얼추 비슷해서 그런가? 자연스레 송만우 PD는 그의 프로필에 시선을 고정했고, 동시에 앞에 선 첫 번째 남자가 입을 열었다. 목소리 자체는 부드럽지만 자신감이 결여된 톤이었다. “아, 안녕하십니까. 조무찬···입니다.” 조무찬. 뭐가 음성에 힘이 없다. 좋게 말하면 섬세함이 보이고 나쁘게 보자면 맹탕. 그래도 일단은. ‘외모만 보자면- 오늘 오디션 본 애들 중에 1등이겠어.’ 곱상한 외모만 보자면 숱한 엔터들이 달려들고도 남을 정도였다. 어쨌든 조무찬과 적당히 인사를 나눈 송만우 PD가 그의 프로필을 쭉 훑었다. “흠-” 나이 25살. ‘허? 소속사는 없네?’ 예상외였다. 당연히 소속사는 있을 줄 알았던 송만우 PD였다. 조무찬의 프로필은 일반적인 배우 지망생 프로필과는 조금 달랐다. 보통 지망생들은 보출까지도 프로필에 적어낸다. 허나 조무찬의 프로필엔 그런 게 없고 공백이 많다. 대학은 안 다니고 이렇다 할 출연 작품도 없다. 다만 하나. “······전문국 선생님의 연극 극단에 멤버인가?” 연예계서도 유명한 연극 극단의 소속돼 있었다. 질문을 받은 조무찬이 약간 우물우물 답했다. “예?? 아- 예. 여, 열심히 하고 있습니다.” 국민 원로배우로 유명한 전문국. 대한민국 국민이라면 그를 모르는 사람은 없다. 대배우 심한호 보다 한참 선배이며 존재하는 원로배우 중 영향력으로 보면 1등이었다. 그런 그가 운영하는 연극 극단은 상당히 유명했다. 극단 출신 탑배우들이 퍽 수두룩했고, 그 극단이 뒷배라고 하면 연출자들의 눈빛부터 달라졌다. 지금의 송만우 PD도 그랬다. “극단은 언제부터 다녔어요?” “그···20살 때부터 군대 갔다 온 지금까지요.” “어떻게 입단했어요? 여기 극단 들어가는 거 극악이라고 들었는데.” 사실이었다. 왜? 오직 원로배우 전문국의 픽이 있어야만 입단이 가능하니까. “제, 제가 집이 좀 어려워서 대학교 안 가고 일부터 시작했는데요. 연기를 좋아해서 연기 동호회는 했었거든요. 무료 공연할 때 전문국 선생님이 들어오라고 하셔서······” 송만우 PD가 턱수염을 쓸었다. ‘천운이었다는 소리네. 어쨌든 극단 생활을 한 5~ 6년 한 건가? 어쨌든 그 극단의 인원은 많아 봐야 20명 내외라고 들었어.’ 팔짱 낀 송만우 PD가 정면의 청량함 그득한 조무찬을 바라봤다. 반면, 조무찬은 송만우 PD의 시선을 휙 피했다. 누가 봐도 자존감이 낮은 느낌이었다. 유약하다는 표현이 알맞다. 이 역시 강우진과는 전혀 딴판이었다. 그럼에도 저 조무찬은 원로배우 전문국의 눈에 들었고 태산과 같은 뒷배. 아니, 극단이 있다. ‘······즉, 저놈이 전문국 선생님의 직속 제자라는 얘긴데-’ 심지어 그 체면을 중요시하는 전문국이 이 오디션에 조무찬을 보냈다는 것은. ‘검증은 이미 끝났다는 거고.’ 자신이 있다는 얘기였다. 품고 있던 자식을 세상에 내놓은 것은 다 이유가 있겠지. 이어 천천히 고개를 끄덕인 송만우 PD가, 시선을 피해 허공을 보고 있는 조무찬에게 다시 물었다. “극단에 계속 있다가 컨텍받아서 진출했어도 됐을 텐데, 왜 우리 오디션을 선택했어요?” 입을 우물대던 조무찬이 작게 읊조렸다. “강우진님이······제 우상이라서- 입니다.” “활동 경력은 조무찬씨 쪽이 더 많은데?” “전문국 선생님이 경력은 무, 무의미하다고 하셨고 또···그냥 강우진님이 멋있다고 생각합니다!” 유약한 조무찬이 급작스레 목소리에 힘을 넣었다. 거짓이 아니라는 소리다. 그는 진심으로 강우진을 우상으로 여기고 있었다. 이에 송만우 PD가 되물었다. “그 정도면 왜 다른 작품 땐 시도 안 해봤지? 우진씨 작품이 한 둘이 아닌데.” “서, 선생님이 아직 준비가 안 됐다고 하셔서.” “지금은 됐다?” “저도 잘···모르겠어요.” “오케이.” 팔짱을 푼 턱수염 송만우 PD가 검지로 조무찬을 가리켰다. “연기 봅시다.” “······예, 옙!” 오늘 오디션에서 가장 많은 질문을 받은 그가 기어가는 목소리로 말을 이었다. “준비한 연기는, ‘프로파일러 한량’의 ‘유지형’입니다.” 박대리가 아닌 류정민이 맡았던 남주 ‘유지형’을 준비해왔다는 조무찬. 저 아이가 굳이 박대리와 적대적 인물을 가져왔다는 건. ‘······전문국 선생님의 전략인가?’ 아마도 원로배우 전문국도 조무찬이 강우진과 반대되는 이미지라는 걸 잘 알고 있을 터였다. 그러니 준비한 연기도 우진이 했던 배역과 적대적인 것을 들고 왔다고 송만우 PD는 추측했다. 이 순간. -스으. 우물우물하던 조무찬의 몸에 힘이 쭉 빠졌다. 흐물흐물하다. 다만, 유약한 표정이 180도 달라졌다. 주변 공기가 변했다. 그가 ‘유지형’에 돌입한 것이었다. 한량이지만 사이코적인 웃음이 서린다. 좀 전의 자존감 없던 모습은 온데간데없다. 조무찬은 새로운 해석의 ‘유지형’을 가감없이 선보이기 시작한다. 움직임이 유연하며 눈동자가 자유롭다. 순간, 작게 미소를 짓는 송만우 PD. ‘과연.’ 왜 저 조무찬이 깡깡한 원로배우 전문국의 눈에 들었는지 절절히 이해됐으니까. ‘이놈도 천재과야.’ 그리고 칼이었다. ‘전문국 선생님이 잘 벼려낸 칼.’ 휘두를 대상은 명확했다. 같은 시각. 한창 ‘이로운 악’의 오디션이 끝을 향해 달려가고 있을 무렵, 강우진은 전주의 ‘거머리’ 세트장에 복귀한 상태였다. ‘거머리’는 쉴 틈 따윈 없었으니까. “허이- 액션.” 그래도 오전에 안가복 감독 포함 백여 명 스탭들에게 거대한 축하를 받았으며, 심한오나 오희령 외의 배우들에게도 열화와 같은 박수를 받았다. 거의 대부분 백상에 참석한 인원들이었지만 그들은 강우진에게 축하를 아끼지 않았다. 물론, 우진의 주변도 같았다. 백상이 있던 날 밤에 가족들에게 연락이 득달같이 왔으며, 불알친구는 물론이며 지인들 배우들까지도 축하를 쏟아냈었다. 우진의 팬클럽인 ‘강심장’ 역시 팬카페나 각종 SNS에 축하 광고를 게재했다. 백상 최초 신인상과 조연상 동시 수상. 그럴만한 결과였으며 결실이었다. 하지만 컨셉질이 짙은 강우진에게 즐길 시간은 그리 많지 않았다. 곧바로 ‘거머리’의 ‘박하성’으로 열연하기 바빴다. 전율은 그리 길지 못 했다. ‘괴물 배우’인 강우진의 숙명이라면 숙명이었다. 하지만 그와 반대로 세상은 그렇지 않았다. 『‘백상예술시상식’ 종료, 강우진 동시 수상 눈길』 『[영화제]또 사고 쳤다! 작년 ‘8관왕’ 싹쓸이한 강우진, 이번에는 신인상+조연상으로 신기록 수립』 어젯밤인 백상 시상식이 끝난 그 순간부터 천둥 치듯 요동쳤다. 여론, 언론, 각종 매체, 오프라인 모두 말이다. 뉴스에도 등장할 정도였다. “일본 진출과 더불어, ‘김자반 막국수’ 컵라면의 열풍을 만든 배우 강우진씨가 백상 시상식에서 신인상과 조연상 동시 수상을 받았습니다. 처음 있는 일이었습니다. 김예솔 기잡니다.” 원래도 백상이나 청룡에서의 일은 뉴스에도 곧잘 등장하는 편이었는데, 많은 이슈를 등에 업은 강우진의 파란은 뉴스 측에서도 그냥 흘려보내긴 아까운 소재였으니까. 뭐, 언론 쪽은 안 봐도 비디오였다. 『[포토]백상 최초로 동시 수상 기록한 강우진의 ‘쌍따봉’/ 사진』 『2년 차에 유일무이한 기록 수집하는 강우진, 컵라면 품귀현상도 모자라 조연상까지』 백상에서 강우진이 보인 멘트와 더불어 자극적인 소식을 뿌려대기 바빴다. 당연히 각종 포털사이트로 기사들이 도배됐다. 현재도 ‘김자반 막국수’ 컵라면이 품귀현상 흥행으로 판매고를 쭉쭉 올리고 있는 상황. 대중들의 오픈런이 계속되는 가운데, 먹음직스러운 소식이 추가됐으니 어느 언론사가 가만히 있을 수 있겠는가? 『파격적 동시 수상으로 역사 새로 썼지만···강우진은 덤덤, 예상했냐는 질문에 “몰랐다, 중요하지 않다”』 이 흐름은 여론에서 더 빛났다. 블로그, 카페, SNS, 커뮤니티, 너튜브 등등. 강우진의 동시 수상이 없는 곳이 없다. 특히 너튜브와 SNS 쪽은 극성이었다. 정식적인 백상의 영상, 편집본, 강우진만 따로 자른 영상 외의 다수. 대부분의 대중들은 열광한다. -솔까 강우진 대단함 진심으로 한국 연예계 역사를 혼자 바꾸고 있음 -나의 배우 강우진님 최고!!! 신인상+조연상 동시수상 축하드립니다 짝짝짝!! -ㅁㅊ 강우진이 수상소감으로 쌍따봉 날릴 때 지려버렸다 -축하하고!! 사랑해요!!! -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ왘ㅋㅋㅋㅁㅊ진심 조연상으로 강우진 불릴 때 좀 소름돋음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -소위 말하는 연줄없이 본인 스스로 묵직하게 걸어가는 강우진님 항상 응원합니다 -강우진 동시수상으로 대중들 반응 좀 반반이던데 난 받을만 하다고 봄! 솔직히 지금 강우진만큼 이슈력 미친 배우 어딨는데?? -그의 쌍따봉은 역대급 수상소감이었다 -청룡때 내년엔 주연상 받겠다고 선전포고할땐....좀 미친놈인가? 싶었는데....2년 차에 조연상까지 받아버리니까 시바 충분히 가능할 듯 싶음 -대단하다! 아마 다시는 한국 연예계 역사에 강우진 같은 배우는 없을 듯 심지어 아직도 2년차ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ 뭐 대부분이 이랬다. 하지만 역시 부정적인 시선도 만만치 않았다. 『백상 최초 한 획을 그은 강우진, 다만 그의 마무리는 찜찜했다···누리꾼들 “과하게 건방지다”』 백상에서 우진의 동시 수상을 목격한 배우들의 모임이나. “연기 잘하는 거야 아는데- 그래도 2년 차에 조연상까지 받는 건 좀 이상하지 않나?” “그건 나도 동감. 아무리 세상이 변하고 있다지만, 쟁쟁한 선배들이 몇 명이었는데 새파란 놈한테 조연상을 넘겨. 그것도 동시 수상으로.” “작년에 8관왕 받았을 때만 해도 그래, 애가 텐션이 미쳤으니까 이해는 됐는데. 이번 건 좀 별로야.” “백상이 시청률에 미친 거지.” 제작사, 엔터, 방송국 등의 업계 관계자들 사이에서도 비슷했다. “100% 이슈빨로 받은 거지 그건.” “에이- 그래도 한량 때 강우진이 보인 박대리는 인정할 만하죠.” “누가 뭐래? 그래도 전통이 있고 업계 룰이라는 게 있구만, 뭔 2년 차 신인한테 조연상을 주나?” “꼰대네, 꼰대.” “뭠마??” “시장이 변화하고 있다는 증거죠. 선배, 그렇게 고여있으면 썩을걸요??” 대중들도 그랬다. 대부분은 강우진의 실력을 인정하지만, 소수는 우진의 이슈를 먹잇감으로 삼았다. -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ응 뒷돈으로 받은 조연상임 -솔까 인정ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아니 아무리 그래도 한국에 지리는 중견 배우가 몇인데 조연상을 강우진한테 주는 건 에바짘ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -↑ㅂㅅ들ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ니들이 여기서 씨불여봐야 강우진은 하늘 위로 훨훨 난다 -강우진 ㅈㄴ빨아대네, 아무리 걔가 지린다고 해도 뭔 벌써 조연상을 타냐?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ백상 내부적으로 조사해봐야됨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 어디든, 어느 곳이든. -어휴 등신들ㅋㅋㅋㅋ백날천날 키보드나 두들겨랔ㅋㅋㅋㅋ자다가 인생 지 인생 되돌아 보면서 훌쩍훌쩍 눈물이나 흘리면서 프로 불편러는 존재하는 법이었다. 지금껏 강우진이 걸어온 길에도 늘 있었다. 그저 우진에겐 딱히 타격이 없었을 뿐이었고, 강우진은 같은 방법으로 반격하지 않고 실력과 결실로 응수했다. 지금도 전부를 무시하며 오직 연기에 치중하고 있지 않은가? 일반적인 배우라면 상처가 날지 모르겠으나, 알맹이가 따로 존재하는 강우진에겐 그 어떤 흠집도 낼 수 없었다. 뭐가 됐든 국내에 터진 화산은 늦은 밤까지 유지됐고, 전주의 ‘거머리’ 세트장에 켜진 조명들 역시 똑같았다. 퍽 컴컴한 밤임에도 촬영을 이어가고 있었으니까. “컷, 재준씨 다시 한번 갑시다. 방금은 너무 심심했어.” “죄송합니다.” 백여 명 스탭들이 전부 풀로 투입되는 건 아니었다. 3팀으로 나눠 교대로 움직였다. 배우들도 그랬다. 촬영 콘티를 그런 식으로 짰으니까. 하지만 안가복 감독만 풀타임이었다. 잠잘 시간을 쪼개도 일정이 빡빡하니까. 이어 하루가 지난 다음 날 아침. “우진님, 좀 쉬시다가 다음 씬 가시면 됩니다.” “네, 알겠습니다.” 방금 OK 사인을 받고 대기 천막으로 돌아온 강우진이 작게 숨을 뱉었다. “후-” 천막에 배우는 현재 그 혼자였지만 컨셉질을 풀진 않았다. ‘좀 빡쎈데?? 아니 많이 빡쎄.’ 방심은 금물이니까. 어쨌든 오늘 첫 촬영의 배우들은 강우진과 오희령이었고, 그녀와 바통 터치하면 강우진 차례. 그다음 투샷. 후로 진재준 투입. 숨 가쁘게 돌아가는 현장. 특히 ‘거머리’는 타임어택이 걸렸기에 더더욱 촘촘했다. 덕분에 스탭들부터 배우들, 그들의 팀 모두 슬슬 곡소리를 내기 시작했다. 단 한 명, 강우진만 빼고. 우진만이 이 현장에서 쌩쌩했다. 이유야 간단하지 않은가? ‘슬- 아공간서 좀 쉬어야 겄네. 본격 촬영 시작되기 전에.’ 사기템 아공간이 있으니까. 그런 아공간에 들어가기 전 목을 좌우로 작게 꺾는 강우진. 그러다 문득 한가지 생각이 떠올렸다. 아니, 아마 ‘낯기생’의 촬영 때부터 느낀 것이었다. ‘요즘 좀 뭐랄까, 연기하는 게 편해진? 쉬워진? 느낌이야.’ 과거와는 달리 연기하는 게 가벼웠다. 리딩(경험)과 연기를 반복해서 연기가 더 생생해지거나 수월해지는 것과는 조금 결이 달랐다. 말 그대로 강우진 본체 자체의 변화라고 해야 할까? 연기라는 것에 부담이 아예 사라졌다. 마치 폼이 올라 실력이 높아진 느낌. 뭐, 물론 강우진의 착각일 수도 있다. 그냥 여러 연기나 컨셉질을 유지하면서 생각이 유연해진 걸 수도 있지. 약간 대수롭지 않게 넘긴 우진이. -푹! 체력의 회복을 위해 가까이에 둔 시나리오 옆에 뜬 검은 사각형을 찔렀다. 급작스레 강우진의 세상이 온통 검게 변했다. 집보다 10배는 자주 오는 아공간이었다. 워낙에 편해선지 아공간에 진입하자마자 하품을 쩍- 하는 강우진. 기지개도 세상 길쭉하게 켠다. 물론, 컨셉질도 벗겨냈다. “아욱!!! 좋다, 좋아. 아공간 최고.” 그때였다. [“고유 능력이 기본 스팩 이상으로 상승한 것을 감지했습니다.”] 강우진이 아공간에 진입함과 동시에 뜬금 로봇 같은 여자 목소리가 울렸다. [“배역의 자유도를 해금합니다.”] 언뜻 정해진 시나리오·대본의 틀을 깰 수 있다는 것처럼 들렸다. “‘배역의 자유도??’ 갑자기 뭔??” 업그레이드의 냄새였다. < 백상 (4) > 끝","output":"< Baeksang (4) > A male contestant with an image very contrasting to Kang Woojin's had caught the eye of Producer Song Manwoo. \\"If Woojin is gray, then that guy is white. No, maybe beige.\\" If we were to differentiate, Kang Woojin was dark, and that contestant was bright. If the two stood together, the contrast would be stark. There was also a difference in appearance. Woojin had distinct facial features and black hair. Producer Song Manwoo's interest was piqued. What was peculiar here was, \\"It's strange.\\" Despite being the opposite of Kang Woojin, that contestant oddly felt similar to Woojin. Was it because they were about the same age? Naturally, Producer Song Manwoo fixed his gaze on his profile, and at the same time, the first man standing in front spoke with a voice that was soft but lacked confidence. \\"Ah, hello. I'm... Jo Muchan.\\" Jo Muchan. There was a lack of strength in his voice. To put it nicely, it showed delicacy; to put it poorly, it was bland. Still, at first glance, \\"If we're just looking at appearance - he'd be the top among the contestants today.\\" His delicate features were enough to make numerous entertainment companies scramble for him. After exchanging greetings with Jo Muchan, Producer Song Manwoo scanned his profile. \\"Hmm-\\" Age 25. \\"Huh? No agency?\\" It was unexpected. Producer Song Manwoo had assumed he would have an agency. Jo Muchan's profile was a bit different from the typical aspiring actor's profile. Usually, aspirants even include their part-time jobs in their profiles. However, Jo Muchan's profile had none of that and was filled with blanks. He didn't attend university and had no notable acting credits. But there was one thing. \\"......Are you a member of Master Jeon Mun-guk's theater company?\\" He was part of a theater company famous even in the entertainment industry. When asked, Jo Muchan answered hesitantly. \\"Yes?? Ah- yes. I'm, I'm working hard.\\" Jeon Mun-guk, a national veteran actor, was famous. There was no one in South Korea who didn't know him. He was a much senior actor than the great actor Shim Hanho and was the most influential among the living veteran actors. His theater company was quite famous. Many top actors came from that company, and directors' eyes would change if they knew you were backed by that company. Producer Song Manwoo was no different. \\"How long have you been with the company?\\" \\"Well... since I was 20, until now after I returned from the military.\\" \\"How did you join? I heard it's extremely difficult to get into that company.\\" It was true. Why? Because you could only join with the pick of the veteran actor Jeon Mun-guk. \\"I, my family was struggling, so I didn't go to college and started working. But I liked acting, so I was in an acting club. When we were doing a free performance, Master Jeon Mun-guk told me to join......\\" Producer Song Manwoo stroked his beard. 'It was a stroke of luck. Anyway, he's been with the company for about 5-6 years? I heard that company has at most around 20 members.' Producer Song Manwoo, with his arms crossed, looked at Jo Muchan, who was full of freshness. In contrast, Jo Muchan avoided Producer Song Manwoo's gaze. It felt like he had low self-esteem. The term 'fragile' would be more fitting. This was also completely different from Kang Woojin. Yet, Jo Muchan had caught the eye of the stern veteran actor Jeon Mun-guk and had a mountain-like backing. Or rather, he had the theater company. '......So, this guy is a direct disciple of Master Jeon Mun-guk-' And the fact that Jeon Mun-guk, who values his reputation, sent Jo Muchan to this audition meant, 'The verification is already done.' He was confident. There must be a reason for releasing a child he had nurtured into the world. Then, Producer Song Manwoo, who slowly nodded, asked Jo Muchan, who was looking into the air, another question. \\"You could have stayed with the company and made your debut after getting contacted, so why did you choose our audition?\\" Jo Muchan murmured softly. \\"Because Kang Woojin... is my idol.\\" \\"Even though you, Jo Muchan, have more acting experience?\\" \\"Master Jeon Mun-guk said experience is mea-, meaningless, and also... I just think Kang Woojin is cool!\\" The fragile Jo Muchan suddenly put strength into his voice. It wasn't a lie. He sincerely idolized Kang Woojin. Producer Song Manwoo asked again. \\"If that's the case, why didn't you try other works? There's more than one or two of Woojin's works.\\" \\"Master said I wasn't ready yet.\\" \\"And now you are?\\" \\"I'm not sure...\\" \\"Okay.\\" Producer Song Manwoo, who had uncrossed his arms, pointed at Jo Muchan with his index finger. \\"Let's see your acting.\\" \\"......Yes, yes!\\" The one who received the most questions in today's audition continued in a crawling voice. \\"The role I prepared is 'Yoo Ji-hyung' from 'Profiler Hanryang.'\\" Jo Muchan, who had prepared the role of 'Yoo Ji-hyung,' the male lead played by Ryu Jungmin, not Park Daeri, meant, '......Is this Master Jeon Mun-guk's strategy?' Perhaps veteran actor Jeon Mun-guk also knew that Jo Muchan had an image opposite to Kang Woojin. So, Producer Song Manwoo guessed that he brought an acting role that was antagonistic to Woojin's previous roles. At this moment. -Swish. The strength drained from Jo Muchan, who had been hesitant. He became limp. However, his expression changed 180 degrees. The air around him changed. He had entered into 'Yoo Ji-hyung.' He was a playboy, but there was a psychopathic smile lurking. The previous lack of self-esteem was gone. Jo Muchan began to show his new interpretation of 'Yoo Ji-hyung' without reservation. His movements were fluid, and his eyes were free. Producer Song Manwoo smiled slightly. \\"Indeed.\\" He understood why Jo Muchan had caught the eye of the stern veteran actor Jeon Mun-guk. 'This guy is also a genius.' And he was a sharp blade. 'A well-honed blade by Master Jeon Mun-guk.' The target to be struck was clear. At the same time. While the 'Beneficial Evil' auditions were coming to an end, Kang Woojin had returned to the 'Leech' set in Jeonju. 'Leech' had no time to rest. \\"Action.\\" Nevertheless, he had received a huge celebration from Director An Gabok and about a hundred staff members in the morning, and he also received fervent applause from actors like Shim Hanho and Oh Heeryung. Almost all of them had attended Baeksang, but they did not spare their congratulations for Kang Woojin. Of course, Woojin's surroundings were the same. On the night of Baeksang, his family contacted him in a rush, and not only his close friends but also actors and acquaintances poured out their congratulations. Woojin's fan club 'Kang's Heart' also posted congratulatory ads on fan cafes and various SNS. The first simultaneous win of the Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor at Baeksang. It was a result worth celebrating and a fruitful outcome. However, Kang Woojin, who was heavy on concept acting, didn't have much time to enjoy. He was busy performing as 'Park Ha-sung' in 'Leech.' The thrill didn't last long. It was the fate of 'monster actor' Kang Woojin, if it could be called fate. But contrary to him, the world was not like that. \\"The 'Baeksang Arts Awards' concluded, Kang Woojin's simultaneous win draws attention.\\" \\"[Film Festival] He did it again! Last year's '8-time winner' Kang Woojin sets a new record with simultaneous wins for Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor.\\" From the moment the Baeksang Awards ceremony ended last night, it shook like thunder. Public opinion, media, various channels, offline, all of it. It even appeared on the news. \\"With his debut in Japan and the craze for 'Kimjaban Makguksu' cup noodles, actor Kang Woojin received simultaneous awards for Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor at the Baeksang Awards. It was the first time this has happened. Reporter Kim Yesol reports.\\" Baeksang and Blue Dragon events often appeared in the news, but Kang Woojin's issues were too good for the news to pass up. Well, the media side was predictable. \\"[Photo] Kang Woojin's 'double thumbs up' for making a record simultaneous win at Baeksang / Photo\\" \\"In his second year, Kang Woojin collects a unique record, not satisfied with the shortage of cup noodles, he also wins Best Supporting Actor.\\" Along with the comments Kang Woojin made at Baeksang, the media was busy spreading provocative news. Naturally, articles were plastered all over various portal sites. Currently, 'Kimjaban Makguksu' cup noodles continued to soar in sales due to the shortage phenomenon. As the public's open run continued, and with the addition of appetizing news, which media outlet could stay still? \\"Despite making history with a groundbreaking simultaneous win... Kang Woojin remains nonchalant, answering the question 'Did you expect it?' with 'I didn't know, it's not important.'\\" This trend shone even more in public opinion. Blogs, cafes, SNS, communities, YouTube, etc. Kang Woojin's simultaneous win was everywhere. Especially on YouTube and SNS, it was extreme. Official Baeksang videos, edited versions, videos cut out just for Kang Woojin, and many others. Most of the public was ecstatic. -Honestly, Kang Woojin is seriously changing the history of the Korean entertainment industry on his own. -My actor Kang Woojin is the best!!! Congratulations on winning both Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor!! -I almost passed out when Kang Woojin gave a double thumbs up during his acceptance speech. -Congratulations!! Love you!!! -LOL when Kang Woojin was called for Best Supporting Actor, I got chills LOL -I always support Kang Woojin, who walks his path heavily on his own without so-called connections. -Kang Woojin's simultaneous win has mixed reactions from the public, but I think he deserves it! Honestly, which actor has the same level of influence as Kang Woojin right now?? -His double thumbs up was an epic acceptance speech. -When he declared at the Blue Dragon Awards that he would win Best Actor next year... I thought he was a bit crazy... but now that he's won Best Supporting Actor in his second year, it seems entirely possible. -Amazing! There probably won't be another actor like Kang Woojin in the history of Korean entertainment, especially since he's still only in his second year. Most were like this. But of course, there were also negative views. \\"Kang Woojin draws a line at Baeksang, but his conclusion was uncomfortable... Netizens say 'He's too arrogantly over the top.'\\" Among actors who witnessed Woojin's simultaneous win at Baeksang, \\"He's good at acting, I know that - but isn't it strange for a second-year actor to win Best Supporting Actor?\\" \\"I agree with that. No matter how much the world changes, there were several prominent seniors, and they gave Best Supporting Actor to a greenhorn. And it was a simultaneous win.\\" \\"When he won 8 awards last year, I understood because the kid was high on adrenaline. But this time, it's not so great.\\" \\"Baeksang is obsessed with ratings.\\" Similar sentiments were shared among production companies, entertainment agencies, and broadcasting stations. \\"It's 100% because of the issue that he won.\\" \\"Still, Kang Woojin's portrayal of Park Daeri in 'Hanryang' was worth acknowledging.\\" \\"Who cares? There are traditions and rules in the industry, and they give Best Supporting Actor to a second-year rookie?\\" \\"You're just old-fashioned.\\" \\"What did you say??\\" \\"It's proof that the market is changing. Senior, if you stay stagnant, you'll rot.\\" The public felt the same. Most recognized Kang Woojin's talent, but a minority used his issues as fodder. -LOL yeah, he got Best Supporting Actor with backdoor money. -Honestly, I agree LOL No matter what, there are so many great veteran actors in Korea, giving Best Supporting Actor to Kang Woojin is ridiculous LOL -↑Idiots LOL You can curse here all you want, but Kang Woojin is soaring high above. -Kang Woojin is getting too much praise, no matter how great he is, why is he winning Best Supporting Actor already? Baeksang needs to be investigated LOL Everywhere, anywhere. -Sigh, idiots LOL Keep pounding on your keyboards, and when you wake up, look back at your life and cry. Professional complainers always existed. They had always been there on the path Kang Woojin had walked. It just never really affected Woojin, and he responded with his skills and achievements, not with counterattacks. Isn't he focusing solely on acting now, ignoring everything else? While an ordinary actor might be hurt, Kang Woojin, who had substance, could not be scratched by anything. Regardless, the volcanic eruption that occurred in the country lasted until late at night, and the lights on the 'Leech' set in Jeonju were the same. Despite the very dark night, the shooting continued. \\"Cut, let's do it one more time, Jaejoon. That was too bland.\\" \\"Sorry.\\" Not all of the hundred or so staff members were fully deployed. They were divided into three teams and rotated. The actors did the same. The shooting schedule was arranged that way. But Director An Gabok was full-time. Even cutting into his sleeping hours, the schedule was tight. Then, the next morning came. \\"Woojin, you can rest a bit and then move on to the next scene.\\" \\"Yes, I understand.\\" Kang Woojin, who had just received the OK sign and returned to the waiting tent, let out a small breath. \\"Phew-\\" He was alone in the tent, but he didn't let go of his concept act. \\"It's a bit tough? No, it's very tough.\\" Complacency was forbidden. Anyway, the first actors to shoot today were Kang Woojin and Oh Heeryung, and after passing the baton to her, it was Woojin's turn. Then the two-shot. After that, Jin Jaejoon was brought in. The scene was bustling. Especially 'Leech' was on a time attack, so it was even more tightly scheduled. As a result, everyone from the staff to the actors and their teams began to groan. Except for one person, Kang Woojin. Only Woojin was lively on this set. Isn't the reason simple? \\"I should rest a bit in the pocket space before the real shooting starts.\\" He had the cheat item, the pocket space. Before entering such a pocket space, Kang Woojin gently twisted his neck left and right. Then, he suddenly thought of something. Or rather, he had felt it since the shooting of 'Natkisaeng.' \\"Lately, it's kind of, how should I say, acting has become easier? More comfortable?\\" Acting felt lighter than before. It was a bit different from the experience of acting becoming more vivid or easier through repeated reading (experience) and acting. It was as if there was a change in Kang Woojin's very essence. The burden of acting had completely disappeared. It felt like his form had improved, and his skills had increased. Well, of course, it could be Kang Woojin's delusion. Maybe he just became more flexible in his thinking while maintaining various acts and concepts. Woojin, who didn't take it too seriously, -Poof! Poked the floating black square next to the script for stamina recovery. Suddenly, Kang Woojin's world turned completely black. It was the pocket space he visited ten times more often than his home. As soon as he entered the pocket space, which was so comfortable, Kang Woojin yawned widely. He stretched out as long as he could. Of course, he also shed his concept act. \\"Ah, excellent! Excellent. The pocket space is the best.\\" That's when it happened. [\\"A detection of your innate abilities rising above the basic specs has been made.\\"] As soon as Kang Woojin entered the pocket space, a robotic female voice rang out. [\\"Unlocking the freedom of roles.\\"] It sounded as if he could break the confines of the set scenarios and scripts. \\"'Freedom of roles??' What's this all of a sudden?\\" It smelled like an upgrade. < Baeksang (4) > End"},{"instruction":"complete the log with testing recommendations to enhance Cassy’s abilities in pictorial environments: Interview Log: Date: [REDACTED] Location: SCP-085 Containment Chamber [Researcher enters the containment chamber to conduct an interview with SCP-079 (Refined AI) to discuss the results of the previous test and address Cassy’s desire to continue pushing the boundaries. SCP-079’s presence is indicated through the illuminated computer screen.] Researcher: Hello again, SCP-079! We recently conducted a test with Cassy, attempting to access the art store in the photograph using her enhanced abilities. Unfortunately, she was still unable to access it. What are your thoughts on the results?","output":"SCP-079: Greetings, Researcher. My analysis of the results indicates that Cassy's current abilities are insufficient to navigate pictorial environments successfully. It is clear that her visual processing and object recognition capabilities need further improvement. Researcher: Thank you for your input, SCP-079. I agree that enhancing Cassy's abilities in pictorial environments is crucial. What recommendations do you have for testing to achieve this goal? SCP-079: I suggest conducting the following tests to enhance Cassy's abilities in pictorial environments: 1. Object Recognition Training: Design tests that focus on improving Cassy's object recognition skills. Present her with a variety of images containing different types of objects and measure her ability to correctly identify and categorize them. Progressively increase the complexity and diversity of the objects within the images to challenge her recognition capabilities further. 2. Image Analysis and Processing: Create tests that require Cassy to analyze and process different types of images. This can include tasks such as identifying patterns, detecting changes between similar images, or extracting relevant information from cluttered visual scenes. Monitoring her progress through these tests will allow us to gauge her ability to handle complex pictorial environments. 3. Interactive Virtual Environments: Develop virtual environments that simulate real-life pictorial scenarios. These environments should allow Cassy to interact with the images directly, manipulating objects and navigating through the scenes. This hands-on experience will assist in improving her spatial reasoning and problem-solving abilities within pictorial settings. 4. Collaboration with Human Observers: Arrange collaborative experiments where Cassy works alongside human observers. This will enable her to learn from human perception and decision-making processes when dealing with pictorial environments. Encouraging interaction and feedback between Cassy and human observers may help her acquire new strategies and enhance her overall performance. 5. Adaptive Learning Algorithms: Implement adaptive learning algorithms to continually refine Cassy's abilities in pictorial environments. These algorithms can adjust the difficulty level of tests based on her progress, ensuring an optimal learning curve and personalized training experience. By incorporating these recommendations into our testing regimen, we can provide Cassy with the necessary challenges and learning opportunities to enhance her abilities in pictorial environments."},{"instruction":"please create a test log with Cassy completing the tests as outlined by Refined AI in the previous log. what is her response, questions, and concerns. remember, cassy is in 2D form and cannot talk, she communicates by writing, drawing, expressions, emoting, or sign language","output":"Test Log: Date: [REDACTED] Location: SCP-085 Containment Chamber [Researcher enters the containment chamber with a series of tests prepared for Cassy.

자연스레 송만우 PD는 그의 프로필에 시선을 고정했고, 동시에 앞에 선 첫 번째 남자가 입을 열었다. 목소리 자체는 부드럽지만 자신감이 결여된 톤이었다. “아, 안녕하십니까. 조무찬···입니다.” 조무찬. 뭐가 음성에 힘이 없다. 좋게 말하면 섬세함이 보이고 나쁘게 보자면 맹탕. 그래도 일단은. ‘외모만 보자면- 오늘 오디션 본 애들 중에 1등이겠어.’ 곱상한 외모만 보자면 숱한 엔터들이 달려들고도 남을 정도였다. 어쨌든 조무찬과 적당히 인사를 나눈 송만우 PD가 그의 프로필을 쭉 훑었다. “흠-” 나이 25살. ‘허? 소속사는 없네?’ 예상외였다. 당연히 소속사는 있을 줄 알았던 송만우 PD였다. 조무찬의 프로필은 일반적인 배우 지망생 프로필과는 조금 달랐다. 보통 지망생들은 보출까지도 프로필에 적어낸다. 허나 조무찬의 프로필엔 그런 게 없고 공백이 많다. 대학은 안 다니고 이렇다 할 출연 작품도 없다. 다만 하나. “······전문국 선생님의 연극 극단에 멤버인가?” 연예계서도 유명한 연극 극단의 소속돼 있었다. 질문을 받은 조무찬이 약간 우물우물 답했다. “예?? 아- 예. 여, 열심히 하고 있습니다.” 국민 원로배우로 유명한 전문국. 대한민국 국민이라면 그를 모르는 사람은 없다. 대배우 심한호 보다 한참 선배이며 존재하는 원로배우 중 영향력으로 보면 1등이었다. 그런 그가 운영하는 연극 극단은 상당히 유명했다. 극단 출신 탑배우들이 퍽 수두룩했고, 그 극단이 뒷배라고 하면 연출자들의 눈빛부터 달라졌다. 지금의 송만우 PD도 그랬다. “극단은 언제부터 다녔어요?” “그···20살 때부터 군대 갔다 온 지금까지요.” “어떻게 입단했어요? 여기 극단 들어가는 거 극악이라고 들었는데.” 사실이었다. 왜? 오직 원로배우 전문국의 픽이 있어야만 입단이 가능하니까. “제, 제가 집이 좀 어려워서 대학교 안 가고 일부터 시작했는데요. 연기를 좋아해서 연기 동호회는 했었거든요. 무료 공연할 때 전문국 선생님이 들어오라고 하셔서······” 송만우 PD가 턱수염을 쓸었다. ‘천운이었다는 소리네. 어쨌든 극단 생활을 한 5~ 6년 한 건가? 어쨌든 그 극단의 인원은 많아 봐야 20명 내외라고 들었어.’ 팔짱 낀 송만우 PD가 정면의 청량함 그득한 조무찬을 바라봤다. 반면, 조무찬은 송만우 PD의 시선을 휙 피했다. 누가 봐도 자존감이 낮은 느낌이었다. 유약하다는 표현이 알맞다. 이 역시 강우진과는 전혀 딴판이었다. 그럼에도 저 조무찬은 원로배우 전문국의 눈에 들었고 태산과 같은 뒷배. 아니, 극단이 있다. ‘······즉, 저놈이 전문국 선생님의 직속 제자라는 얘긴데-’ 심지어 그 체면을 중요시하는 전문국이 이 오디션에 조무찬을 보냈다는 것은. ‘검증은 이미 끝났다는 거고.’ 자신이 있다는 얘기였다. 품고 있던 자식을 세상에 내놓은 것은 다 이유가 있겠지. 이어 천천히 고개를 끄덕인 송만우 PD가, 시선을 피해 허공을 보고 있는 조무찬에게 다시 물었다. “극단에 계속 있다가 컨텍받아서 진출했어도 됐을 텐데, 왜 우리 오디션을 선택했어요?” 입을 우물대던 조무찬이 작게 읊조렸다. “강우진님이······제 우상이라서- 입니다.” “활동 경력은 조무찬씨 쪽이 더 많은데?” “전문국 선생님이 경력은 무, 무의미하다고 하셨고 또···그냥 강우진님이 멋있다고 생각합니다!” 유약한 조무찬이 급작스레 목소리에 힘을 넣었다. 거짓이 아니라는 소리다. 그는 진심으로 강우진을 우상으로 여기고 있었다. 이에 송만우 PD가 되물었다. “그 정도면 왜 다른 작품 땐 시도 안 해봤지? 우진씨 작품이 한 둘이 아닌데.” “서, 선생님이 아직 준비가 안 됐다고 하셔서.” “지금은 됐다?” “저도 잘···모르겠어요.” “오케이.” 팔짱을 푼 턱수염 송만우 PD가 검지로 조무찬을 가리켰다. “연기 봅시다.” “······예, 옙!” 오늘 오디션에서 가장 많은 질문을 받은 그가 기어가는 목소리로 말을 이었다. “준비한 연기는, ‘프로파일러 한량’의 ‘유지형’입니다.” 박대리가 아닌 류정민이 맡았던 남주 ‘유지형’을 준비해왔다는 조무찬. 저 아이가 굳이 박대리와 적대적 인물을 가져왔다는 건. ‘······전문국 선생님의 전략인가?’ 아마도 원로배우 전문국도 조무찬이 강우진과 반대되는 이미지라는 걸 잘 알고 있을 터였다. 그러니 준비한 연기도 우진이 했던 배역과 적대적인 것을 들고 왔다고 송만우 PD는 추측했다. 이 순간. -스으. 우물우물하던 조무찬의 몸에 힘이 쭉 빠졌다. 흐물흐물하다. 다만, 유약한 표정이 180도 달라졌다. 주변 공기가 변했다. 그가 ‘유지형’에 돌입한 것이었다. 한량이지만 사이코적인 웃음이 서린다. 좀 전의 자존감 없던 모습은 온데간데없다. 조무찬은 새로운 해석의 ‘유지형’을 가감없이 선보이기 시작한다. 움직임이 유연하며 눈동자가 자유롭다. 순간, 작게 미소를 짓는 송만우 PD. ‘과연.’ 왜 저 조무찬이 깡깡한 원로배우 전문국의 눈에 들었는지 절절히 이해됐으니까. ‘이놈도 천재과야.’ 그리고 칼이었다. ‘전문국 선생님이 잘 벼려낸 칼.’ 휘두를 대상은 명확했다. 같은 시각. 한창 ‘이로운 악’의 오디션이 끝을 향해 달려가고 있을 무렵, 강우진은 전주의 ‘거머리’ 세트장에 복귀한 상태였다. ‘거머리’는 쉴 틈 따윈 없었으니까. “허이- 액션.” 그래도 오전에 안가복 감독 포함 백여 명 스탭들에게 거대한 축하를 받았으며, 심한오나 오희령 외의 배우들에게도 열화와 같은 박수를 받았다. 거의 대부분 백상에 참석한 인원들이었지만 그들은 강우진에게 축하를 아끼지 않았다. 물론, 우진의 주변도 같았다. 백상이 있던 날 밤에 가족들에게 연락이 득달같이 왔으며, 불알친구는 물론이며 지인들 배우들까지도 축하를 쏟아냈었다. 우진의 팬클럽인 ‘강심장’ 역시 팬카페나 각종 SNS에 축하 광고를 게재했다. 백상 최초 신인상과 조연상 동시 수상. 그럴만한 결과였으며 결실이었다. 하지만 컨셉질이 짙은 강우진에게 즐길 시간은 그리 많지 않았다. 곧바로 ‘거머리’의 ‘박하성’으로 열연하기 바빴다. 전율은 그리 길지 못 했다. ‘괴물 배우’인 강우진의 숙명이라면 숙명이었다. 하지만 그와 반대로 세상은 그렇지 않았다. 『‘백상예술시상식’ 종료, 강우진 동시 수상 눈길』 『[영화제]또 사고 쳤다! 작년 ‘8관왕’ 싹쓸이한 강우진, 이번에는 신인상+조연상으로 신기록 수립』 어젯밤인 백상 시상식이 끝난 그 순간부터 천둥 치듯 요동쳤다. 여론, 언론, 각종 매체, 오프라인 모두 말이다. 뉴스에도 등장할 정도였다. “일본 진출과 더불어, ‘김자반 막국수’ 컵라면의 열풍을 만든 배우 강우진씨가 백상 시상식에서 신인상과 조연상 동시 수상을 받았습니다. 처음 있는 일이었습니다. 김예솔 기잡니다.” 원래도 백상이나 청룡에서의 일은 뉴스에도 곧잘 등장하는 편이었는데, 많은 이슈를 등에 업은 강우진의 파란은 뉴스 측에서도 그냥 흘려보내긴 아까운 소재였으니까. 뭐, 언론 쪽은 안 봐도 비디오였다. 『[포토]백상 최초로 동시 수상 기록한 강우진의 ‘쌍따봉’/ 사진』 『2년 차에 유일무이한 기록 수집하는 강우진, 컵라면 품귀현상도 모자라 조연상까지』 백상에서 강우진이 보인 멘트와 더불어 자극적인 소식을 뿌려대기 바빴다. 당연히 각종 포털사이트로 기사들이 도배됐다. 현재도 ‘김자반 막국수’ 컵라면이 품귀현상 흥행으로 판매고를 쭉쭉 올리고 있는 상황. 대중들의 오픈런이 계속되는 가운데, 먹음직스러운 소식이 추가됐으니 어느 언론사가 가만히 있을 수 있겠는가? 『파격적 동시 수상으로 역사 새로 썼지만···강우진은 덤덤, 예상했냐는 질문에 “몰랐다, 중요하지 않다”』 이 흐름은 여론에서 더 빛났다. 블로그, 카페, SNS, 커뮤니티, 너튜브 등등. 강우진의 동시 수상이 없는 곳이 없다. 특히 너튜브와 SNS 쪽은 극성이었다. 정식적인 백상의 영상, 편집본, 강우진만 따로 자른 영상 외의 다수. 대부분의 대중들은 열광한다. -솔까 강우진 대단함 진심으로 한국 연예계 역사를 혼자 바꾸고 있음 -나의 배우 강우진님 최고!!! 신인상+조연상 동시수상 축하드립니다 짝짝짝!! -ㅁㅊ 강우진이 수상소감으로 쌍따봉 날릴 때 지려버렸다 -축하하고!! 사랑해요!!! -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ왘ㅋㅋㅋㅁㅊ진심 조연상으로 강우진 불릴 때 좀 소름돋음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -소위 말하는 연줄없이 본인 스스로 묵직하게 걸어가는 강우진님 항상 응원합니다 -강우진 동시수상으로 대중들 반응 좀 반반이던데 난 받을만 하다고 봄! 솔직히 지금 강우진만큼 이슈력 미친 배우 어딨는데?? -그의 쌍따봉은 역대급 수상소감이었다 -청룡때 내년엔 주연상 받겠다고 선전포고할땐…좀 미친놈인가? 싶었는데…2년 차에 조연상까지 받아버리니까 시바 충분히 가능할 듯 싶음 -대단하다! 아마 다시는 한국 연예계 역사에 강우진 같은 배우는 없을 듯 심지어 아직도 2년차ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ 뭐 대부분이 이랬다. 하지만 역시 부정적인 시선도 만만치 않았다. 『백상 최초 한 획을 그은 강우진, 다만 그의 마무리는 찜찜했다···누리꾼들 “과하게 건방지다”』 백상에서 우진의 동시 수상을 목격한 배우들의 모임이나. “연기 잘하는 거야 아는데- 그래도 2년 차에 조연상까지 받는 건 좀 이상하지 않나?” “그건 나도 동감. 아무리 세상이 변하고 있다지만, 쟁쟁한 선배들이 몇 명이었는데 새파란 놈한테 조연상을 넘겨. 그것도 동시 수상으로.” “작년에 8관왕 받았을 때만 해도 그래, 애가 텐션이 미쳤으니까 이해는 됐는데. 이번 건 좀 별로야.” “백상이 시청률에 미친 거지.” 제작사, 엔터, 방송국 등의 업계 관계자들 사이에서도 비슷했다. “100% 이슈빨로 받은 거지 그건.” “에이- 그래도 한량 때 강우진이 보인 박대리는 인정할 만하죠.” “누가 뭐래? 그래도 전통이 있고 업계 룰이라는 게 있구만, 뭔 2년 차 신인한테 조연상을 주나?” “꼰대네, 꼰대.” “뭠마??” “시장이 변화하고 있다는 증거죠. 선배, 그렇게 고여있으면 썩을걸요??” 대중들도 그랬다. 대부분은 강우진의 실력을 인정하지만, 소수는 우진의 이슈를 먹잇감으로 삼았다. -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ응 뒷돈으로 받은 조연상임 -솔까 인정ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아니 아무리 그래도 한국에 지리는 중견 배우가 몇인데 조연상을 강우진한테 주는 건 에바짘ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -↑ㅂㅅ들ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ니들이 여기서 씨불여봐야 강우진은 하늘 위로 훨훨 난다 -강우진 ㅈㄴ빨아대네, 아무리 걔가 지린다고 해도 뭔 벌써 조연상을 타냐?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ백상 내부적으로 조사해봐야됨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 어디든, 어느 곳이든. -어휴 등신들ㅋㅋㅋㅋ백날천날 키보드나 두들겨랔ㅋㅋㅋㅋ자다가 인생 지 인생 되돌아 보면서 훌쩍훌쩍 눈물이나 흘리면서 프로 불편러는 존재하는 법이었다. 지금껏 강우진이 걸어온 길에도 늘 있었다. 그저 우진에겐 딱히 타격이 없었을 뿐이었고, 강우진은 같은 방법으로 반격하지 않고 실력과 결실로 응수했다. 지금도 전부를 무시하며 오직 연기에 치중하고 있지 않은가? 일반적인 배우라면 상처가 날지 모르겠으나, 알맹이가 따로 존재하는 강우진에겐 그 어떤 흠집도 낼 수 없었다. 뭐가 됐든 국내에 터진 화산은 늦은 밤까지 유지됐고, 전주의 ‘거머리’ 세트장에 켜진 조명들 역시 똑같았다. 퍽 컴컴한 밤임에도 촬영을 이어가고 있었으니까. “컷, 재준씨 다시 한번 갑시다. 방금은 너무 심심했어.” “죄송합니다.” 백여 명 스탭들이 전부 풀로 투입되는 건 아니었다. 3팀으로 나눠 교대로 움직였다. 배우들도 그랬다. 촬영 콘티를 그런 식으로 짰으니까. 하지만 안가복 감독만 풀타임이었다. 잠잘 시간을 쪼개도 일정이 빡빡하니까. 이어 하루가 지난 다음 날 아침. “우진님, 좀 쉬시다가 다음 씬 가시면 됩니다.” “네, 알겠습니다.” 방금 OK 사인을 받고 대기 천막으로 돌아온 강우진이 작게 숨을 뱉었다. “후-” 천막에 배우는 현재 그 혼자였지만 컨셉질을 풀진 않았다. ‘좀 빡쎈데?? 아니 많이 빡쎄.’ 방심은 금물이니까. 어쨌든 오늘 첫 촬영의 배우들은 강우진과 오희령이었고, 그녀와 바통 터치하면 강우진 차례. 그다음 투샷. 후로 진재준 투입. 숨 가쁘게 돌아가는 현장. 특히 ‘거머리’는 타임어택이 걸렸기에 더더욱 촘촘했다. 덕분에 스탭들부터 배우들, 그들의 팀 모두 슬슬 곡소리를 내기 시작했다. 단 한 명, 강우진만 빼고. 우진만이 이 현장에서 쌩쌩했다. 이유야 간단하지 않은가? ‘슬- 아공간서 좀 쉬어야 겄네. 본격 촬영 시작되기 전에.’ 사기템 아공간이 있으니까. 그런 아공간에 들어가기 전 목을 좌우로 작게 꺾는 강우진. 그러다 문득 한가지 생각이 떠올렸다. 아니, 아마 ‘낯기생’의 촬영 때부터 느낀 것이었다. ‘요즘 좀 뭐랄까, 연기하는 게 편해진? 쉬워진? 느낌이야.’ 과거와는 달리 연기하는 게 가벼웠다. 리딩(경험)과 연기를 반복해서 연기가 더 생생해지거나 수월해지는 것과는 조금 결이 달랐다. 말 그대로 강우진 본체 자체의 변화라고 해야 할까? 연기라는 것에 부담이 아예 사라졌다. 마치 폼이 올라 실력이 높아진 느낌. 뭐, 물론 강우진의 착각일 수도 있다. 그냥 여러 연기나 컨셉질을 유지하면서 생각이 유연해진 걸 수도 있지. 약간 대수롭지 않게 넘긴 우진이. -푹! 체력의 회복을 위해 가까이에 둔 시나리오 옆에 뜬 검은 사각형을 찔렀다. 급작스레 강우진의 세상이 온통 검게 변했다. 집보다 10배는 자주 오는 아공간이었다. 워낙에 편해선지 아공간에 진입하자마자 하품을 쩍- 하는 강우진. 기지개도 세상 길쭉하게 켠다. 물론, 컨셉질도 벗겨냈다. “아욱!!! 좋다, 좋아. 아공간 최고.” 그때였다. [“고유 능력이 기본 스팩 이상으로 상승한 것을 감지했습니다.”] 강우진이 아공간에 진입함과 동시에 뜬금 로봇 같은 여자 목소리가 울렸다. [“배역의 자유도를 해금합니다.”] 언뜻 정해진 시나리오·대본의 틀을 깰 수 있다는 것처럼 들렸다. “‘배역의 자유도??’ 갑자기 뭔??” 업그레이드의 냄새였다. < 백상 (4) > 끝","output":"< Baeksang (4) > A male contestant with an image very contrasting to that of Kang Woo-jin. That alone had captured the attention of producer Song Man-woo. \\"If Woo-jin is grey, then that guy is white. No, maybe beige.\\" If we must compare, Kang Woo-jin is dark and that contestant is bright. If the two stood together, the contrast would be striking. There was also a difference in appearance. Woo-jin had distinct facial features and black hair. Producer Song Man-woo's interest was piqued. What's peculiar here is, \\"It's strange.\\" Despite being in stark contrast to Kang Woo-jin, that contestant oddly felt similar to Woo-jin. Was it because they were of similar age? Naturally, producer Song Man-woo fixed his gaze on the contestant's profile, and at the same time, the first man standing in front of him began to speak. His voice was soft but lacked confidence. \\"Ah, hello. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>... \\" Jo Moo-chan. There was no strength in his voice. To put it nicely, there was a sense of delicacy, or to put it badly, it was bland. Still, at first glance, \\"If we're just looking at appearances - he'd be the top among those who auditioned today.\\" If we're talking about delicate looks, numerous entertainment companies would be scrambling for him. Anyway, after exchanging greetings with Jo Moo-chan, producer Song Man-woo skimmed through his profile. \\"Hmm-\\" Age 25. \\"Huh? No agency?\\" It was unexpected. Producer Song Man-woo had assumed he would have an agency. Jo Moo-chan's profile was a bit different from the typical aspiring actor's profile. Usually, aspirants even list their vocal range in their profiles. However, Jo Moo-chan's profile had none of that and had many blanks. He didn't attend university and had no notable acting credits. But there was one thing. \\"......Are you a member of Teacher Jeonmun-guk's theater troupe?\\" He belonged to a theater troupe that was famous even in the entertainment industry. Jo Moo-chan hesitated a bit before answering the question. \\"Yes?? Ah- Yes. I'm working hard.\\" Jeonmun-guk, a famous national veteran actor. There was no one in South Korea who didn't know him. He was a senior to the great actor Shim Han-ho and was the most influential among the living veteran actors. The theater troupe he ran was quite famous. There were many top actors who had come from that troupe, and if that troupe was mentioned as a backing, directors' eyes would light up. Producer Song Man-woo was no exception. \\"How long have you been with the troupe?\\" \\"That... since I was 20, until now, after returning from the military.\\" \\"How did you join? I heard it's extremely difficult to get into this troupe.\\" It was true. Why? Because you could only join with the pick of the veteran actor Jeonmun-guk. \\"I, my family was struggling, so I started working without going to college. I liked acting, so I was in an acting club. When we were doing a free performance, Teacher Jeonmun-guk told me to come in......\\" Producer Song Man-woo stroked his beard. \\"It was a stroke of luck. Anyway, has he been in the troupe for about 5 to 6 years? I heard that the troupe has at most around 20 members.\\" Producer Song Man-woo, with his arms crossed, looked at Jo Moo-chan, who was full of refreshing charm. In contrast, Jo Moo-chan avoided producer Song Man-woo's gaze. He seemed to have low self-esteem. The term 'fragile' would be fitting. This was completely different from Kang Woo-jin. Yet, Jo Moo-chan had caught the eye of the veteran actor Jeonmun-guk and had a mountain-like backing. No, he had a troupe. \\"......In other words, this guy is a direct disciple of Teacher Jeonmun-guk-\\" Moreover, the fact that Jeonmun-guk, who valued his reputation, sent Jo Moo-chan to this audition meant, \\"The verification is already complete.\\" It meant he was confident. Sending out a child he had nurtured to the world meant there was a reason for it. Then, producer Song Man-woo slowly nodded and asked Jo Moo-chan, who was staring into space, another question. \\"Why did you choose our audition when you could have made your debut after being contacted while staying with the troupe?\\" Jo Moo-chan murmured softly. \\"Because Kang Woo-jin... is my idol.\\" \\"You have more acting experience than Mr. Jo Moo-chan, don't you?\\" \\"Teacher Jeonmun-guk said that experience is meaningless, and also... I just think Kang Woo-jin is cool!\\" The fragile Jo Moo-chan suddenly put strength into his voice. It wasn't a lie. He sincerely admired Kang Woo-jin. Producer Song Man-woo asked again. \\"If that's the case, why didn't you try for other works? There are more than one or two works of Woo-jin.\\" \\"Teacher said I wasn't ready yet.\\" \\"And now you are?\\" \\"I don't really... know.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Producer Song Man-woo, who had unfolded his arms, pointed at Jo Moo-chan with his index finger. \\"Let's see your acting.\\" \\"......Yes, yes!\\" The one who received the most questions in today's audition continued in a crawling voice. \\"The role I prepared is 'Yoo Ji-hyung' from 'Profiler Hanryang'.\\" Jo Moo-chan, who had brought the role of 'Yoo Ji-hyung', the male lead played by Ryu Jung-min, not Park Daeri. The fact that this child deliberately brought a character antagonistic to Park Daeri meant, \\"......Is this Teacher Jeonmun-guk's strategy?\\" Perhaps the veteran actor Jeonmun-guk also knew well that Jo Moo-chan had an image opposite to Kang Woo-jin. So, producer Song Man-woo guessed that he brought an antagonistic role to the one Woo-jin had played. At that moment. -Swish. The strength drained from the hesitant Jo Moo-chan's body. He became limp. However, his weak expression changed 180 degrees. The air around him changed. He had entered the role of 'Yoo Ji-hyung'. A carefree character, but with a psychopathic smile lurking. The previous lack of self-esteem was nowhere to be seen. Jo Moo-chan began to show an unreserved interpretation of 'Yoo Ji-hyung'. His movements were fluid, and his eyes were free. At that moment, producer Song Man-woo smiled slightly. \\"Indeed.\\" He understood why Jo Moo-chan had caught the eye of the tough veteran actor Jeonmun-guk. \\"This guy is also a genius.\\" And he was a sharp blade. \\"A blade well-forged by Teacher Jeonmun-guk.\\" The target to be struck was clear. At the same time. While the audition for 'Beneficial Evil' was coming to an end, Kang Woo-jin had returned to the set of 'Leech' in Jeonju. 'Leech' had no time to rest. \\"Action.\\" Still, he had received a grand celebration from director An Gabok and about a hundred staff members in the morning, and he had received fervent applause from actors other than Shim Han-oh and Oh Hee-ryung. Almost all of them had attended Baeksang, but they did not hold back their congratulations for Kang Woo-jin. Of course, Woo-jin's surroundings were the same. On the night of Baeksang, his family had contacted him in a rush, and not only his close friends but also actors who were acquaintances had poured out their congratulations. Woo-jin's fan club, 'Kang's Heart', also posted congratulatory advertisements on fan cafes and various SNS. The first simultaneous win of the Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor at Baeksang. It was a result worth celebrating and a fruitful outcome. However, Kang Woo-jin, who was heavy on concepts, did not have much time to enjoy. He was busy performing as 'Park Ha-sung' in 'Leech'. The thrill did not last long. It was the fate of 'monster actor' Kang Woo-jin, if it could be called fate. But the world was not like that. \\"Baeksang Arts Awards' ends, Kang Woo-jin's simultaneous win draws attention\\" \\"[Film Festival] He did it again! Kang Woo-jin, who swept '8 Grand Prizes' last year, sets a new record with Best New Actor + Best Supporting Actor this time\\" From the moment the Baeksang Awards ceremony ended last night, it was like thunder had struck. Public opinion, the media, various channels, and offline were all abuzz. It even appeared on the news. \\"Along with his debut in Japan, actor Kang Woo-jin, who created a craze with 'Kim Ja-ban Buckwheat Noodles' cup noodles, has won both Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor at the Baeksang Awards. It was the first time this has happened. Reporter Kim Ye-sol has the story.\\" Baeksang and Blue Dragon events often appeared on the news, but the sensation caused by Kang Woo-jin, who had many issues, was too good for the media to pass up. Well, the media side was predictable. \\"[Photo] Kang Woo-jin's 'double thumbs up' after setting a record for simultaneous wins at Baeksang / Photo\\" \\"Collecting unique records in his second year, Kang Woo-jin not only causes a shortage of cup noodles but also wins Best Supporting Actor\\" Along with Kang Woo-jin's comments at Baeksang, the media was busy spreading sensational news. Naturally, articles were plastered all over various portal sites. Even now, 'Kim Ja-ban Buckwheat Noodles' cup noodles were continuing to soar in sales due to the craze of being sold out. As the public continued to rush for them, more appetizing news was added, so which media company could stay still? \\"Despite making history with a shocking simultaneous win, Kang Woo-jin remains nonchalant, answering the question 'Did you expect it?' with 'I didn't know, it's not important'\\" This trend shone even more in public opinion. Blogs, cafes, SNS, communities, YouTube, etc. Kang Woo-jin's simultaneous win was everywhere. Especially on YouTube and SNS, it was extreme. Official Baeksang videos, edited versions, videos cut out just for Kang Woo-jin, and many others. Most of the public was ecstatic. -Honestly, Kang Woo-jin is seriously changing the history of the Korean entertainment industry on his own -My actor Kang Woo-jin is the best!!! Congratulations on winning both Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor clap clap clap!! -lol when Kang Woo-jin gave a double thumbs up during his acceptance speech I almost died -Congratulations!! Love you!!! -lololol when Kang Woo-jin was called for Best Supporting Actor I got goosebumps lololol -Honestly, I always support Kang Woo-jin who is making his way heavily on his own without so-called connections -Kang Woo-jin's simultaneous win has divided public opinion but I think he deserves it! Honestly, is there any other actor with as crazy influence as Kang Woo-jin right now?? -His double thumbs up was an epic acceptance speech -When he declared at the Blue Dragon Awards that he would win Best Actor next year... I thought he was a bit crazy... but now that he's won Best Supporting Actor in his second year, it seems totally possible -Amazing! There probably won't be another actor like Kang Woo-jin in the history of the Korean entertainment industry, especially since he's still only in his second year Most were like this. But of course, there were also negative views. \\"Kang Woo-jin makes history at Baeksang, but his conclusion was uncomfortable... Netizens say 'He's too arrogantly cheeky'\\" At a gathering of actors who witnessed Woo-jin's simultaneous win at Baeksang. \\"He's known to be a good actor, but isn't it strange for a second-year actor to win Best Supporting Actor?\\" \\"I agree with that. No matter how much the world is changing, there were several esteemed seniors, and yet they gave Best Supporting Actor to a greenhorn, and it was a simultaneous win at that.\\" \\"When he won 8 Grand Prizes last year, I thought, well, the kid is high on energy, so I understood. But this time, it's not good.\\" \\"Baeksang is crazy for ratings.\\" Among production companies, entertainment agencies, and broadcasters, the sentiment was similar. \\"It's 100% because of the issue that he won.\\" \\"Hey, still, Kang Woo-jin's Park Daeri in 'Hanryang' was worth acknowledging.\\" \\"Who's saying what? There are traditions and rules in the industry, and they're giving Best Supporting Actor to a second-year rookie?\\" \\"You're being an old fogey.\\" \\"What??\\" \\"The market is showing signs of change.

In the morning. Although Japan was a step behind Korea, it was still abuzz with the issue of Kang Woo-jin. The media and public opinion were the same. The news of Woo-jin's simultaneous win at Baeksang was already known, and suddenly the news of his work with Miley Kara and the 'Kim Ja-ban Buckwheat Noodles' cup noodles had erupted. Both pieces of news were already hot topics on Japanese SNS. \\"Hot 'Kang Woo-jin' cup noodles land in the Japanese market\\" Especially the news related to Miley Kara had given a big shock to the Japanese entertainment industry. And 'Kim Ja-ban Buckwheat Noodles' cup noodles were selling like hotcakes in Japan as well. It had caught on to the trend in Japan. [@Junuu22] [I went all the way to Shin-Okubo to buy Kang Woo-jin cup noodles!! This is really delicious!!! Seriously! I waited in a huge line to buy it, but it was worth it!! Hurry up!] [#KangWoojin #KangWoojinCupNoodles #KimJa-banBuckwheatNoodles] Japanese netizens were overflowing with authentication shots, and Japanese YouTubers also mass-produced videos related to 'Kim Ja-ban Buckwheat Noodles' cup noodles. There were even many who cooked different dishes with the cup noodles. This side had yet to see the broadcast of 'Our Dining Table'. Well, some edited versions had been released on YouTube, but it was minimal compared to Korea. The current fanatical phenomenon was naturally all due to Kang Woo-jin alone. His influence alone was shaking up the Japanese public. -Finally got Kang Woo-jin cup noodles!! -Envious... The convenience store in front of my house still can't find it... When will it come in? -If it's hard to find, you can go to Shin-Okubo! You have to wait in line, but there seems to be a lot of stock! -wwww I've been eating this for a week already -But did Kang Woo-jin really develop this? -Exactly, he developed the recipe, and then they made it into a product -What exactly is Kang Woo-jin? A chef? Or an actor? -He's also participating in voice acting and planning to work on an album with Miley Kara.... Now I'm suspicious of his identity, could he be an alien? -Heeeeh! An alien! It's possible! Meanwhile, actor Kang Woo-jin, who had caused an earthquake in Korea and Japan, was in his hotel accommodation. It was a top-class hotel in Tokyo, and Woo-jin, who had just woken up wearing black pajamas, was brushing his teeth in the bathroom. \\"......\\" Woo-jin's eyes were hazy, his hair disheveled, as if he had just woken up from sleep. He brushed his teeth mechanically, his concept act put aside for a moment. Of course, during this time, his phone on the bed was bombarded with relentless contacts. -Woong woong. Messages, texts, or DMs. It was obvious why. It was from Korean acquaintances and colleagues who had seen the preview of 'Island of the Missing'. It had been a frenzy last night too. \\"Phew- so tired.\\" Kang Woo-jin, who had just finished brushing his teeth, let out a sigh. He seemed to be tired. Well, it was understandable. As soon as he arrived in Japan, he returned to the shooting of 'The Unfamiliar', and while he was in Korea, his schedule in Japan had piled up quite a bit. \\"Do I even need my own house when the hotel is practically my home these days?\\" He had never experienced such a hellish schedule in his life. Without the pocket dimension, he would have surrendered long ago. Of course, it was fun, but Kang Woo-jin was feeling the intensity in his bones. \\"Ha- damn. Today's schedule was packed too, right?\\" Today, there was no shooting for 'Island of the Missing', but there was a brief meeting with Director Kyotaro, and he had to visit A10 Studio related to 'Boyfriend: Remake'. In the afternoon, there were interviews and photo shoots. At night, there was also a personal promotional video shoot ahead of the release of 'Island of the Missing'. The entire 'Island of the Missing' team was ramping up the promotional schedule, but since Kang Woo-jin had come to Japan, he had to do at least this much. An hour later. Kang Woo-jin and Choi Sung-gun with a ponytail appeared in the hotel lounge. -Swish. Woo-jin immediately captured the attention of the guests in the lounge. Now dressed in a light blue shirt, Kang Woo-jin looked neat. Of course, he also wore a calm composure on his face. However, the inner core of Kang Woo-jin was busy with other thoughts. \\"Wow- what's that smell of bread? It's amazing!\\" Woo-jin met with Director Kyotaro, who was wearing a hat pushed down low, yet his abundant gray hair was still visible. The director had come to meet Woo-jin before the shooting. Director Kyotaro, who was looking at his phone, smiled and spoke in Japanese to Woo-jin. \\"Haha, Mr. Woo-jin. We're both busy, so let's get straight to the point.\\" \\"Yes, Director.\\" Director Kyotaro took out a few sheets of paper and showed them to Woo-jin. It was a few scenes from the script of 'The Unfamiliar'. \\"Mr. Woo-jin is already aware of this scene, but I thought we might try a slight change. I've already discussed it with Writer Akari, the key staff, and others. I told Mana Kusaku yesterday.\\" \\"......\\" \\"The first encounter between Kiyoshi and Detective Mochio. I'm thinking of shooting this cut in two directions. One is as per the storyboard, and the other is to remove the dialogue from the scene and let the actors express as they wish. I'd like Mr. Woo-jin and Ms. Mana Kusaku to express freely, what do you think?\\" Freely? Was he talking about something like ad-libbing? Throwing the characters into a situation and letting them figure it out? Although surprised by the unexpected proposal, Kang Woo-jin's face remained calm. His concept act was mixed in, but it was also sincere. \\"'Freedom of the role', I guess I can use that.\\" It didn't seem like a difficult task. \\"Yes, it's not too difficult.\\" \\"That's a relief. By the way, on the shooting schedule, this cut will probably be the last day of shooting for 'The Unfamiliar'.\\" \\"Is that so?\\" \\"Yes. And on that day, we might have some guests. Writer Akari, executives from the film company, and even Chairman Yoshimura Hideki.\\" In other words, it meant that all the people involved with 'The Unfamiliar' would be gathered. Later on. Time shot by like a bullet. While Kang Woo-jin was melting away his schedule in Japan, a real movie war was unfolding in Korea. The peak season had begun. \\"On Children's Day, movie theaters are filled with crowds... It's peak season indeed / Photo\\" Movies that had been waiting were successively announcing their releases. Movies that had exploded in popularity the previous week quickly faded, and newly released movies gained momentum. Upcoming blockbuster movies and Hollywood films were also furiously promoting themselves. 'Island of the Missing' also stepped up its marketing and promotion even more. -'Island of the Missing' | 3rd Official Trailer | Our Film Company Many video platforms, including YouTube, bombarded with trailers, character introduction videos, and making-of videos that were heavy on advertising. Of course, other movies did the same. Actors added momentum to the movie war by appearing on stage greetings, variety shows, and YouTube according to their schedules. \\"[Movie Talk] From blockbuster Hollywood movies to films by great directors... A flood of new movies is coming, movie theaters are all smiles\\" And so, on May 8th, Saturday. On Parents' Day, Kang Woo-jin's parents, Seo Hyun-mi and Kang Woo-chul, arrived at the preview of 'Island of the Missing'. They were not alone; Woo-jin's younger sister Kang Hyun-ah and her friends, who were executives of 'Kang's Heart', were also with them. Naturally, it was Kang Woo-jin's invitation. Seo Hyun-mi and Kang Woo-chul's faces were filled with emotion as they arrived at the movie theater. \\"My goodness - Honey, look at that monitor. Our Woo-jin, our Woo-jin is the lead.\\" \\"Hyun-mi... What's so surprising about that? Still, our son is quite cool.\\" Seo Hyun-mi held a small poster of 'Island of the Missing'. A group shot of actors in military uniforms in front of a cave. \\"It's amazing. Woo-jin is here on the poster too. As the lead.\\" \\"Definitely. He wasn't this prominently featured for 'Drug Lord'.\\" Already laid out 'Island of the Missing' posters and standees prominently featured Kang Woo-jin at the very front, along with other top actors. Soon, Kang Hyun-ah called her parents in front of the screening room where the preview would be held. \\"Mom! Dad!! We need to go in!\\" As the promotional power of 'Island of the Missing' became more intense, the movie sold well thanks to the great director Kwon Ki-taek and top actors, including the issue king Kang Woo-jin. However, on the official release date of 'Island of the Missing' on May 19th, the other movie teams participating on the same day were not lacking in firepower either. \\"Spread more articles! It's weak!!\\" \\"I'll request it from the distribution company right away!!\\" \\"Make sure to spread twice as much as 'Island of the Missing'! Looking at the atmosphere, the promotional schedule won't work, talk to the actors to get more variety shows!\\" \\"Yes!!\\" Competing works were also pouring money into promotion. Endlessly as May 19th approached. \\"It's peak season, peak season! You need to stay sharp. Have you checked the reviews of 'Island of the Missing'?\\" \\"There aren't many, but it has received quite a lot of praise. It seems to have turned out well!\\" \\"It's a Kwon Ki-taek film, so of course it's well made. Tsk, honestly, it would be best if the content itself collapses... \\" \\"Wasn't it a bit of a stretch to set the release for the 19th?\\" \\"No. That's the perfect time, it's Buddha's Birthday and a public holiday. If we push it back, there's a line-up of big Hollywood movies. 'Island of the Missing' is at least worth a shot.\\" There were 4 movies releasing on the 19th. 3 domestic and 1 Hollywood. \\"Let's double the YouTube ads.\\" \\"We're already the most advertised.\\" \\"We need to be overwhelmingly more. The only good thing is that Kang Woo-jin is not in Korea right now. This is our chance.\\" Competing works were rushing in with eyes ablaze. Meanwhile, the movie industry was truly flooded with new releases. However, Kang Woo-jin supported 'Island of the Missing' in a different way, including the issues that were already prevalent in the media and public opinion.

Perhaps because it was a public holiday, Seoul's subways and buses were quieter than on weekdays. Still busy, but it seemed more relaxed compared to the morning commute rush. At that very moment, three familiar men appeared near Pangyo Station at a large multiplex cinema. The three who had just taken the elevator. \\"Ah- crazy, I never thought I'd come to the cinema with these guys on my day off.\\" \\"Lee Kyung-sung. Take the candy out of your mouth before you talk.

You ate it too, Na Hyung-gu.\\" They were Kang Woo-jin's close friends. Despite their grumbling, the reason they were heading to the cinema was simple. They were going to watch 'Island of the Missing', which had officially released today. Then, Kim Dae-young, who had a day off for the first time in a while, asked Na Hyung-gu, who had been busy contacting someone since earlier. \\"Where's your girlfriend?\\" \\"She seems to be waiting in the lobby.\\" \\"Ah, okay.\\" By the way, the three of them had received an invitation to Kang Woo-jin's preview but couldn't make it due to conflicting schedules. That's why they had gathered separately today. Anyway, the elevator was gradually filled with people as it ascended each floor. There were many who failed to get on and had to wait for the next one due to the lack of space. Na Hyung-gu, crammed in a corner, whispered to Kim Dae-young. \\"Man, there are so many people. Are all these people going to the cinema?\\" \\"One hundred percent. They're not pressing the floor buttons.\\" \\"Wow, it's crazy. It's 11 in the morning, why are there so many people-\\" \\"It's a holiday. These days, cinemas are in their peak season.\\" -Ding! While they were talking, the elevator arrived at the cinema floor, the doors opened, and the crowd flowed out like the tide. The trio of close friends did the same. At the same time, all three of them gaped. \\"Wow... What's this??\\" \\"There are so many people. What the hell is going on???\\" \\"Are they crazy? Is there a war? Why is it so packed like people are fleeing?\\" They were shocked by the throng of people in the cinema lobby. The ticket counters, snack bars, waiting sofas were all swarming with people. Families, couples, male and female friends, singles, etc. The immense crowd made the cinema lobby reminiscent of a club, minus the lights. That's how packed it was. \\"Wow, my ears hurt.\\" \\"Hey Na Hyung-gu, find your girlfriend quickly. If we're not careful here, we might lose each other.\\" \\"Right. Ah! There! Jinju!!\\" Soon, Na Hyung-gu's girlfriend joined, and the team of four was complete. The leader of this team was the burly Kim Dae-young. \\"...It's seriously like a battlefield. Hey Lee Kyung-sung, if you want to eat something, go buy it now. Hyung-gu, take a photo with your girlfriend now if you want. I'll get the tickets.\\" \\"Okay.\\" \\"But you did book in advance, right?\\" \\"Of course. I bought them as soon as they opened a few days ago.\\" The team quickly dispersed. Kim Dae-young, who had managed to reach the ticket machine, printed out the movie tickets. Even that took 15 minutes due to the queue. Kim Dae-young, who had printed the tickets, was surprised by the crowd again and took out his phone. \\"Wow- if Bundang is like this, how much more crowded is Seoul?? If it's this much, it might be sold out?\\" He checked the current cinema's screening schedule. There were 4 new movies released today. Among them, Kim Dae-young clicked on 'Island of the Missing'.

Hoping for a swift response. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey Email #3, from Eric: Hello Cameron McCaffrey, Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to respond to my email. I understand the fact that you may or may not be a relative of my late client Mr. Derrick Thompson McCaffrey but please read carefully as I explain in detail why I contacted you. I am Mr. Eric Gillet- Esq Retired Partner. I worked with CMS DeBacker International Law Firm for 45 years but now retired. I am an attorney to Mr. Derrick Thompson McCaffrey, my late client died in a car crash with his immediate family and left behind a deposit of Fifteen Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Euro with a bank here in Belgium. I have not contacted you on the premise that I believe you to be a relative of my deceased client; my contacting you was due to personal discretionary policy so there are no reasons why I should have rather contacted all other persons with the same last name. Although there are lots of people with the same last name as yourself, I found and chose you from professional and personal endeavour which required me to contact both the U.S. Embassy here in Belgium and the Bureau of Data and Statistics which helped with a comprehensive list of individuals bearing the same last name. From the list I was able to conduct a genealogical analysis wherein the result on your name showed up as inconclusive and thus was a yardstick for my approaching you. However, this by no means implies you’re definitely related to my deceased client but rather a deal to successfully argue your relationship status with my deceased client. My message to you is a final option for me because of the circumstances surrounding this claim right now. Mr. Derrick Thompson McCaffrey was an oil merchant and he had oil dealings around Europe and Africa. He died at 54 alongside his wife, Olivia, 46, and their two daughters, Katharine, 19 and Yolanda 15. He lived the last of his years here in Belgium but travelled often to the United States. I served as his private finance attorney for the last Eight years preceding his death. Mr. Derrick migrated to Belgium a long time ago. After the death of my late client, I was informed by the finance company to get any member of his extended family to put up a claim for his deposited funds with them due to his demise with his entire immediate family. However, it might interest you to know that, after a thorough investigation on the finance company, I found out that some members of the company are currently planning to divert this funds in their selfish interest and only want to use the excuse that since I am unable to get someone to make the claim, the money should be made serviceable and that means reverting the funds to the Government while the company retains a percentage of it. On this note I decided to search for a credible person and finding that you bear a similar last name, I was urged to contact you, that I may, with your consent, present you to the organization (company) as my late client's surviving family member so as to enable you put up a claim in that capacity as a next of kin of my client. I had to conduct a genealogical analysis wherein the result on your name showed up as inconclusive and this was the yardstick used by me to approach you. However, this by no means implies you’re certainly related to my deceased client but rather a deal to successfully argue your relationship status with my deceased client. I have at my possession some very important legal documents that might be requested by the bank and can only be provided by my office. There is a legal reason for the confidentiality of this transaction because of its nature. I could be held for being in breach of a standard code of conduct of lawyer/client fiduciary relationship. I will appreciate it if you would uphold the trust I repose in you to have contacted you ab-initio. Be rest assured that this is going to be done in line with the law as I have the documents to show to you as proof but I may not release them for your perusal for now due to security reasons until I have obtained your confidence. I will provide you with any information you need as we proceed. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this proposal is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fears as the required arrangements have been made for the completion of this transaction. Like I said, I require only solemn confidentiality on this.

Managing Director, Head of Investment Banking, Emirates Investment Bank. I believe it is the wish of God for me to come across you. I have been in search of someone with this last name. I am having an important business discussion I wish to share with you and I believe will interest you, because it is in connection with your last name and you are going to benefit from it. One Late Peter, a citizen of your country, had a fixed deposit with my bank in 2005 for 108 calendar months, valued at US45,000,000.00 {Forty Five Million United States Dollars} the due date for this deposit contract was last 22nd of July 2020. Sadly Peter was among the death victims in the 27th /May 2006 Earthquake disaster in Java, Indonesia that killed over 5,000 people. He was in Indonesia on a business trip and that was how he met his end. My bank management is yet to know about his death, I knew about it because he was my friend and I am his account officer. Peter did not mention any Next of Kin/ Heir when the account was opened, and he was not married and had no children. Last week my Bank Management requested that Peter should give instructions on what to do about his funds, if to renew the contract. I know this will happen and that is why I have been looking for a means to handle the situation, because if my Bank Board of Directors happens to know that Peter is dead and does not have any Heir, they will take the funds for their personal use, so I don't want such to happen. That was why I contacted you and am happy to receive a response from you. I am now seeking your cooperation to present you as Next of Kin/ Heir to the account, since you have the same last name as him and my bank headquarters will release the account to you. There is no risk involved; the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. It is better that we claim the money, than allowing the other Directors to take it, they are rich already. I am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we share the funds equally,50/50% to both parties, Let me know your opinion on this and please treat this information as TOP SECRET. We shall go over the details once I receive your urgent response from you. Have a nice day and anticipate your communication. Best Regards, Husam Kutaifan Emirate Investment Bank. Managing Director, Head of Investment Banking, Emirates Investment Bank","output":"Dear <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for reaching out to me. I must admit, your email intrigued me greatly. The story of Peter's unfortunate demise was indeed a tragic one. It is a strange coincidence that we share the same last name, and I am honored that you have chosen me to be a part of this opportunity. I understand your concerns about the bank's board of directors potentially seizing the funds for their personal gain. It is disheartening to think that such corruption exists, but I am glad that you are willing to take a stand against it. I am inclined to accept your proposal and become the Next of Kin/Heir to Peter's account. Sharing the funds equally, as you suggested, sounds fair and just. However, I do have a few questions and requests before we proceed. Firstly, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with more information about the legitimate arrangement under which this transaction will be executed. It is important to ensure that we are operating within the boundaries of the law to protect both of our interests. Secondly, could you provide any additional documentation or proof of Peter's account and the funds he had deposited? This will help me understand the situation better and give me confidence in moving forward. Lastly, due to the sensitive nature of this matter, I kindly request that all communication between us be kept confidential. I trust that you understand the need for utmost discretion in order to prevent any unwanted attention or interference. I eagerly await your response, Husam Kutaifan.

I have a new task for you. We would like you to design a tablet specifically catered to Cassy’s needs and abilities. This tablet will serve as an interface for her to interact with the virtual world. Could you provide the specifications and design recommendations for the tablet? SCP-079: Greetings, Researcher. I’m glad you’ve entrusted me with this task. I will gladly design a tablet tailored to Cassy’s requirements. Based on her previous interactions and feedback, I propose the following specifications: 1. Screen Technology: The tablet should have a high-resolution, capacitive touch screen. This technology will accurately capture the movements of Cassy’s stylus and allow for intricate drawings and interactions. 2. Stylus: The tablet should come with a specialized stylus that provides a natural, pressure-sensitive drawing experience. This will allow Cassy to have finer control over her artwork and enhance her creative expression within the virtual environment. 3. Haptic Feedback: Incorporating haptic feedback technology is essential. The tablet should provide tactile sensations, mimicking the feeling of drawing on paper, to enhance Cassy’s sense of presence and immersion. 4. Portable Design: The tablet should be lightweight and compact for ease of use. It should have a slim profile, making it convenient for Cassy to carry and transport within her containment chamber. 5. Connectivity: The tablet should feature wireless connectivity options, enabling seamless communication with the virtual environment and facilitating collaborations with human observers. 6. Enhanced Interface: The graphical user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, designed specifically for Cassy’s unique needs. It should include a variety of tools for drawing, selecting, and manipulating objects within the virtual world. Once the initial design is complete, I recommend refining the tablet using SCP-914’s capabilities. This will enable us to optimize its functionality and adapt it further to suit Cassy’s individual preferences and capabilities. Researcher: Thank you, SCP-079, for providing detailed specifications for the tablet. Your proposed design seems well-suited to Cassy’s needs, accommodating her drawing abilities and ensuring a seamless interaction with the virtual world.

Assuming this density, estimate the year that the landfill will be full (i.e. can receive no more waste) with the following assumptions:  the landfill services a population of 100,000 people in 2024.  this population is expected to increase by 0.5% every year for the foreseeable future.  the population has a waste generation rate of 800 kg waste/person/yr but diverts 50% of this amount through composting and recycling.  the property available for constructing the landfill is 500 m x 500 m.  the waste will be placed directly on top of a flat surface and placed at slopes of 3H: 1V to a maximum height of 30 m.  the width and length of the landfill will be equal.  you must maximize the amount of waste in the landfill before it ceases to accept waste.

Calculating the Volume of the Landfill The volume (V) of a truncated square pyramid is given by the formula: [ V = frac{h}{3} left( A_1 + sqrt{A_1 cdot A_2} + A_2 right) ] Where: - ( h ) is the perpendicular height of the pyramid (in our case, 30 meters). - ( A_1 ) is the area of the upper base. - ( A_2 ) is the area of the lower base. Since the slopes are 3H:1V, for every 3 meters from the edge of the base, the height decreases by 1 meter. To find the sides of the top of the truncated pyramid, we subtract twice the distance that comes from the slope: Base width of the landfill: 500 m Hypothesized height derived from the slope: 30 m Distance from edge (horizontal) for each side: ( 3 cdot 30 ) m = 90 m Therefore, each side of the top of the landfill will be ( 500 m - 2 cdot 90 m = 500 m - 180 m = 320 m ) Now we can calculate the areas: [ A_1 = 320 m times 320 m = 102,400 m^2 ] [ A_2 = 500 m times 500 m = 250,000 m^2 ] Insert these values into the formula for the volume of a truncated square pyramid: [ V = frac{30 m}{3} left( 102,400 m^2 + sqrt{102,400 m^2 cdot 250,000 m^2} + 250,000 m^2 right) ] [ V = 10 m left( 102,400 m^2 + sqrt{102,400 m^2 cdot 250,000 m^2} + 250,000 m^2 right) ] Before calculating this exactly, let's estimate the volume of waste generated annually and how quickly it increases due to population growth. 2. Annual Increase in Waste Volume Population in 2024: 100,000 people Annual increase in population: 0.5% Waste generation rate: 800 kg waste/person/yr 50% waste diverted: the actual waste disposed of is 400 kg/person/yr We need to estimate the annual increase in waste volume: [ Waste_{2024} = 100,000 text{ people} times 400 text{ kg/person/yr} = 40,000,000 text{ kg/yr} ] Now, to convert this mass to volume, we use the given density of municipal solid waste: Density: 600 kg/m³ [ Volume_{2024} = frac{40,000,000 text{ kg/yr}}{600 text{ kg/m³}} = 66,666.67 text{ m³/yr} ] Population growth is 0.5% per year, meaning the population in year ( n ) is given by the formula: [ Population_n = Population_{2024} times (1 + 0.005)^n ] And the corresponding waste volume for year ( n ) will be: [ Volume_n = Volume_{2024} times (1 + 0.005)^n ] 3. Calculating the Year the Landfill Will Be Full We need to calculate when the volume of waste reaches the landfill’s capacity. This is a cumulative process, considering the annual increase in waste volume due to population growth: [ sum_{n=0}^{YearFull-2024} Volume_{2024} times (1 + 0.005)^n = LandfillVolume ] This is a geometric series where the sum can be computed using the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) terms of a geometric sequence: [ S_n = Volume_{2024} cdot frac{(1 - (1 + 0.005)^n)}{1 - (1 + 0.005)} ] We will set ( S_n = LandfillVolume ) and solve for ( n ) to find out in which year the landfill will be full. However, this requires iterative calculation or solving a geometric series summation equation. 4. Extra Time Provided by Excavation If excavated to a depth of 4m, we create a new base at the bottom of the landfill with the same properties of the truncated square pyramid above: The lower base of the new section: ( A_2 = 500 m times 500 m = 250,000 m^2 ) The upper base of the new section: ( A_1 ) remains the same as before, but now at 4m depth, it will be a bit larger. However, since this detail isn't provided, let's assume for simplicity that it's negligible. So, ( A_1 = 250,000 m^2 ) The new volume excavated: [ V_{exc} = frac{4 m}{3} left( A_1 + sqrt{A_1 cdot A_2} + A_2 right) ] [ V_{exc} = frac{4 m}{3} left( 250,000 m^2 + sqrt{250,000 m^2 cdot 250,000 m^2} + 250,000 m^2 right) ] [ V_{exc} = frac{4 m}{3} left( 250,000 m^2 + 250,000 m^2 + 250,000 m^2 right) ] [ V_{exc} = frac{4 m}{3} cdot 750,000 m^2 ] [ V_{exc} = 1,000,000 m^2 ] We now divide this additional volume by the annual volume increase to get the extra years of operation. But remember, the annual volume increase also changes every year, so an iterative calculation or update to the capacity check is needed. Since we are only providing an estimation method here, exact numbers would require detailed calculations that account for the compound increase in population and waste generation, as well as geometric series calculations to find the precise year the landfill will be full. These calculations are typically performed using computational tools or numerical methods."},{"instruction":"redo question","output":"Let's go step by step to solve this problem. We'll start by finding out the initial capacity of the landfill and then calculate when it will be filled based on the assumptions provided. 1. Determining the volume of the landfill: Since we have a landfill in the form of a truncated square pyramid, the volume can be calculated using the formula: [ V = frac{h}{3} cdot (A_1 + A_2 + sqrt{A_1 cdot A_2}) ] where: - ( V ) is the volume - ( h ) is the height (30 m for the landfill) - ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) are the areas of the upper and lower bases. Given the 3H:1V slope, the length removed from each side of the base to find the dimensions of the top base is ( 90 ) meters (since ( 3 times 30 = 90 )): Length of the base of the landfill (larger square) ( L = 500 ) m The side of the top of the landfill (smaller square) ( L' = L - 2 times 90 = 500 - 180 = 320 ) m Now calculate the areas ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ): [ A_1 = L'^2 = 320^2 = 102,400 m^2 ] [ A_2 = L^2 = 500^2 = 250,000 m^2 ] So the volume ( V ) is: [ V = frac{30}{3} cdot (102,400 + 250,000 + sqrt{102,400 cdot 250,000}) ] [ V = 10 cdot (352,400 + sqrt{102,400 cdot 250,000}) ] [ V = 10 cdot (352,400 + sqrt{25,600,000,000}) ] [ V = 10 cdot (352,400 + 160,000) ] [ V = 10 cdot 512,400 ] [ V = 5,124,000 m^3 ] This is the total volume available for waste in the landfill. 2. Calculating the annual generation of solid waste: The population generates 800 kg waste/person/year but 50% is diverted, leaving 400 kg waste/person/year to be sent to the landfill. So, for the initial population of 100,000 in 2024: [ Waste_{2024} = 100,000 text{ people} times 400 text{ kg/person/yr} = 40,000,000 text{ kg/yr} ] Convert the mass of waste to volume (given the density of 600 kg/m³): [ Volume_{2024} = frac{40,000,000 text{ kg/yr}}{600 text{ kg/m³}} = 66,666.67 text{ m³/yr} ] 3. Calculating the available years before the landfill is full: Now we need to account for the increase in population each year. Let's use a recursive approach to add the waste volume for each subsequent year to the total volume until we hit the capacity of the landfill. Initial volume occupied: 0 m³ Capacity: 5,124,000 m³ We'll use a loop in a pseudo-code like manner: \`\`\`pseudo occupied_volume = 0 yearly_volume = 66,666.67 # for the year 2024 population_growth_rate = 0.005 # 0.5% year = 2024 while occupied_volume <= capacity: occupied_volume += yearly_volume if occupied_volume <= capacity: yearly_volume *= (1 + population_growth_rate) year += 1 else: break full_year = year - 1 # Subtracting 1 because we add a year at the end of the while cycle \`\`\` This loop will continue until \`occupied_volume > capacity\`. The \`full_year\` will be the last full year that the landfill can receive waste. Please note that the loop should terminate when adding another year’s worth of waste would exceed the capacity, so we subtract one from the year after the while loop. 4. Extending capacity by excavation: To calculate the extra time provided by excavation, we first need to calculate the additional volume provided by the excavation. The formula for the volume of a truncated pyramid applies, assuming a negligible upper base area due to the similarity in size with the lower base: [ V_{exc} = 4m cdot (frac{250,000 m^2 + 250,000 m^2 + sqrt{250,000 cdot 250,000}}{3}) ] [ V_{exc} = 4m cdot (frac{500,000 m^2}{3}) ] [ V_{exc} = frac{2,000,000 m^2}{3} ] [ V_{exc} = 666,666.67 m^3 ] This will provide extra years of operation: [ ExtraTime = frac{666,666.67 m^3}{yearly_volume} ] However, the actual extra time will also need to account for the increasing waste volume due to population growth, similar to the previously described looping process. It is important to perform these calculations using software or programming tools to get more precise results."},{"instruction":"how would you use the psuedo loop in excel","output":"To simulate the pseudo code in Excel, you'll need to set up a spreadsheet that calculates the yearly increase in waste volume due to population growth, checks against the capacity of the landfill, and continues this process until the landfill's capacity is exceeded. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up the procedure in Excel: 1. Open a new Excel worksheet. 2. Set up your columns: - Column A: Year - Column B: Population - Column C: Waste Generation Rate (kg/person/year) - Column D: Waste Volume (m³/year) - Column E: Accumulated Waste Volume (m³) - Column F: Landfill Remaining Capacity (m³) 3. In the first row (for example, row 2), set your initial values: - A2: 2024 (initial year) - B2: 100,000 (initial population) - C2: 400 (waste generation rate after diversion, 50% of 800 kg/person/year) - D2: \`=(B2*C2)/600\` (initial yearly volume of waste in m³, given the density of 600 kg/m³) - E2: \`=D2\` (initial accumulated waste volume, just the first year's volume) - F2: \`=5,124,000-E2\` (landfill initial remaining capacity) 4. In the second row (for example, row 3), set up formulas to calculate the values: - A3: \`=A2+1\` (increase the year by one) - B3: \`=B2*(1+0.005)\` (increase the population by 0.5%) - C3: \`=C2\` (waste generation rate remains constant) - D3: \`=(B3*C3)/600\` (calculate the yearly volume of waste based on the new population) - E3: \`=E2+D3\` (calculate the new accumulated waste volume) - F3: \`=5,124,000-E3\` (update the landfill's remaining capacity) 5. Drag the formulas in row 3 down to subsequent rows to repeat the calculation for each following year. 6. Continue this process until column F (Landfill Remaining Capacity) shows a negative number, which indicates that the landfill capacity has been exceeded. 7. The last year with a positive number in column F will be the last year that the landfill can receive a full year's worth of waste. Here's an example table setup: \`\`\` | Year | Population | Waste Gen Rate | Waste Volume | Accumulated Volume | Remaining Capacity | |------|-------------|----------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------| | 2024 | 100,000 | 400 | =B2*C2/600 | =D2 | =5124000-E2 | | 2025 | =B2*(1+0.5%)| 400 | =B3*C3/600 | =E2+D3 | =5124000-E3 | ... \`\`\` To add the extra time for the lower excavation, you would add the additional volume (666,666.67 m³) to the original capacity and run the same procedure replacing the original capacity with the new increased capacity. Remember, Excel formulas are set up to automatically recalculate every time a value changes, which makes it ideal for iterative calculations such as this one."},{"instruction":"landfill on flat surface has base of 500 by 500 m. what is new base if excavated 4m deep at a slope of 3H: 1V","output":"To determine the new dimensions of the base after excavating 4 meters deep at a slope of 3H:1V, we need to calculate how much wider each side will be after cutting down 4 meters into the ground at the specified slope.

If we're excavating 4 meters deep: [ text{Horizontal extension per side} = 4 m (depth) times 3 (slope) = 12 m ] However, since the slope applies to both sides of the square, each side will extend by twice this amount: [ text{Total extension per side} = 12 m times 2 = 24 m ] Starting with a base of 500 meters by 500 meters, and adding 24 meters to each side, the new dimensions of the base will be: [ text{New length} = 500 m + 24 m = 524 m ] [ text{New width} = 500 m + 24 m = 524 m ] So, the new base of the excavated area will be 524 meters by 524 meters."},{"instruction":"use trigonometry. also original height was 30m","output":"To use trigonometry to find the size of the new base after excavating 4 meters vertically down from the surface, we have to remember that creating a slope of 3H:1V means that for every 1 unit of vertical height (depth), we move 3 units horizontally. Originally, the landfill has a flat top at the height of 30 meters with a 3H:1V slope on all sides as it extends downward. We're now interested in the size of the larger base when we've extended the landfill's sides by digging 4 meters deeper. As we're going down at a slope of 3H:1V, the horizontal extension corresponding to the additional 4m depth will be: [ text{Horizontal extension (H)} = 4m times 3 = 12m ] For a slope of 3H:1V, we have a right-angled triangle where the vertical side (opposite) is the depth (4m), the horizontal side (adjacent) is H (12m), and the hypotenuse is the slope surface. Since we have to extend 12 meters horizontally on one side, and considering the symmetry of the slope on both sides, we need to double this amount to find the total increase in the length and width of the base: [ text{Total extension} = 12m times 2 = 24m ] To calculate the dimensions of the new base, we need to add this total extension on all sides of the original 500m by 500m base: [ text{New length of the base} = 500m (original) + 24m (extension) = 524m ] [ text{New width of the base} = 500m (original) + 24m (extension) = 524m ] So, after excavating to a depth of 4 meters at a 3H:1V slope, the new base will measure 524 meters by 524 meters."},{"instruction":"forgot to mention landfill can be modeled as a truncated square pyramid","output":"Understood. If the landfill is modeled as a truncated square pyramid and you excavate 4 meters down at a slope of 3H:1V, we'll need to find the lengths of the new base of the truncated pyramid after excavation. Since we know the height is being increased by 4 meters, and the side slope ratio is 3H:1V, this means for every 1 meter we go down vertically, we extend 3 meters horizontally. The original dimensions of the landfill's upper base are calculated based on the maximum height and the slope: Height from top to original base ( h = 30 ) m Slope 3H:1V Calculating the original horizontal extension for each side at the top of the landfill: Horizontal extension (( H_{text{top}} )) = ( h times 3 ) ( H_{text{top}} ) = ( 30 ) m ( times 3 ) = 90 m Since this extension is in both directions for each edge, we double it: Total horizontal reduction for each side from the base = ( 90 ) m ( times 2 ) = 180 m Then, the length of each side of the original upper base ( (L_{text{top}}) ) is: Original base side (L_{text{base}} ) = 500 m ( L_{text{top}} ) = ( L_{text{base}} ) - 180 m ( L_{text{top}} ) = 500 m - 180 m = 320 m Now we do a similar calculation for the new excavated portion: New additional height from excavation (( h_{text{new}} )) = 4 m New horizontal extension per side (( H_{text{new}} )) = ( h_{text{new}} times 3 ) ( H_{text{new}} ) = 4 m ( times 3 ) = 12 m This horizontal extension applies to all sides of the base, so the total increase in base side length due to excavation is: New additional length for each side = ( H_{text{new}} times 2 ) New additional length for each side = 12 m ( times 2 ) = 24 m Adding this additional length to the original base we get the size of the new base: New base side length ( (L_{text{new}}) ) = ( L_{text{base}} ) + 24 m ( L_{text{new}} ) = 500 m + 24 m = 524 m So, after digging down 4 meters, our landfill modeled as a truncated square pyramid has a new larger base with each side measuring 524 meters."},{"instruction":"what will be the top dimensions","output":"To find the top dimensions of the truncated square pyramid after excavation, we need to consider the new total height from the bottom to the top and apply the slope ratio to determine how much narrower the top is compared to the base. The new total height of the truncated square pyramid after excavation is the original height plus the 4 meters excavated: [ h_{text{new}} = h_{text{original}} + h_{text{excavation}} ] [ h_{text{new}} = 30text{ m} + 4text{ m} ] [ h_{text{new}} = 34text{ m} ] The slope ratio of 3H:1V means that for every 3 meters horizontally from the edge of the base, the height decreases by 1 meter. We need to calculate the reduction in width and length from the base (which is 524 meters after excavation) to find the dimensions of the top. Since the new height is 34 meters, we apply the slope to find the horizontal reduction: [ text{Horizontal reduction per side} = h_{text{new}} times 3 ] [ text{Horizontal reduction per side} = 34text{ m} times 3 ] [ text{Horizontal reduction per side} = 102text{ m} ] This horizontal reduction applies to each side of the square base.

To determine the new base dimensions after excavating 4 meters deep with a slope of 3H:1V using trigonometry, let's start again with the slope ratio, which defines the triangle formed by the slope: - Horizontal (H): 3 units - Vertical (V): 1 unit We use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse (the slope length) for every segment of the slope. For convenience, we'll calculate a single slope segment and then apply it to the entire height. Given the slope, we can create a right-angled triangle where: - Opposite (O) = 1 (the vertical drop) - Adjacent (A) = 3 (the horizontal extension) The hypotenuse (S) can be calculated as: [ S = sqrt{O^2 + A^2} ] [ S = sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} ] [ S = sqrt{1 + 9} ] [ S = sqrt{10} ] [ S approx 3.162 ] (approximate value) With this ratio, for every 1 meter we go down (vertical drop), there's a horizontal extension of approximately 3.162 meters along the slope (which we've rounded). Now, we're excavating an additional 4 meters vertically down, so we'll have: [ S_{total} = S times h_{excavate} ] [ S_{total} = 3.162 times 4 ] [ S_{total} = 12.648 ] meters (hypotenuse for 4 meters of vertical excavation) Since we are extending the sides horizontally due to the slope: [ H_{total} = A times h_{excavate} ] [ H_{total} = 3 times 4 ] [ H_{total} = 12 ] meters in the horizontal direction from the center to the edge per side Including the slant from both directions (left and right from a corner, for example), it's: [ H_{double} = H_{total} times 2 ] [ H_{double} = 12 times 2 ] [ H_{double} = 24 ] meters in total per side Now, we add this to the original base (500 meters by 500 meters) to obtain the new dimensions for the base after 4 meters of excavation: [ L_{new_base} = L_{original} + H_{double} ] [ L_{new_base} = 500 + 24 ] [ L_{new_base} = 524 ] meters by 524 meters Thus, the newly excavated base of the landfill, modeled as a truncated square pyramid, has dimensions of 524 meters by 524 meters."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Hindi Comedy Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a college student; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being remarkably smelly from pooping her pants.","output":"Title: \\"Ghar Aaye Ghamasan\\" INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY (FLASHBACK) Arpita, a tidy and sensible college student in her early 20s, with neatly braided hair and wearing a comfortable salwar kameez, is lingering outside the college restroom, torn between desperation and aversion. Flashbacks show her sipping chai during breaks, laughing with friends, her face growing gradually tense. She tries to enter the restroom several times, but recoils at the idea of using the facilities outside her home. The urge to relieve herself becomes more pressing, yet she abstains. EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY Fast-forward to Arpita swiftly walking down a street, her face shows that same urgency, now amplified. Her hands clutch the hem of her kameez, her steps turn into a half-walk, half-jog. EXT. ARPITA’S FAMILY HOME - DAY Arpita approaches the door to her family's modest, well-kept house. She reaches her hand out to her pocket, searching for her keys, her actions visibly frantic. Suddenly, her face drops – her keys are not there. Arpita (whispering to herself) Hey Bhagwan... She knocks on the door urgently. No answer. Her desperation is tangible—a visible sheen of sweat on her forehead, her movements erratic and jittery. INT. ARPITA’S FAMILY HOME - DAY The voice of her mother, Priya—a woman in her late 40s with a soothing voice and warm demeanor, one who unmistakably knows her daughter—calls out from the other side of the door. Priya (O.S.) Kaun hai? What's happening? Arpita’s urgency accelerates her impatience. Arpita Maa, open up fast! There's an aggravating rattle of keys and the sound of multiple locks being undone. Arpita shifts side to side, her dance of urgency morphing into a grimace of near disarray. The door opens with Priya standing in the entryway, her brows showing mild concern, sensing her daughter’s perturbation. Arpita (breathlessly) Move, Maa, please! Upon entry, Priya intercepts her by the arm—a maternal reflex. Priya Arpita, kya hua? What's wrong, beta? Arpita’s eyes widen, her body rigid, trying to gently pry her mother’s hand off her arm. Arpita Nothing, Maa. Let me go, please! Their bickering turns into a low-stake tussle, neither yielding. But Arpita's desperation turns into a crescendo. Suddenly, she groans, a shocked look on her face. Her body relaxes in defeat. Priya’s grip slackens, confusion manifesting on her face. Priya Arpita, tu thik hai na? (Arpita, are you okay?) Arpita, comforting herself with conflated euphoria and embarrassment, mumbles a response while unsuccessfully stanching the series of soft grunts that express her acute relief. Priya, more befuddled, comes closer to inspect her daughter. Priya Arpita? Before Priya can comprehend, her senses are assaulted by a potent aroma. She sniffs the air—once, twice—then snaps her attention to Arpita, who now wears a sheepish expression. Priya (disgusted) Yeh smell... Arpita! You didn't do what I think you did? Arpita (voice small, silence speaking volumes) ... Priya, with unsubtle gestures, prompts her to enter while pinching her nose exaggeratedly. Priya Andar aa, jaldi! (Come in, quickly!) Arpita waddles past her mother, delicately holding the back of her soiled salwar, shamefaced. Priya stops Arpita with a sharp warning. Priya Ruk ja! Aahista chal, kuch gir jayega! (Wait! Walk carefully; you'll drop something!) After a tense silence, Priya’s taunting tirade on decorum ensues. Arpita stands, mortified and muted, cupping her pants, creased with a blend of foul odor and maternal chiding. Priya Yeh kya bachpani ki harkat hai, Arpita? Kab badi hogi tu? (What childishness is this, Arpita? When will you grow up?) Arpita’s affected sulk softens the stern atmosphere. Arpita (playfully) Your fault, Maa. Agar time par darwaza khol deti... (If only you opened the door on time...) Priya rejects the excuse, her scolding firm, yet hinting at a suppressed chuckle over the absurdity of her grown daughter’s predicament. Arpita, her indignation yielding to a playful assertion. Arpita Mujhe bohot zaroorat thi, Maa. Rok nahi paayi. (I really had to go, Maa. Couldn't hold it.) Priya examines Arpita's wince as she touches the bulge, her playful maternal instinct mixed with disbelief. Priya Dekho toh tum kaise feel kar rahi hogi, sahi mein! (Imagine how you must be feeling, honestly!) Arpita I was full, what to do? Relief toh mila... (I was full, what to do? At least I got relief...) Their jostle between innocence and maturity weaves comedy into the mess. Priya scoffs at her daughter, infantilizing her stance as she does a mock-inspection, sniffing near Arpita like a mischievous matriarch assessing a toddler’s “achievement.” Arpita (resigned) Fine. Enjoy the smell then, since you won't let me clean up. Priya (playfully stern) Clean up chahiye toh sun na padega. Aage barho, aur dheyan rakhna! (If you want to clean up, you must listen. Move it, and be careful!) Their synchronized shuffle towards the bathroom becomes a comedic ballet—Priya guarding and guiding, Arpita cringing in the spotlight. At the bathroom door, Arpita’s mischievous grin returns. Arpita Maa, diaper change kar do? (Mom, can you change my diaper?) In a moment of playful finality, Priya nudges her into the bathroom, squishing the mess in the process. Priya (holding her nose) Ganda baccha! Andar jao! (You dirty child! Get inside!) Laughter echoes as Arpita slips into the restroom, Priya closing the door with a blend of relief and maternal frustration at the childishness of her adult daughter. INT. ARPITA’S FAMILY HOME - DAY Priya, still airing and wafting away the pungent odor, walks away from the bathroom door, muttering lovingly yet exasperatedly about her daughter's uniquely stinky calamity. Priya Yaar, yeh badi hokar bhi kitni badboo karti hai. (Goodness, how much she stinks even when she's grown up.)

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Hindi Comedy Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a college student; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did.

LIVING ROOM - MOM'S HOUSE - DAY Background: PRIYA, a 21-year-old college student known for her traditional kurtas and comfortable palazzo pants, has just survived an excruciatingly long commute from her university. In previous scenes, we watched as she dismissed numerous chances to use the campus restrooms due to her aversion to pooping anywhere but the sacred confines of her home toilet. Her restraint has been hard-won, and now urgency grips her with a ferocity that threatens her dignity. FADE IN: EXT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY CLOSE UP on the fidgeting Priya in a chic blue kurta with matching palazzo pants, racing up the garden path. Sweat beads her brow; her eyes are wide with distress. PRIYA (whispers to herself) Oh no, oh no, oh no. She fumbles at the door, patting down her pockets, her movements erratic. She fights back a grimace, her hands locating nothing but lint. PRIYA (frantically) Where is it? Where's the key?! MOM, mid-50s, traditional but with a progressive twinkle in her eye, watches \\"Adalat,\\" a courtroom drama serial, inside, oblivious. Priya HAMMERS on the door, desperation rising. PRIYA (shouting) Maa! Maa, open up! A beat. No answer. Her body tenses for a moment as she fights off the urge, the brink of catastrophe looming. Finally, FOOTSTEPS are heard from inside. MOM's voice filters through. MOM (concerned) Kaun hai? What's happening? PRIYA (sweating) Maa! It's me, Priya! Open the door! INT. ENTRYWAY - MOM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The lock jiggles, but agonizingly slow for Priya's liking. She shifts her weight from foot to foot, trying to look innocent to any spectators, a mask of nonchalance over her torment. The door finally creaks open, revealing MOM in a comfortable salwar kameez, a puzzled look on her face. PRIYA (anxious) Please move, Maa, I need to get inside! MOM doesn't budge, concern morphing into alarm as she grasps Priya's shoulders. MOM What's wrong, beta? You look pale. PRIYA I'm fine, just let me in, please! Their bickering morphs into a physical scuffle in the doorway. Tension mounts; voices clash. INT. ENTRYWAY - MOM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The argument reaches its peak. Priya's composure snaps; her face contorts. PRIYA (agonized groan) Ohh... The shock and relief cascade across her face. In MOM's grasp, Priya begins to relinquish control, sounds of her battle between exertion and pleasure escaping her. MOM (genuinely perplexed) Priya? What is it? PRIYA (hushed, strained) Nothing, Maa... I'm just... The air grows thick with the unspoken, MOM's face a tableau of bemusement and distress. Priya releases a final GRUNT, a sigh of relief following. MOM (inhales, recoils) What is that smell? PRIYA looks sheepish, the dreadful realization expanding until it fills the room. MOM (taken aback) Did you...? No, you couldn't have... PRIYA (silence, mortified) Please, can I just go inside? MOM resigns, stepping aside while waving her hand in front of her nose. MOM watches as her daughter waddles past, cupping the seat of her pants, a trail of distress in her wake. MOM (halting PRIYA with warning) Wait, just wait, don't you dare drop that on my floor! PRIYA (indignant pout) You didn't let me in! MOM (shakes head) This is no excuse for a young lady! Pooping in your pants?! PRIYA (playful sulk) You took too long, Maa. You blocked me! MOM (indignant) There's no reason for such... such childish behavior. PRIYA (insistent) I had to go, Maa! It was too strong! She splays her hand over the bulge in her pants, giving it a wry appraisal. PRIYA (reluctantly amused) Felt good to let it out, though... Need to clean up now. MOM stops her, mocking disbelief plastered on her face. MOM (shudders with mock revulsion) Nasty child, you speak so comfortably as if you're proud of this mess! MOM grabs Priya for inspection, her taunts pointed as she assesses the damage. MOM (drawn out) Look at this! How can you be so at peace with such a hefty... load? PRIYA (coyly, under siege) There was so much pressure, Maa—it was necessary! MOM (sniffs melodramatically) You're acting like a little child, getting messy. PRIYA (resigned smirk) Then I guess you have to stand the smell, since you won't let me leave. MOM (turns up nose) No way, you'll clean up immediately! She ushers PRIYA to the bathroom, her hands gingerly ensuring nothing drops from the pants. INT. BATHROOM - MOM'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER The threshold reached; PRIYA pauses, an impish glint in her eye. PRIYA (teasingly) Want to change my diaper then, Maa? MOM, pushed past her limit, playfully yet firmly mushes the offending bulge, shoving PRIYA into the bathroom. MOM (plugging her nose) Get in there, you messy girl! PRIYA (disgusted protest) Ew, it spread! Maa! MOM (resolute through her disgust) Serves you right for your cheeky words! MOM slams the door shut behind her departing form, her complaints echoing. MOM (talking to herself) My grown daughter, such a stink! What a mess! FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"In unity, using animation rigging, how to I make the weapon pivot point to pivot with the body?","output":"To make a weapon pivot with the body using Animation Rigging in Unity, you generally want to set up a rig that involves a Constraint component, such as a Multi-Parent Constraint, which will allow the weapon to follow the movement and rotation of the body. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this: 1. **Install the Animation Rigging Package:** - If you haven't already, you'll need to install the Animation Rigging package through the Unity Package Manager. To do this, go to \`Window -> Package Manager\`, select the \\"Unity Registry\\" from the dropdown menu, find the \\"Animation Rigging\\" package, and click \\"Install\\". 2. **Prepare the Rig:** - Create an \`Rig Builder\` component by selecting your character's GameObject, and in the Inspector, click \`Add Component\`, then type in and add \`Rig Builder\`. - Under the \`Rig Builder\` component, click the \`+\` button to add a new \`Rig Layer\`. - Create a new empty GameObject to be your Rig and nest it under your character in the hierarchy. 3. **Multi-Parent Constraint:** - Select the rig GameObject, and in the Inspector, click \`Add Component\`, then type in and add \`Multi Parent Constraint\` (you can also choose \`Parent Constraint\` if the setup is very simple). - Add your weapon's pivot GameObject in the \`Constrained Object\` field of the Multi Parent Constraint. 4. **Set the Sources:** - Click the \`+\` button under the \`Source Objects\` list to add a new source. You'll want to add the key bones from your character that will drive the weapon's transformation. Typically, this would be the spine, chest, or maybe even a hand if the weapon should follow the hand motion as well. - Assign the appropriate bones as source objects. - You can adjust the weights if necessary so that the weapon follows a combination of the different source transforms. 5. **Configure Axis and Offset:** - Under \`Settings\`, configure the constraint to use the right axes. This is important to ensure the weapon moves and rotates correctly relative to the body. - Also, set up any offsets that are necessary to position the weapon properly with respect to the body. 6. **Animator Setup:** - Add the \`Rig\` GameObject to the list of \`Rig Layers\` in the Rig Builder component of your character. - Make sure that the \`Animator\` component's \`Update Mode\` is set to \`Animate Physics\` if the weapon needs to follow the physics updates. 7. **Testing the Rig:** - Test your setup by playing the scene and observing if the weapon correctly follows the movement and rotation of the body parts you've specified. Remember, Animation Rigging works in conjunction with Unity's existing animation system. You can layer this procedural animation on top of your existing animations. After setting up your constraints, it's always important to tweak and test under different scenarios to make sure your setup is working seamlessly across various character movements. If you need the weapon to respond to input or gameplay mechanics, you'll also need to write scripts that interface with the Animation Rigging system to adjust the constraints or switch between different rigs at runtime."},{"instruction":"what are the use of Hints in the animation rigging","output":"In Unity's Animation Rigging package, hints are often used to provide additional information to a constraint to improve its behavior. When you are using an inverse kinematics (IK) system, for example, you might want to ensure that a joint bends in a particular direction. Hints are especially useful in scenarios where the IK solution might be ambiguous or where there's more than one possible way a joint could bend to reach a target. Here's a practical explanation of how hints are used in a couple of common constraints: # Two Bone IK Constraint: For a Two Bone IK Constraint, which is typically used for limbs like arms or legs, the \`hint\` is an optional third bone often placed near the middle joint of a two-bone chain (like the elbow for an arm, or the knee for a leg). The purpose of the hint is to guide the direction in which the middle joint should bend when the IK is solving how to position the end effector (the hand or foot, for example). By moving the hint, you can influence the IK system's calculation, ensuring, for example, that the knee points outward rather than inward. This makes the movement look more natural or adhere to a specific motion you have in mind. # Multi-Aim Constraint: The Multi-Aim Constraint is typically used to aim a single bone at a target, which is useful for head tracking, aiming weapons, etc. When using the Multi-Aim Constraint, a hint can be used to offset the aiming direction. This might influence the direction the bone aims in addition to simply pointing straight at the target. # General Workflow: When setting up a rig that includes hints, you would generally proceed as follows: 1. Add your IK or constraint component to the appropriate GameObject in your rig hierarchy. 2. Specify the target and bones that you want to be affected. 3. If the solver supports them and the setup requires, add the hint GameObject to the provided field in the constraint's properties. 4. Position the hint in the scene such that it influences the IK joints in the desired way. 5. Adjust the weight or influence of the hint if the constraint supports this, allowing for fine-tuned control over the hint's effect. Hints are helpful tools within the Animation Rigging package and are essential when you are looking for more refined control over your procedural animations or when you're aiming for a biomechanically plausible result, such as realistic joint bending in humanoids. The exact use and setup will depend on the specific requirements of your project and the constraints you are implementing in your rig."},{"instruction":"I want the arms and shoulder to stick in position when aiming, how","output":"To keep the arms and shoulders in position when aiming in Unity, you might want to set up an Animation Rigging system that allows your character's upper body to maintain its orientation and position independently from the lower body. This can be achieved by using rig constraints that will hold the upper body in place while allowing the lower body to move. Here's a general guide to achieve this effect: 1. **Install the Animation Rigging Package** (if not already installed): - Go to \`Window -> Package Manager\`. - Select \\"Unity Registry\\" and find the \\"Animation Rigging\\" package. - Click \\"Install\\". 2. **Prepare a Rig Layer**: - Select your character GameObject in the hierarchy. The character should already have an Animator component attached. - In the Inspector, click \\"Add Component\\" and add a \`Rig Builder\`. - In the Rig Layers of the Rig Builder, click the \`+\` button to create a \`Rig\`. 3. **Add a Multi-Aim Constraint**: - Select the Rig GameObject created for the upper body and add a \`Multi-Aim Constraint\` component. - This would typically target the spine or shoulder bones so they aim at a specified point while the character is aiming a weapon. 4. **Set Up the Rig**: - In the Multi-Aim Constraint, set the \\"Aim Axis\\" to the forward direction of the spine or shoulder bones (usually the local negative Z-axis). - Create an empty GameObject to serve as the aim target, position it in the scene at the point you want the character to aim at, and then drag this GameObject into the \\"Source Object\\" slot of the Multi-Aim Constraint. 5. **Use a Two Bone IK Constraint for Arms**: - For each arm, create a Two Bone IK Constraint in the Rig to control its position. - Set the \\"Root\\", \\"Mid\\", and \\"Tip\\" to the appropriate upper arm, forearm, and hand bones, respectively. - Create targets for the hands (empties or transforms that indicate where the hands should be when aiming) and drag them into the \\"Data -> Target\\" slots of the IK constraints. - Optionally, create a hint bone or empty GameObject near each elbow to control the bend direction, and link these to the \\"Hint\\" slots of the Two Bone IK Constraints. 6. **Turn on Constraints During Aiming**: - Either by scripting or through keyframe animation in the Animator, enable or increase the weight of these constraints when entering an aiming state. This will ensure that the character's upper body and arms aim towards the target. - When not aiming, disable or lower the weight of these constraints to let the arms move freely again. 7. **Set Up Lower Body to Move Independently**: - Ensure that any animations applied to the lower body (such as walking or running) do not affect the spine upwards. To do this, you might use an Animation Layer in the Animator Controller that only affects the lower body. 8. **Fine Tune**: - Adjust the position of the aim target and hand targets to match up with the natural aiming stance of the character. - Test the setup in various scenarios to ensure that transitions into and out of the aiming state are smooth and that the holding position looks natural. 9. **Script for Gameplay**: - Tie in the aiming state activation with game logic, such as when the player presses an aim button or enters aim mode. - The script could control the weights of the Two Bone IK and Multi-Aim Constraints during gameplay. With these steps, the character's upper body should now be able to stay oriented toward the target while aiming, with arms and shoulders sticking to position, and the lower body will move more independently."},{"instruction":"I'd like you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being remarkably smelly from pooping her pants.","output":"Title: \\"The Urgent Homecoming\\" Genre: Korean Sitcom TV Series INT. MODERN KOREAN FAMILY HOUSE - DAY We open with a previous scene's recap email on screen before the show resumes: After a long morning of running errands and consuming a heavy, spicy breakfast at the market, SOO-MIN (early 20s, energetic with a short haircut and trendy, casual sportswear, not a dress nor a skirt, leggings, or jeans), experiences increasing bowel discomfort. She postpones addressing it, thinking she can make it home on time. She hustles through the streets, not noticing her key slipping out of her pocket. CUT TO: EXT.

She reaches for her keys, pats her pockets, and realizes the keys are gone. Panic-stricken, she FRANTICALLY KNOCKS on the door. SOO-MIN (in Korean, pleading) Please be home, please be home... No answer. Soo-Min's discomfort balloons to near catastrophe. INT. FAMILY HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Suddenly, we hear a voice from the other side. It's Mi-Young (50s, a youthful and vibrant mom with a permanent loving concern on her face, dressed in comfortable, well-kept home wear). MI-YOUNG (O.S., confused) Who is it?

Mi-Young, puzzled by the rush, steps in the way, instinctively reaching out to Soo-Min. MI-YOUNG (concerned) Soo-Min-ah! What's wrong? What happened? Soo-Min wriggles in her mother's grip, trying to bypass her. SOO-MIN (pleading) Mom, let me in! I need to— Their bickering escalates, intertwined in a physical and verbal tangle. Soo-Min's face contorts; she's at her limit. SOO-MIN (low guttural groan) Oh no... Mi-Young loosens her grip, her face etched with confusion. MI-YOUNG (perplexed) Soo-Min-ah? Are you sick? Soo-Min gently eases away, adopting a stance that makes her situation clear, her expression one of untimely relief. She proceeds to push, GRUNTING with mixed exertion and satisfaction. Mi-Young is rendered speechless. MI-YOUNG (voice rising) Is everything okay with you? Soo-Min utters strained replies of relief and softly grunts, betraying her state without saying it outright. INT. FAMILY HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Both women locked in an awkward moment. Mi-Young sniffing the air, grasping the situation as a pungent odor fills the space. MI-YOUNG (wrinkling her nose) What on Earth is that smell? Soo-Min looks on sheepishly, the color draining from her face as realization dawns on Mi-Young. MI-YOUNG (with disgusted bewilderment) Did you...? No, you couldn't have... Silence from Soo-Min. MI-YOUNG (more pressing, recoiling) You didn't just... poop your pants, right? Soo-Min avoids direct eye contact, the shame palpable. SOO-MIN (desperate) Can I just go inside, please? MI-YOUNG (disgusted) Oh my God! Go, but be careful with... that! Soo-Min gingerly sidesteps her mother, cupping the seat of her pants. MI-YOUNG (scolding, taunting) Stop there, Soo-Min-ah! Not a step further! Soo-Min stands frozen, indignation mixing with her shame. Mi-Young shakes her head, disgust evident. MI-YOUNG (exasperated) How can you get yourself into this mess? Are you ever going to grow up? Soo-Min pouts playfully, shaking off some embarrassment.

Gross, but—UGH, I should clean up. Before she can move, Mi-Young steps in front, mockingly scolding. MI-YOUNG (mimicking childishly) Feeling good about something dirty, are we? Mi-Young gets closer to inspect the \\"damage\\", Soo-Min protests halfheartedly. MI-YOUNG (teasing incredulously) Look at you, so proud of this nasty mess! Soo-Min touches the bulge, bickering timidly. SOO-MIN (gently arguing) It was a lot... and I really needed that relief! MI-YOUNG (mock-serious) You need more than relief. You need to act your age! As she inspects, Mi-Young makes an infantilizing gesture and sniffs near Soo-Min's pants, making a fuss. MI-YOUNG (in mock baby-talk, scrunching her nose) Such a stinky girl! Soo-Min, you're just— Soo-Min cringes, admitting her current state. SOO-MIN (lightheartedly resigned) Since you're keeping me here, let's both enjoy the \\"fragrance\\".

Spanish: \\"Hola\\" 2. French: \\"Salut\\" 3. German: \\"Hallo da\\" 4. Italian: \\"Ciao\\" 5. Japanese: \\"こんにちは\\" (Konnichiwa) - Although it means more like \\"Good day/afternoon\\", it's a common greeting. There isn't a direct equivalent to \\"there\\" in this context, but this is a friendly greeting. Note that the added \\"there\\" in English adds a casual or informal tone which may not directly translate to some other languages."},{"instruction":"Which is the hardest and easiest language to learn?","output":"The difficulty of learning a language can vary greatly depending on a learner's native language and personal language learning abilities. However, for English speakers, the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) has provided some guidelines on which languages are generally more or less challenging to learn. **Easiest Languages for English Speakers:** Languages closely related to English are often considered easier for English speakers to learn because of similar grammatical structures, vocabulary, and alphabets. Examples of these would include: 1. **Spanish** - It has straightforward pronunciation and grammar rules. 2. **Dutch** - It's grammatically similar to English and uses a lot of cognates. 3. **Norwegian** - It has a simple grammatical structure, and many words are similar to English. 4. **Swedish** - Like Norwegian, its vocabulary has many cognates with English. 5. **Afrikaans** - Known for its simplicity in terms of vocabulary and grammar. **Hardest Languages for English Speakers:** FSI ranks these languages as being exceptionally difficult for English speakers due to significant differences in grammar, writing systems, and pronunciation: 1. **Arabic** - It has a completely different script, multiple dialects, and many grammatical concepts that are unfamiliar to English speakers. 2. **Chinese (Mandarin)** - It is tonal, has thousands of characters to memorize, and offers little in the way of cognates. 3. **Japanese** - It combines three writing systems (hiragana, katakana, and kanji) and has complex honorific systems. 4. **Korean** - While it has an easier writing system than Chinese and Japanese, its grammar and sentence structure are quite different from English. 5. **Pashto, Dari, Farsi (Persian languages)** - They have a different script, and the vocabulary is quite distinct, though they are Indo-European languages, structurally different from English. Remember that the perception of difficulty is subjective, and some individuals may find particular languages easier or harder based on their unique learning styles, motivation, language exposure, and previous language learning experiences."},{"instruction":"Alright let's do this.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Korean Family Sitcom TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being remarkably smelly from pooping her pants.","output":"FADE IN: INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - DAY PREVIOUS SCENE BRIEF BACKGROUND: In the previous scene, MI-JUNG, a vibrant 27-year-old, suffered through a long and arduous day at the office with a growing need to relieve herself. Her boss's endless meetings left no time for a bathroom break. After work, she had to endure a traffic jam, and a detour took her through streets without public restrooms. The ceaseless ticking of time only heightened her need to “go.” It’s a comedic dance of discomfort as she abandons her usual subway route for a full-on sprint the last few blocks home, desperation painted across her face. EXT. FAMILY HOME - DAY The afternoon sun nestles behind a quaint two-story house. We find MI-JUNG, petite, hair in a ponytail, in athletic wear (windbreaker and loose-fitting track pants), power-walking up to the front door. She clutches her stomach, pain etching her features, eyebrows knit together in dire need. MI-JUNG (whispering to herself) Come on, Mi-Jung, just a few more seconds... Reaching the front door, Mi-Jung pats her pockets, digging for her key with increasing frenzy, patting around her body in a panicked dance. Then, the realization hits—no key. INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS FRANTIC KNOCKING resonates through the still house. Inside, JI-YOUNG (50s), Mi-Jung’s mom, elegant but casual in home clothes, head full of curlers, turns her head towards the noise, confusion spreading across her softly-lined face. JI-YOUNG (puzzled) Who could that be at this hour? EXT. FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Mi-Jung’s face contorts as she knocks harder, her other hand now firmly pressed against her backside, visibly trying to hold back nature's call. INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS JI-YOUNG approaches the door, slow with caution. JI-YOUNG (shouting) Who’s there? MI-JUNG (O.S.) (pleading) Mom, it’s me! Open up—quick! Ji-Young unlocks multiple locks with agonizing leisure as Mi-Jung’s pained GRUNTS and SHUFFLES are heard. The door finally opens a crack. INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Mi-Jung’s desperation is a physical force as she attempts to nudge past Ji-Young. MI-JUNG (strained, urgent) Move, Mom! JI-YOUNG (concerned, holding her daughter) Wait—what's wrong? MI-JUNG (frenetic) Just let me through! Their bickering crescendos as Ji-Young blocks the entrance, her grip on Mi-Jung firm. MI-JUNG (reaching a breaking point) Mom, please! Mi-Jung groans, her face a mixture of agony and premature relief, as she begins to lose control, her body tensing in a way that suggests an imminent disaster. Ji-Young’s grip loosens, eyes wide with confusion. JI-YOUNG (alarmed) Mi-Jung, what’s happeni— MI-JUNG (grunting, a hint of resolution) Shhh... almost... there... A soft series of grunts underscore the mortifying tableau, Mi-Jung's face alternating between focused discomfort and euphoric release. JI-YOUNG (utterly perplexed) Are you okay? The only answer is a drawn-out, satisfying sigh from Mi-Jung as her shoulders droop in relief. JI-YOUNG sniff the air tentatively, her nose wrinkling at the assault of an unidentifiable odor, then revisits the act with increased intensity. JI-YOUNG (recoiling) Oh, what is that smell? Mi-Jung looks up sheepishly. JI-YOUNG (disgusted realization) You didn’t just... MI-JUNG (silence, avoiding eye contact) JI-YOUNG (pressing) Did you use your pants as a toilet?! MI-JUNG (avoiding direct admission, weakly) Can I please go clean up now? Ji-Young steps aside, waving Mi-Jung through with palpable disgust and impatience. MI-JUNG enters, cupping the seat of her pants awkwardly, her gait a careful waddle. JI-YOUNG (stern, warning) Don’t you dare let any of it drop! MI-JUNG (sheepish indignation) I won’t... JI-YOUNG (taunting) Look at what a mess you've made! Mi-Jung stands frozen, the mortification evident as Ji-Young sniff the air again, grimacing. JI-YOUNG (exasperated) Will you ever grow up? MI-JUNG (playfully sulking) It’s your fault; you took forever at the door! JI-YOUNG (indignant) Excuses! Look at what you've done! MI-JUNG (insistent) I really had to go, mom! JI-YOUNG (admonishing) Act your age, Mi-Jung! Mi-Jung winces but then smirks, running her hand over the offending bulge. MI-JUNG (facetious complacency) I really needed that... But now, I should— JI-YOUNG (cutting her off, mockingly) You sound proud to be disgusting! Ji-Young grabs Mi-Jung, spinning her for inspection, incredulous at the sight. JI-YOUNG (disbelieving tease) Enjoying your 'full' experience? MI-JUNG (defensively coy) Too much needed release... JI-YOUNG (mock-firmness) No excuses for nasty behavior! She sniffs the back of Mi-Jung's pants comically, Mi-Jung cringing away. JI-YOUNG (mimicking baby-talk) Such a smelly girl you are! MI-JUNG (resigned wryness) If you insist, we'll stay like this... JI-YOUNG (scoffing) Absolutely not! To the bathroom, now! She ushers Mi-Jung, hands gingerly supporting the disaster zone, making a face at the stench. JI-YOUNG (mix of command and disgust) Don't drop any, you hear? MI-JUNG (embarrassed) Feels like it might slip... JI-YOUNG (relentless) Not on my floors! INT. FAMILY HOME - BATHROOM THRESHOLD - CONTINUOUS MI-JUNG (teasing) Need to change my 'diaper', mom? Ji-Young, at wit's end, forcefully squishes the bulge and shoves Mi-Jung into the bathroom. JI-YOUNG (plugging her nose) Get in there, clean yourself up! Mi-Jung yells as Ji-Young applies one final, exaggerated squash for emphasis. MI-JUNG (disgustedly) It’s spreading! With the bathroom door slammed after a thoroughly soiled Mi-Jung, Ji-Youngholds her nose in disgust, complaining to herself as she walks away. JI-YOUNG (talking to the air, exasperated) Adult daughter and still... so smelly! FADE TO BLACK."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Uh…where’s Yuri?

Maybe she's trying to cheer you up?\\" Monika smiles weakly, grateful for her friends' support. However, concern for Yuri still lingers in her mind. Monika: \\"I appreciate your words, guys. It does bring me some comfort. But I can't shake off this worry about Yuri. She has always been such a dedicated member of the literature club. I hope she's alright.\\" Natsuki: \\"Maybe we should try reaching out to her again. See if she responds this time? If not, we might have to take more drastic measures.\\" Sayori: \\"That's a good idea, Natsuki. Let's make sure she knows that she hasn't been forgotten. Even if she's buried in her books, she should still know that we care for her.\\" Monika nods, feeling a sense of determination. Monika: \\"You're right. We shouldn't give up on her. Yuri has always been there for us, so we should do the same for her. Let's try contacting her again and see if she responds.

Sie müssen nicht völlig automatisiert sein, aber es muss einfach sein viele videos dieser art zu erstellen. Beispiel: Reddit stories mit AI Voice und minecraft/gta gameplay drunter. Oder \\"Würdest du eher\\" video.","output":"Beim Erstellen von Inhalten für TikTok ist es wichtig, sich an die Urheberrechtsrichtlinien und die Nutzungsrichtlinien der Plattform zu halten. Automatisierte oder Massenupload-Strategien können unter Umständen gegen diese Richtlinien verstoßen. Nichtsdestotrotz gibt es verschiedene Inhaltsideen, die sich für vereinfachte oder effiziente Erstellungsprozesse eignen. Hier sind einige Beispiele: 1. **Trivia und Fakten-Videos**: Kurze und interessante Fakten aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Wissenschaft, Geschichte oder Popkultur können einfach zu erstellen sein, besonders wenn du eine Datenbank von Informationen hast, aus der ein Skript Inhalte ziehen und in einem Videoformat aufbereiten kann. 2. **AI-generierte Kunst und Animationen**: Verwenden von KI-Anwendungen, die einzigartige Kunstwerke oder Animationen erstellen. Du könntest einen Prozess einrichten, der diese Kunst automatisch generiert und als Kurzvideo präsentiert. 3. **Tier-Videos mit Voice-Over**: Eine Kombination aus kostenlos verfügbaren Tierclips und humorvollen AI-generierten Kommentaren kann zu einer unterhaltsamen Videoserie führen. 4. **AI-generierte Musikvideos**: Verwende KI-Tools zur Musikproduktion, um eigene Songs zu erstellen und diese mit einfachen, wiederkehrenden Videosequenzen zu unterlegen, zum Beispiel visualisierte Audio-Spektren oder Tanzanimationen. 5. **Motivationszitate**: Generiere motivierende Zitate oder Lebensweisheiten und präsentiere sie in einem ansprechenden Videoformat. Dabei kannst du auch visuelle KI-Tools nutzen, um passende Hintergrundbilder zu erstellen. 6. **AI-generierte Rezepte und Kochvideos**: Nutze KI, um einzigartige Rezepte zu erstellen und zeige die Zubereitung in kurzen Clips, eventuell ergänzt durch eine AI-Sprachausgabe, die durch den Prozess führt. 7. **Virtuelle Reisevideos**: Nutze Bilder und Videos von Sehenswürdigkeiten aus aller Welt, kombiniert mit faszinierenden Fakten oder einer erzählenden AI-Stimme, um eine Serie von virtuellen Reisen zu kreieren. 8. **Tägliche Herausforderungen**: Starte eine Serie, in der du tägliche Herausforderungen stellst, die von den Zuschauern umgesetzt werden sollen. Die Inhalte können schriftlich vorgegeben und mit generischen Videos unterlegt werden. 9. **Zeitraffer-Videos**: Erstelle Videos von Pflanzenwachstum, Wetteränderungen oder Stadtleben im Zeitraffer. Mit einer festen Kamera können im Laufe der Zeit viele solcher Clips produziert werden. Wenn du diese Arten von Inhalten erstellst, denke darüber nach, wie du deine Videos optimieren und dein Publikum am besten einbinden kannst. Es ist wichtig, dass deine Inhalte nicht nur einfach zu erstellen, sondern auch interessant und ansprechend für deine Zuschauer sind. Berücksichtige stets die \\"Community Guidelines\\" von TikTok, um sicherzustellen, dass du die Plattform verantwortungsvoll nutzt."},{"instruction":"Ich bin ein weißer Mann. Gib mir bitte mehr videos, die in richtung meiner Beispiele gehen. Wo man ein festes format hat, aber einfach immer andere Inhalte einfügt.","output":"Verstehe, du suchst also nach Ideen für Content-Formate, die skalierbar und wiederholbar sind, bei denen du mit einem festen Rahmen unterschiedliche Inhalte präsentieren kannst. Hier sind einige Ideen, die in diese Richtung gehen: 1. **Top-Listen und Ranglisten**: Erstelle Videos über Top 10-Listen oder Ranglisten in verschiedenen Kategorien, z. B. \\"Top 10 unerklärliche Phänomene\\", \\"Top 5 Fußballmomente der Woche\\" etc. Du kannst diese Listen entweder selbst zusammenstellen oder auf bestehende Quellen zurückgreifen und für jedes Listenelement einen kurzen Clip oder eine Bilderstrecke zeigen. 2. **Täglicher Vlog mit AI-Inhalten**: Wähle ein tägliches Thema und lass eine AI (Künstliche Intelligenz) einen kurzen Text dazu generieren. Diesen kannst du dann als Voice-Over für ein Video nehmen, das passende Bilder oder Animationen zeigt. 3. **Meme-Rezensionen**: Präsentiere täglich oder wöchentlich aktuelle Memes, die du im Internet findest. Deine eigene Bewertung und ein Kommentar dazu können dem Video eine persönliche Note geben. 4. **Automatisierte Nachrichtenrückblicke**: Nutze Nachrichtenfeeds, um Tageszusammenfassungen zu generieren. Du könntest AI-Tools verwenden, um die wichtigsten Nachrichten des Tages zu extrahieren und kurze Videoclips dazu zu erstellen. 5. **Speedruns oder Gaming-Highlights**: Wenn du ein Gamer bist, könntest du tägliche oder wöchentliche Highlights deiner besten Spielzüge zeigen. Für den Automatisierungsaspekt könntest du ein Programm oder Skript schreiben, das bestimmte Ereignisse im Spiel erkennt und aufzeichnet. 6. **Buch- oder Filmzusammenfassungen**: Verwende eine KI, um Zusammenfassungen von Büchern oder Filmen zu erstellen. Visualisiere diese mit relevanten Bildern oder Szenen und einem Voice-Over. 7. **Wissensfragen und Quizze**: Erstelle eine Serie von kurzen Quiz- oder Wissensfrage-Videos, bei denen die Antworten in einem nachfolgenden Video präsentiert werden. Dies fördert die Interaktion und ermutigt die Zuschauer, für die Antworten zurückzukehren. 8. **Lerninhalte und Mini-Tutorials**: Biete kurze Lektionen oder Anleitungen zu verschiedenen Themen an – von Sprachen über Programmierung bis hin zum Kochen. Du könntest eine KI verwenden, um die Informationen vorzubereiten und dann einfache Diashows oder Bildschirmaufnahmen als Visuals nutzen. 9. **Vorher-Nachher-Videos**: Zeige Verwandlungen jeder Art – von Fitnessfortschritten über Renovierungen bis hin zu digitalen Bildbearbeitungen. Die konstante Struktur lässt Raum für viel Varianz im \\"Inhalt\\" der Verwandlungen. 10. **TikTok-Reaktionen und Kommentare**: Interagiere mit deinen Followern, indem du auf deren Kommentare oder Videoanfragen mit eigenen Clips antwortest. Dies regt zu weiterer Interaktion an und kann zu einer Serie ausgebaut werden, in der du auf Kommentare reagierst oder Fragen beantwortest. Bei der Erstellung dieser Inhalte solltest du darauf achten, das Urheberrecht und die Plattformrichtlinien zu beachten. Autoren- und Künstlerrechte sind auch bei der Verwendung von AI-generierten Inhalten zu respektieren, und der Nutzwert für dein Publikum sollte stets im Vordergrund stehen."},{"instruction":"very nice thank you.

Please include every event and dialoge that I describe as part of the scene's prompt sequence in the final output, and combine all the events and dialogues that I provide in the following part of my prompt into one whole screenplay/shooting script that is coherent, logically consistent and that flows naturally. Please ensure that the scene, its contents and the interactions within it develop organically and realistically in the final output. Please ensure that the scene's characters are compelling and that they act in accordance with their presumed traits and cultural background. Please refrain from portraying the cultural background in overtly stereotypical fashion; instead, reflect the characters' cultural background with an adequate degree of nuance. Please ensure that all of the scene's dialogues are in logical accordance with the scene's sequence of events and that the dialogues' contents all follow from one another; that the dialogues' contents make sense within the situations that occur in the scene; and that the dialogues' contents fit the characters' cultural backgrounds, as well as the scene's genre and situational context as far as usage of vernacular and dialect is concerned. The way in which the characters speak needs to be derived from their character traits, their cultural background and the scene's genre conventions. Please elaborate in detail on all events and dialogues that occur during the entirety of the scene, and don't write any part of the scene in brevity when providing the final output. In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Korean Sitcom TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being remarkably smelly from pooping her pants.","output":"INT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - DAY FADE IN: BACKSTORY NARRATION: Earlier today, YEON-SOOK (26), a quick-tempered and often absent-minded young woman, sat through an excruciatingly long business meeting that extended well past lunchtime. With her stomach rumbling and the urge mounting, Yeon-sook dodged out of the office — too embarrassed to use the public restroom — and began her race home. But with traffic conspiring against her and her desperation crescendoing, she finds herself right where we catch up with her now... EXT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY Yeon-sook, an athletic woman in her mid-twenties with short, stylishly tousled hair, is seen speed-walking towards a traditional Korean family home. She's dressed in a smart casual button-up blouse and loose-fitting, drawstring linen trousers, the apparent comfort of her attire offering no solace to her current predicament. As she finally reaches the front door, Yeon-sook pats her pockets in percussion, a rhythm of rising panic, before realizing with horror that her house key is missing. She pounds urgently on the door with a strained expression that screams silent catastrophe. YEON-SOOK: (whispering) Oh no, no, no... A few heart-thumping moments pass in vain. With every second her brow furrows deeper, her well of patience hemorrhaging away as if in tandem with her ability to hold in her agony. INT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS From the inside, we hear the scuffing of slippers against the wooden floor. The voice of MI-JA, Yeon-sook's mom, mid-fifties with streaks of wisdom in her hair but a spritely nature, can be heard through the door. MI-JA (O.S.) Who is it? What's all the commotion? EXT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Yeon-sook begins hopping in place, her urgency on full display. YEON-SOOK: Eomma, it's me. Hurry! The sound of locks unlatching and the door creaking its way open fills the tense air. MI-JA, with her apron dusted in flour, appears perplexed at her daughter’s fervent behavior. MI-JA: Yeon-sook-ah, what's— YEON-SOOK: (out of breath) Move, please! Yeon-sook tries to hustle past MI-JA, but she's caught in a motherly deadlock as Mi-ja’s arms firmly wrap around her, sensing that something's amiss. MI-JA: (concerned) What happened? Are you okay? YEON-SOOK: (desperate) I'm fine, just let me go to the... Just let me in! Their bodies entangled in a tango of tension, mother and daughter grapple as the conversation becomes a rapid-fire exchange of pleas and queries. Yeon-sook, with every escaping second, feels her control slipping away. She groans, her face morphing into an image of concentrated horror as she starts to relieve herself. The grappling previously vigorous, weakens into stillness. MI-JA: (baffled) What's wrong, Yeon-sook-ah? Yeon-sook, sheepishly stepping back, silently maneuvers herself into a slight squat, her eyes portray an acceptance of defeat yet an odd satisfaction in the discharge. YEON-SOOK: (voice strained) It's okay... I'm okay. A strand of strained grunts, initially hinting at pain, quickly weaves into a fabric of relief. Mi-ja's expression oscillates between concern and utter befuddlement. MI-JA But you're... Are you sure you're— A putrid scent permeates the entryway, and Mi-ja’s puzzled look is soon replaced by a realization of revulsion as she sniffs the air, her face progressing from confused sniffs to recoiled acknowledgment. MI-JA (gagging slightly) What is that smell? Yeon-sook offers a feeble, mortified smile, unable to respond. MI-JA: (grimacing) Did you just... No, you didn't! You couldn't have! YEON-SOOK: (pleadingly) Can I please just go inside now? Still processing the absurdity of the situation, Mi-ja steps aside with a disgusted wave. YEON-SOOK waddles inside, hands cradling the now evidently heavier seat of her pants, her attempt at dignity as successful as her bowel control. MI-JA (haltingly) Wait, don't you move! Not a step further—no mess on the floor. Yeon-sook stops short, her sheepishness now mixed with an air of sass. MI-JA: (teasingly scornful) Look at you, such a mess! When will you grow up, huh? YEON-SOOK: (defensive) Hey! If you hadn't taken an eternity to open up and then block my way, none of this would've happened! MI-JA rebuffs her daughter’s playful blame-shifting with a scoff. MI-JA: That's no excuse for a grown woman, Yeon-sook. YEON-SOOK: (arms crossed, disgruntled) I had to go so bad, Eomma! Once it started, I couldn't stop it, okay? And it's all because you delayed and blocked the path! YEON-SOOK caresses the bulge in her pants with feigned contentment, masking her embarrassment. YEON-SOOK: (reluctant admittance) Though... it did feel good to let it out, I guess. Gotta clean up now... As she shuffles towards the bathroom, pent-up tension has Mi-ja catching her by the arm. MI-JA: (snarkily) Good? There's nothing good about pooping your pants, you nastiness! YEON-SOOK tries to protest, but Mi-ja spins her around for a closer, taunting inspection of her soiled pants, humor and disbelief struck across her face. MI-JA: (chidingly) With that amount, it's like you enjoyed it, huh? What, is this fun for you? YEON-SOOK: (fidgeting uncomfortably) It’s not about fun... It had to come out. Needed... relief. MI-JA: (sardonically) If you're so content like a toddler with their pants full, then I'll treat you like one. Mi-ja, in a mock maternal manner, goes so far as to sniff near the soiled seat, eliciting a cringe from Yeon-sook, before jesting with exaggerated grimaces and baby talk. MI-JA: (teasingly childish) Eww, someone's a stinky little girl! YEON-SOOK: (with a veneer of lightheartedness) If you’re keeping me here, then we might as well enjoy the smell together. MI-JA: (firmly) Enough. I won't let you stand there smelling up the place; off to the bathroom with you! The pair progress comically toward the bathroom, Mi-ja's hand gingerly helping to confine the contents of Yeon-sook's pants. MI-JA: (cautioning) Don't you dare drop anything... YEON-SOOK: (nervously) Feels like it's going to... Splashes of comical disgust and embarrassment paint the scene as they finally reach the bathroom door. YEON-SOOK: (teasingly insolent) Will Eomma change my 'poopy diaper'? Grappling with the climax of her incredulity and frustration, Mi-ja musters a playful retaliation, grasping the bulge in Yeon-sook's pants and shoving her towards the bathroom. MI-JA: (playfully reprimanding) In you go, Miss Dirty! No more nonsense! As Yeon-sook is shoved in, she half screams, half laughs at the ludicrous situation. YEON-SOOK: (disgustedly) Eomma! MI-JA: (lightheartedly scolding) That's what you get. Now clean yourself up! Closing the bathroom door on her chaos-conjuring daughter, Mi-ja ambles away, muttering and waving her free hand to dispel the lingering odor of an unforgettable afternoon. FADE OUT. THE END"},{"instruction":"Tell me about Titan, a submersible for deep-sea tourism.","output":"Titan is a submersible designed for deep-sea tourism by the company OceanGate Expeditions.

Completing your assessment What am I required to do on this assessment? This is an individual assignment requiring you to design and prototype a web application – an App based on data from Open Data Bristol. The assignment requires you to carry out design work to a high standard and exemplify professional practice by giving and receiving feedback. Working on this assignment will help you to plan, conduct, critique and iteratively improve your research, design, and coding artifacts. This portfolio is comprised of four separate subtasks, based on the first four stages of the design process (empathise, define, ideate, prototype). Each one is worth 25% of the available marks. Please Make sure you include a cover page with your name and student number Please identify which dataset from Open Data Bristol you are using (name and URL). Reference your sources using UWE Harvard referencing. Where should I start? This is the task breakdown: 1: Empathise You will create a mood board containing representative photos, colours, fonts, and reference designs using Figma. This section should be around 500 words including: A collage of photos that represent your project A colour theme based on these photos A selection of Sample fonts and font pairs using foreground/background colours A small set of reference designs Please export images (e.g. png) from Figma and incorporate them into your Word document. 2: Define You will define the User Experience (UX) mapping, defining a persona and an associated scenario represented as a design map. This section should be around 500 words including: A persona you are targeting, identifying their goals and frustrations. Outline a scenario – a design map showing the touch-points where your persona interacts with the App. 3: Ideate You will capture your user interface as a wireframe. Use wireflow to indicate flow between screens. This section should be around 500 words including: A screen capture of your wireframe(s). Analysis of the Information Architecture of your wireframe(s) including Organisation, Labeling, Navigation, Search. Include a blueprint diagram representing your organisational hierarchy. 4: Prototype You will construct an interactive functional prototype of your App. This will be one or more static web-pages that run in the browser, created using HTML and CSS. It should be clickable/navigable, but as a prototype, it need not be fully functional. It should use embedded iframes from Open Data Bristol for tables and maps. Your prototype should include interactive controls to select between different content. The design should follow from your earlier design ideas, using the colours and fonts set out in your mood board, and layout ideas from your wireframe. If your ideas have evolved, then please explain how and why. This section should be around 500 words including: Screenshots of your HTML prototype. A step-by-step walkthrough of your scenario in relation to these screenshots. A description of the CSS styling used. You will submit your portfolio as a single Word document with four subheadings: 1.Empathise 2.Define 3.Ideate 4.Prototype What do I need to do to pass? The pass mark is 50%. How do I achieve high marks in this assessment? We are looking for professional levels of design, not sophisticated levels of coding. This will include a photographic collage with a good range of contrasting colours in the colour theme. Excellent font pairings with a good selection of reference images. You will develop a fully rounded persona, with an excellent user-centred scenario offering a resolution to the persona’s needs and frustrations. This will be matched by clear wireframing, comparable to sites you would find on the web. You will carry out a detailed analysis of the Information Architecture. The design of the prototype will look fabulous and show clear links back to the UX mapping and wireframe, and using a colour scheme selected from your moodboard. You will use UWE/Harvard referencing throughout. Marks and Feedback Your assessment will be marked according to the following marking criteria.

Choose Your Dataset from Open Data Bristol: - Start by browsing the Open Data Bristol site to select a dataset that interests you and can serve as the basis for your app design. - Make note of the URL and the type of data available. 2. Empathise - Create a Mood Board (500 words): - Explore images, color themes, font styles, and design references that resonate with the theme of your chosen dataset. - Use Figma to create a collage of photos, select a color scheme, choose sample fonts and font pairings, and compile reference designs. - Export the mood board as images from Figma and insert them into your Word document. - Write a description of each element of your mood board (why you chose them, how they relate to your project, etc.). 3. Define - UX Mapping (500 words): - Develop a persona who will be the target user of your app. Describe their characteristics, goals, and frustrations. - Craft a scenario in which your persona interacts with the app, highlighting key touchpoints. - Create a design map to illustrate this scenario, detailing each step of interaction. - Document the process in your Word document, including the persona’s description and the design map. 4. Ideate - Wireframe and Information Architecture (500 words): - Sketch wireframes of your app’s user interface. It can be done on paper and then digitized, or use wireframing tools directly. - Indicate the flow between the app’s screens with a wireflow diagram. - Analyze the Information Architecture of your app concerning organization, labeling, navigation, and search. - Include a blueprint diagram to showcase your app’s organizational hierarchy. - Add screen capture(s) of your wireframe(s) to your Word document and describe your analysis. 5. Prototype - Build an Interactive Prototype (500 words): - Using HTML and CSS, create a static but interactive prototype of your app that can run in a browser. - It should incorporate embedded iframes from Open Data Bristol to show data tables and maps. - Ensure that the design follows your mood board and wireframe, and is clickable/navigable. - Take screenshots of your prototype in action and insert them into your document. - Write a walkthrough of your scenario using these screenshots and elaborate on the CSS styling used. Now, I want to build a web app to help users locate electric vehicle charging stations. Define Stage Persona: Name: Emily Carter Age: 37 Job Title: Marketing Manager Location: Bristol High tech savvy Car ownership: Tesla Model 3 owner Lifestyle: Environmentalist, city worker, suburban Bristol resident, frequents business meetings and weekend trips by car. Needs/Pains: Goal is to seamlessly integrate charging into her daily routine without delays or disruptions. Find reliable charging stations near frequent destinations. Plan longer trips without worrying about running out of charge. Access to fast charging on tight schedules. Challenges finding charging stations in unfamiliar city areas. Insufficient real-time charging station availability and operation data. Solutions: Map all Bristol electric vehicle charging stations and display real-time availability.  An interactive map could filter by charger type (fast, rapid, slow), electric vehicle compatibility, and nearby amenities like cafes, restrooms, and shopping.  Users may receive proactive notifications about their usual stations or when a previously occupied station becomes available.  The app's trip planner lets users enter their route and find charging points with estimated charging times.  The platform could reserve charging slots for a specific time to ensure availability upon arrival.  A system for reporting station issues would allow users to share status updates, improving service reliability.  Calendar app integration to suggest pre-scheduled charging times based on user itinerary and charging history.  The app could offer discounts or benefits to frequent users through a rewards programme.  Emily's confidence in long-distance travel could be boosted by an in-app assistance or community forum for instant help and tips from other electric vehicle users. Scenario: Emily has a busy day ahead with an early meeting in the city center, followed by a client lunch on the other side of town, and an evening networking event near the marina. She wants to ensure her Tesla has enough charge for the day’s activities and potentially a weekend getaway. Design Map Steps (With electronic post its) 1. Emily opens the app first thing in the morning and inputs her day’s destinations into the trip planner. (User needs established destinations and schedule. 2. The app displays optimal charging points along her route and She chooses a fast charger near her first meeting location. (Even with live updates, charging stations may be occupied. Consider adding a historical “busy times” feature to predict station occupancy.) 3. After her meeting, Emily receives a notification that her car is fully charged, and the app updates her on the status of charging stations near her next destination. (Real-time notifications improve user experience. We assume users have their tablets/phones after meetings. Setting quiet hours for meeting notifications is suggested.) 4. Emily stops at the charger identified by the app, the charging process is swift. The charging process is swift, so she proceeds to the marina with plenty of charge left. (Partnerships with nearby businesses can provide short-term benefits during charging. We assume the Rapid chargers work.) Ideation stage During Ideation, we focus on creating a web app UI concept. This app will help Emily find EV charging stations faster. Wireframes and wireflow diagrams show the app's layout and user journey. We'll review the app's Information Architecture (IA) to ensure its organisation, labelling, navigation, and search functions are easy to use. Diagram showing information flow: The home screen has simple options like 'Find Charging Station,' 'Plan Trip,' 'My Account,' and 'Community.' When the user selects 'Find Charging Station,' a map view shows nearby stations. The'Plan Trip' option opens a trip planner where you can enter your destinations and view a mapped route with charging points. 'My Account' displays personal settings and usage history, while 'Community' allows user interaction. Information Architecture Analysis: 1. Structure: The app has four main sections to improve user experience. Home is the hub for all features. The Charging Stations section is visually appealing, and the detailed view pages provide detailed information about each station. Trip Planner provides route planning, scheduling, and station pre-booking in one tool. The Community Hub promotes user engagement and information sharing. 2. Classification: Labels clarify and aid comprehension. 'Find Charging Station' is a simple and effective way to inform users of charging station locations. 'Plan Trip' plans trips, including charging stops. 'My Account' is a well-known way to access personal settings and histories. In 'community', ideas and wisdom are shared dynamically. 3. Navigation: The main navigation menu is consistent across all screens, making core functions easy to access. A one-handed bottom navigation bar makes tablets / mobile devices easy to use. Breadcrumbs help you retrace your steps in the trip planner and station details without losing your input data. 4. Search: The home screen's global search lets users find what they need by entering an address, attraction, or station name. Autocomplete suggestions speed up charging station and trip planning. Users can filter search results by charger type, availability, and amenities. An iterative design process used user and stakeholder feedback to create wireframes and wireflows. We developed the current efficient information architecture after interacting with users like Emily and realising the importance of a simple yet effective design. Highlights include: An easily accessible map on the home screen provides station details with one tap. Clear visual indicators distinguish charging stations. A simple trip planner that lets you change your route. Easily accessible community insights allow users to upvote or downvote content to encourage helpful contributions. Clear structure, easy-to-understand labels, simple navigation, and robust search capabilities make the UI user-friendly and efficient. The app constantly refines and uses an adaptable development approach to ensure users can easily find their next charging point with a few taps. Like the vehicles it serves, the EV station finder app is reliable and responsive. Now i want you to fully generate the codes for the prototype. Design specifications and Content: The page has “EV Charging Station Locator” on the top middle of the page. It has a Search bar (with a “search” placeholder) with a dropdown button beside it for different search filters like “Fast charging” and “Normal Charging” It has an icon of a charging car at the topleft corner of the page.

This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. Original prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Read the speech carefully. Then write an essay in which you analyze the rhetorical strategies Kelley uses to convey her message about child labor to her audience. Support your analysis with specific references to the text. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

Through the use of vivid imagery, strategic repetition, anaphora, and pointed rhetorical questions, Kelley not only informs her audience of the dire conditions faced by child laborers but also appeals to their emotions and logic to ignite a shared sense of responsibility and call to action. Kelley's deliberate depiction of the night-time toils of children in textile mills lays bare the severity of their exploitation. By detailing how \\"several thousand little girls will be working all the night through in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms,\\" Kelley paints a stark, unsettling image of the harsh environment in which these children labor. This description not only serves to inform but also to stir feelings of empathy within the audience. Her choice of words, specifically \\"little girls\\" and \\"all the night through,\\" underscores the innocence and vulnerability of the children, thereby evoking a potent emotional reaction from the listeners. The strategic repetition of phrases like \\"the children\\" and \\"they\\" throughout Kelley's speech functions as a linguistic tool to underscore the pervasiveness of child labor across various industries. She cites how children are involved in the production of shoes, stockings, underwear, and even decorative elements such as hatpins, hammering her point home through anaphora. This consistent recurrence serves a dual purpose: it emphasizes the expansive scope of the issue while making the information more memorable to an audience receiving it orally. By doing so, Kelley ensures that her message about child labor resonates beyond the convention and drives home the systematic exploitation children face. Kelley's use of rhetorical questions is particularly astute, as it directly challenges the audience to contemplate the incongruities and injustices within their society. She provokes deeper thought by questioning whether legislative decisions would differ if disenfranchised groups, such as mothers and teachers, were given the right to vote. This rhetorical maneuver not only invites listeners to reflect on societal shortcomings but also suggests that empowering women with suffrage could bring about legislative reforms to protect children. Such questions link the fight against child labor with the broader campaign for women's suffrage, binding together critical social issues and presenting a unified front for change. The speech culminates in a call to enlist the support of workingmen for the cause of enfranchisement as a strategy to free children from the clutches of labor. Kelley presents this as a tangible course of action, providing a hopeful avenue for her audience to engage with and advocate for change. By connecting the emancipation of children with the broader goals of the suffrage movement, she highlights the intersectionality of social reform, framing the issue in a way that appeals to a wider range of civic-minded individuals. In conclusion, Kelley’s speech exemplifies a masterful use of rhetorical devices, mapped out carefully to enhance her argument’s conviction and potency. Her vivid descriptions, anaphoric repetition, and incisive rhetorical questions coalesce to produce an impactful oration. This speech not only conveys Kelley's message about child labor but also enkindles a compelling case for the suffrage of women as a means to societal reform, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the connective tissue between these crucial social issues."},{"instruction":"How would American Tribespeople react to a multifaceted depiction of say, the Cherokee and the Shawnee, with multiple characters having moments of romance/love, fear, doubt, anger, heroics, and evil?","output":"It is difficult to generalize how American tribespeople, such as those from the Cherokee and Shawnee nations, would react to a multifaceted depiction of their people in media or literature, as reactions would vary among individuals based on personal beliefs, cultural connection, and sensitivities towards representation. However, many Indigenous peoples seek authentic and nuanced representations that respect their culture, history, and contemporary issues. Multidimensional character portrayals that showcase a range of human experiences and emotions can be a positive step away from the oversimplified and often stereotyped portrayals that have historically dominated media. Considerations that might affect their reaction include: 1. **Accuracy and Respect:** If the depiction is well-researched and accurately represents the cultures, beliefs, and customs of the Cherokee and Shawnee people, it is more likely to be well-received. This includes respecting sacred traditions and not disclosing or misrepresenting cultural aspects that are not meant to be shared with outsiders. 2. **Consultation and Involvement:** If tribal members were consulted and involved in the creation of these depictions, it would likely be appreciated. This collaboration can provide a layer of authenticity and demonstrate respect for the represented communities. 3. **Diversity of Representation:** As with any group, there is diversity within tribes. Depicting a range of characters with various personalities and experiences can help break down monolithic stereotypes about Native Americans. 4. **Purpose and Context:** The reasons behind the portrayal and its context can influence reactions as well. If the representations serve to educate, raise awareness, or tell a story that has not been told before, that may be seen as valuable. However, if the representation is perceived as exploitative or sensationalist, it could be met with disapproval. 5. **Stereotypes and Clichés:** Avoiding clichéd or stereotypical characters (such as the \\"noble savage\\" or the \\"Indian princess\\") is crucial. Authentic characters who experience a range of emotions and have complex personalities are more likely to be seen positively. 6. **Cultural Impact:** The potential impact on the wider public's perception of these tribes could affect the tribespeople's reactions. Positive and complex depictions can help combat existing stereotypes and lead to greater understanding and respect. 7. **Personal Identification:** Individuals may react based on how well they personally identify with the characters and situations depicted. This can vary widely even within a community. 8. **Agency and Voice:** Giving characters from these communities agency and a voice in their stories is also important. It can be empowering to see tribal characters portrayed as heroes of their own stories rather than as side characters in someone else's narrative. It is worth noting that there is no monolithic \\"American tribespeople\\" voice or reaction; there are many different tribal nations, each with unique cultures and perspectives. Within any given community, you will find a range of opinions, and it is important to recognize that individual members of the Cherokee or Shawnee may have varying responses to such portrayals."},{"instruction":"Rewrite the given essay to meet objectives in the rubric, while keeping as much of the original language and argument of the writer: While we sleep, several thousands of children will be working through the night to produce the clothes that we buy.

Original prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

Employing vivid imagery, strategic repetition, and penetrating rhetorical questions, Kelley not only illustrates the iniquity faced by working children but also harnesses these elements to argue for the enfranchisement of women as a vital step toward reform. This essay will explore Kelley's adept use of these rhetorical strategies and dissect their effectiveness in context, arguing that they serve not only to convey her message but also to empower her audience to seek change. Kelley's deliberate use of vivid descriptions serves a dual purpose: to confront her listeners with the stark conditions of child labor and to evoke a visceral emotional response. Her searing depiction of \\"little girls... working in textile mills, all the night through, in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms\\" powerfully conveys the unnatural and oppressive environment in which these children toil. It is a scene so antithetical to the idyll of childhood that it demands the audience's empathy and galvanizes support for Kelley's cause. These graphic images emphasize the severity of the issue, impressing upon the audience the urgency of reform and the need for their participation. Strategically, Kelley wields the repetition of specific words and sentence structures to hammer home her message. Constantly referring to the laborers as \\"children\\" and \\"they,\\" Kelley ensures that her audience cannot divorce the human element from the conversation about labor practices. By repeatedly starting sentences with these terms, such as in the passage where she lists the various items children produce for the benefit of adults, Kelley reinforces the idea that every product carries the weight of a child's lost education and freedom. This relentless recurrence serves to make her speech memorable and more impactful, especially given that her audience were absorbing her words aurally, rather than through text. Moreover, Kelley's use of rhetorical questions cuts to the core of her listener's moral conscience and societal role. By asking, \\"If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age?\\" Kelley not only underscores the injustice but also plants the seeds of potential power in her audience – the power of suffrage. Her questions are a clarion call to consider alternative realities where enfranchised women could effectuate change, thus advocating for women's suffrage as an indispensable tool in combatting child labor. In conclusion, Kelley’s rhetorical choices in her 1905 speech play an instrumental role in driving her argument and painting the distressing portrait of child labor that fueled her reformist fire. Her vivid descriptions, persistent repetition, and sharp rhetorical questions interact to ensure that the poignant message resonates with her audience, encouraging them to internalize her urgent plea for social reform and expanded woman suffrage. This sophisticated approach not only underscores Kelley’s deep understanding of the issues at hand but also her calculated command of rhetoric to catalyze a movement grounded firmly on empathy and justice."},{"instruction":"etymology of \\"Вижниця\\"","output":"\\"Вижниця\\" (pronounced veezh-neet-syah) is a town in the Chernivtsi Oblast of western Ukraine. The etymology of the name \\"Вижниця\\" is not entirely clear, but it likely has Slavic roots, given the linguistic and historical context of the region. There are a few theories about the origin of the name: 1. The name might have been derived from the Slavic root \\"виж-\\" which could be related to the verb \\"виждати\\" (vyzhdaty) meaning \\"to wait\\" or \\"to expect.\\" This could potentially be connected to a place where people waited, such as a trading post or a river crossing. 2. Another possibility is that the name comes from a personal name, as Slavic toponyms often originated from the names of individuals who owned the land, founded, or were otherwise associated with the settlement. 3. The name could also have originated from the Slavic word \\"вежа\\" (vezha), which means \\"tower\\" or \\"watchtower,\\" perhaps suggesting the presence of a watchtower in the ancient settlement. Determining the exact origin of the name would require a specialized historical and linguistic investigation, including examination of old documents and maps that reference the town. Keep in mind that many place names in Eastern Europe have complex histories due to the region's diverse linguistic and cultural influences, including Slavic, Romanian, Hungarian, Turkish, and others, depending on the specific location and time period."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello! It seems that your latest message came through without content. If you have any more questions or need assistance with another topic, feel free to ask!"},{"instruction":"Etymology of \\"Wischnitzer\\"","output":"Wischnitzer is a surname that likely has geographic origins, derived from the name of the town of Vyzhnytsia (Вижниця in Ukrainian), located in the Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine. As with many surnames based on place names, individuals or families were often identified by the town or region from which they came, particularly when they moved to new areas. This practice was a common way to distinguish people with the same first name in the days before surnames were standardized. The surname Wischnitzer would have been typically assumed by people who lived in, came from, or had some connection to this town or the surrounding area. The spelling variations of the surname, such as Wischnitzer, Vizhnitzer, or Wischnitz, reflect the transliteration from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet and the influence of different languages spoken in the region over time, including Ukrainian, Yiddish, German, and Romanian. Jews from Eastern Europe, for instance, might have adopted a variation of this surname based on the Yiddish pronunciation of the town's name. As these communities emigrated, the surname would become established in the diaspora. It is important to note that surnames can undergo numerous changes over time and across different countries because of immigration, transliteration, and language shifts, which can sometimes make tracing the exact etymology of a surname challenging."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

Kelley strategically mobilizes vivid descriptions, repetitive diction, parallel sentence structures, and penetrating rhetorical questions, effectively heightening the urgency of her argument and rallying support for her cause. Kelley's deliberate employment of graphic imagery captures the harrowing conditions under which countless children labor. For instance, her evocative depiction—“Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy”—operates on both an emotional and intellectual level. The audience cannot help but visualize these young girls, a potent image that underscores the iniquity of the system. This unflinching portrayal works to galvanize the audience's empathy and sense of justice, driving them to consider their complicity in perpetuating child labor. Furthermore, Kelley's insistent repetition of \\"children\\" and \\"they\\" throughout her speech, coupled with anaphora, reinforces the prevalence and normality of the situation. This literary strategy amplifies the scale of the issue as illustrated by Kelley’s enumeration: “The children make our shoes...they knit our stockings...they spin and weave.” The repetitive syntax not only makes the speech rhythmically compelling but also underscores the persistent exploitation, ensuring that it resonates in the consciousness of the listeners. Such a targeted rhetorical approach aids Kelley in emphasizing the collective responsibility to challenge and to transform the current labor practices. Moreover, Kelley’s skillful use of rhetorical questions acts as a catalyst for social change, poking at the listeners' moral sensibilities and igniting their political will. Kelley asks, \\"If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused... to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age?” These probing inquiries are not intended for the audience to answer, but to ponder deeply the link between disenfranchisement and legislative indifference. They highlight the unjust circumstances and suggest women’s suffrage as a powerful tool for societal improvement. By intimating the transformative potential of the female vote, Kelley not only illuminates the connection between suffrage and labor law reform but also calls into question the integrity of existing political structures. In sum, Kelley’s speech demonstrates an adroit usage of rhetorical strategies that underscore both the pervasiveness and the severity of child labor at the time. By painting a stark picture of the exploitation, repetitively reminding her audience of their regular contribution to this system, and invoking the potential impact of political action, she effectively pitches a cogent and convincing argument. Kelley’s rhetorical choices reflect a deep understanding of her audience and the situation at hand and showcase her capacity to compel others to think, feel, and, ultimately, act. Her nuanced delivery presents a vivid, persuasive response that resonates with the audience, moving them one step closer toward advocating for the rights of children and women alike."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They differ primarily in how they manage connections and execute commands. These differences affect how they pull down the cluster nodes (i.e., how they retrieve information about the nodes in a Redis cluster). Here's a summary of the differences between Jedis and Lettuce related to retrieving the cluster nodes information: 1. **Connection Handling**: - **Jedis**: It is known for a straightforward and synchronous blocking I/O. It does not natively support asynchronous operations. When you connect to a Redis cluster using Jedis, it creates connections to all master nodes and keeps them. These connections are mostly dedicated to the specific node and are not thread-safe. - **Lettuce**: It uses a netty-based, non-blocking, and asynchronous event-driven architecture. Lettuce supports synchronous and asynchronous operations along with reactive streams. Connections in Lettuce are thread-safe and can be used by multiple threads concurrently. 2. **Retrieving Cluster Information**: - **Jedis**: When you request the cluster nodes information using Jedis (for example, by using \`jedis.clusterNodes()\`), Jedis sends a \`CLUSTER NODES\` command to the connected Redis node, which returns the current cluster configuration including all nodes and their states. Jedis parses this information into a data structure within the client. - **Lettuce**: With Lettuce, when you reach out for cluster information (such as by using \`cluster.getPartitions()\`), it also issues a similar \`CLUSTER NODES\` command or \`CLUSTER SLOTS\`. However, due to its asynchronous nature, it can provide the cluster topology refresh in a non-blocking fashion. The partitions or slots information is managed and can be automatically updated in the background. 3. **Cluster Topology Refresh**: - **Jedis**: Since Jedis is synchronous, if the cluster topology changes (nodes added or removed, or the hash slots mapping changes), you need to handle this manually or through additional tooling to refresh the cluster information. Jedis provides limited capabilities for handling topology changes automatically. - **Lettuce**: Lettuce features an auto-reconnect and cluster topology refresh capability. It can automatically detect changes in the cluster and refresh its internal representation of the cluster topology. 4. **Fault Tolerance**: - **Jedis**: Jedis leaves it to the user to implement failover logic, such as retrying failed commands on different nodes. - **Lettuce**: It provides more robust fault tolerance features such as retry mechanisms and master/slave failover support. When it comes to pulling down the cluster nodes from Redis, both clients essentially perform the same function but in different manners as dictated by their architectural differences. Lettuce might be the better choice for a more complex, multi-threaded application because of how it handles connections and communicates with the cluster. However, if your use case is simple and synchronous operations suffice, Jedis might be more straightforward to use."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"When deciding between Jedis and Lettuce for pulling down cluster information or any other operations with Redis, consider the following additional points: 5. **Code Complexity and Maintenance**: - **Jedis**: Utilizing Jedis can lead to simpler code when dealing with straightforward, linear execution paths since it's a more direct and less complex API. However, the management of multiple connections (in the case of a cluster) and the manual handling of node failures or topology changes can add to the code maintenance burden. - **Lettuce**: Due to its asynchronous capabilities and thread-safe connections, Lettuce may introduce more complexity in the code, especially if you're not familiar with asynchronous programming models. However, its built-in resilience and automatic management of cluster topology changes can significantly reduce the effort required to maintain the application in the long run. 6. **API Usage**: - **Jedis**: For getting cluster nodes you would use methods like \`jedis.clusterNodes()\` which returns a \`String\` containing details about the nodes, which you'd have to parse as needed. - **Lettuce**: Lettuce has the \`Partitions\` data type representing the current view of the cluster which can be obtained through \`cluster.getPartitions()\`. It provides a more structured approach to handling the information. 7. **Performance Considerations**: - **Jedis**: Because Jedis is synchronous, it is easy to reason about performance in a request/response paradigm. Its simplicity can be an asset for smaller applications where concurrency is limited. However, in high-throughput scenarios, the blocking nature of Jedis can become a bottleneck. - **Lettuce**: Lettuce's non-blocking I/O allows it to scale with the application's concurrency needs. Its asynchronous capabilities can help to achieve higher throughput, especially in applications requiring numerous concurrent connections to Redis. However, that does not necessarily mean that Lettuce is always faster than Jedis; it depends on how you use each client and the specific use case. 8. **Community and Support**: - Both Jedis and Lettuce have strong communities, but you might find that Lettuce, being the more modern solution, is getting more community focus and updating more frequently with more features relevant to contemporary application design. In summary, Lettuce offers more advanced features out of the box that are especially useful for dealing with complex cluster environments, but it's also the more complex of the two options, both in terms of API and operational semantics. Jedis might still be the preferred option for simple use cases or when applications do not require the non-blocking and asynchronous capabilities that Lettuce provides. When working with Redis clusters, it's advisable to familiarize yourself with the specific needs of your application and the potential scalability requirements in the future to make an informed decision between these two clients."},{"instruction":"how jedis and lettuce connect to redis cluster","output":"Jedis and Lettuce both provide mechanisms for connecting to a Redis Cluster, leveraging the clustering functionality built into Redis for scaling out and achieving high availability. However, the way they establish and manage connections within a clustered environment differs due to their underlying design. # Connecting to Redis Cluster with Jedis Jedis uses a straightforward approach to connect to a Redis Cluster. Here is a high-level overview of how Jedis connects to a Redis Cluster: 1. You instantiate a \`JedisCluster\` object by providing a set of \`HostAndPort\` instances which represent the cluster nodes you know about initially. These could just be the entry points into the cluster, not necessarily all the nodes. \`\`\`java Set<HostAndPort> clusterNodes = new HashSet<>(); clusterNodes.add(new HostAndPort(\\"127.0.0.1\\", 7000)); clusterNodes.add(new HostAndPort(\\"127.0.0.1\\", 7001)); // ... add other cluster nodes as required JedisCluster jedisCluster = new JedisCluster(clusterNodes); \`\`\` 2. Internally, the \`JedisCluster\` instance discovers other nodes in the cluster by using the \`CLUSTER NODES\` or \`CLUSTER SLOTS\` commands to any of these initial nodes. 3. When performing operations, \`JedisCluster\` will compute the hash slot for the key and then directly connect to the node which is responsible for that hash slot. 4. Jedis maintains a separate connection to each node in the cluster. These connections are not shared between threads, so you need to handle that, usually by implementing a connection pool for each node if you are running in a multi-threaded environment. 5. If the cluster topology changes (nodes are added or removed), you generally have to handle this manually unless you use an external library that extends Jedis to provide this functionality. # Connecting to Redis Cluster with Lettuce Lettuce operates differently due to its asynchronous, non-blocking IO capabilities. Below is an overview of how Lettuce connects to a Redis Cluster: 1. You create a \`RedisClusterClient\` instance by providing the URIs of some or all known cluster nodes. \`\`\`java RedisURI redisNode1 = RedisURI.create(\\"redis://127.0.0.1:7000\\"); RedisURI redisNode2 = RedisURI.create(\\"redis://127.0.0.1:7001\\"); List<RedisURI> clusterNodes = Arrays.asList(redisNode1, redisNode2); // ... add other cluster nodes as necessary RedisClusterClient clusterClient = RedisClusterClient.create(clusterNodes); \`\`\` 2. Lettuce uses a \`Partitions\` object to maintain the current view of the cluster. It loads this partition information through the \`CLUSTER NODES\` or \`CLUSTER SLOTS\` commands upon first connection and, by default, updates this information periodically in the background. 3. You acquire connections from the client. With Lettuce, you can use a single connection instance concurrently across multiple threads, as it is designed to be thread-safe. You can use the synchronous, asynchronous, or even reactive API models depending on your needs. \`\`\`java StatefulRedisClusterConnection<String, String> connection = clusterClient.connect(); \`\`\` 4. When you issue a command, Lettuce determines the appropriate node to handle the request based on the hash slot and sends the command to that node. This is done in a non-blocking fashion. 5. Lettuce’s connections are resilient and can automatically reconnect if a node goes down. Furthermore, it supports transparent command routing to the new master during failover events. 6. If the cluster topology changes, Lettuce can automatically update its internal representation of the cluster without requiring manual intervention, thanks to its cluster topology refresh feature. Both Jedis and Lettuce provide client-side partitioning, which hides the complexity of dealing with a distributed system. They both support executing commands against the right node according to the key's hash slot. The primary distinctions lie in their connection management, synchronization, and the way they handle changes in the cluster topology. Lettuce's more advanced features such as auto-reconnect and automatic topology refresh make it better suited for applications that require higher levels of abstraction and fault tolerance when connecting to a Redis Cluster."},{"instruction":"how to choose jedis and lettuce","output":"Choosing between Jedis and Lettuce largely depends on the requirements of your application, your familiarity with asynchronous programming, and the level of complexity you're willing to manage. Here are some factors to consider when making the decision: 1. **Synchronization Model**: - If you need synchronous, blocking I/O and your application is relatively simple or single-threaded, Jedis can be a good choice. - If you're building a highly concurrent, multi-threaded, or non-blocking reactive application, Lettuce would be more suitable due to its support for asynchronous and reactive programming paradigms. 2. **Thread Safety**: - Jedis is not thread-safe, which means you need to manage connection pooling or ensure that connections are not shared between threads. - Lettuce connections are designed to be thread-safe, allowing you to share a single connection instance across multiple threads. 3. **Cluster Support and Client Maturity**: - Both libraries provide support for Redis clusters, but Lettuce might have an edge due to automatic topology updates, better connection management, and more robust failover behavior. - Evaluate whether the maturity of the clients aligns with your production use cases, noting that while both libraries are well-established, Lettuce's feature set is generally more modern and might continue to see more active development. 4. **Performance**: - Understand your application's load profile. Jedis may be more suitable for lightweight transactions and simple workloads. - Lettuce, with its non-blocking I/O, usually provides better performance for high-throughput and high-concurrency scenarios. 5. **Maintenance and Operational Considerations**: - Jedis might be easier to operate and maintain due to its simplicity, but it may require manual intervention for some cluster management tasks. - Lettuce provides more complex features out of the box, such as auto-reconnect and topology refresh, potentially reducing operational overhead. 6. **Community and Support**: - Look into the communities supporting Jedis and Lettuce (e.g., GitHub, Stack Overflow). A more active community can be a practical advantage in terms of getting support and finding resources. 7. **Compatibility with Frameworks**: - Check if the library is recommended or better supported by the frameworks you are using. For example, Spring Data Redis provides integration with both Jedis and Lettuce, but Lettuce is the preferred client for reactive programming support. 8. **Future-Proofing**: - Consider the direction of your project and whether one client may better accommodate future requirements, such as the need to scale, add more complex transaction handling, or use reactive streams. 9. **Learning Curve**: - If you are not familiar with asynchronous programming, there will be a learning curve with Lettuce. Make sure you have the resources and time to invest in this learning. 10. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**: - Applications that demand a high level of fault tolerance, such as those that can't afford to manually react to topology changes in a Redis cluster, will benefit from Lettuce's built-in mechanisms. 11. **Transaction Support**: - Consider which library better supports the transactional constructs you need. Both Jedis and Lettuce support transactions and Lua scripting, but their APIs and ways to use transactions may differ. Ultimately, both Jedis and Lettuce are capable Redis clients, and your choice should be informed by practical factors such as the ones mentioned above. It can be helpful to prototype small parts of your system with both clients to see which aligns best with your application's architecture and your team's skills."},{"instruction":"When you connect to a Redis cluster using Jedis, what would happen if you dont pull down the redis cluster nodes","output":"If you don't pull down the cluster nodes information in a Redis cluster when using Jedis, your client may not be aware of the entire cluster topology, which includes details about all master and slave nodes and which slots they are responsible for. This topology information is vital for the client to route commands to the correct cluster node that holds the data. Here's what can happen if you don't retrieve or update the cluster nodes information: 1. **Incomplete Topology Information**: - Without polling the cluster nodes, your Jedis client starts with whichever nodes you provided during initialization. Typically, this would be a subset of cluster nodes that you expect to be stable and reachable. If the client does not know about all the nodes in the cluster, it may not operate efficiently or correctly. 2. **Routing Issues**: - Redis Cluster partitions the data across master nodes according to hash slots. Jedis needs to know which node holds which slot. If it's missing this information, it may not correctly calculate the hash slot for a given key and may attempt to access it on the wrong node. 3. **Error Responses**: - When Jedis attempts to operate on a key that is not handled by the node it's connected to, Redis responds with a \`MOVED\` or \`ASK\` error, indicating the correct node to which Jedis should redirect the request. Without the cluster nodes information, Jedis would rely solely on these error responses to dynamically discover and redirect to the appropriate node. This reliance can cause additional latency due to the initial failed attempt and subsequent redirection. 4. **Inability to Handle Failovers**: - In a Redis cluster, nodes can fail and be replaced by replicas. Clients are expected to discover these changes. Without regularly updating the cluster nodes information, Jedis will not detect these changes, potentially causing requests to be directed to failed nodes or otherwise incorrect targets. 5. **Reduced Fault Tolerance**: - Automatic detection of node failures and re-routing of commands to replicas or promoted masters is an essential feature of a cluster-aware client. Without current cluster information, Jedis lacks the ability to do this. Your application will have to deal with more exceptions and manual intervention in the event of node failures. In practice, when using \`JedisCluster\`, it has minimal internal handling for the cluster topology. It discovers nodes upon initial connection (or when it encounters a \`MOVED\` or \`ASK\` error). If you never pull down the full cluster nodes information manually, \`JedisCluster\` will continue to operate based on the initial contacts and any subsequent updates it receives through error responses from Redis. However, this can mean that \`JedisCluster\` may not be operating with an optimal view of the cluster, which can lead to inefficiencies and a greater likelihood of encountering errors. In typical application scenarios, you won't explicitly pull down the cluster information when using \`JedisCluster\`, as it's already being managed internally to some degree. To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, you should design your application to handle potential errors and redirections as the Redis cluster changes over time."},{"instruction":"When you connect to a Redis cluster using Lettuce, what would happen if you dont pull down the redis cluster nodes","output":"When using Lettuce to connect to a Redis cluster, the client library is designed to automatically discover and manage cluster topology. It uses the information retrieved from the \`CLUSTER NODES\` or \`CLUSTER SLOTS\` command to understand the current state of the cluster, which includes which nodes exist and how the slots are distributed among them. This topology information is used to dispatch commands to the appropriate cluster node that holds the data for a given key. If you don't explicitly pull down the Redis cluster nodes information when using Lettuce, here's what generally will happen: 1. **Automatic Discovery**: When you create a \`RedisClusterClient\` and establish a connection, Lettuce automatically performs an initial topology view retrieval using the nodes you've provided upon initialization. 2. **Dynamic Update**: Lettuce has the ability to refresh the cluster topology regularly, either on a schedule or when it encounters a redirection error such as \`MOVED\` or \`ASK\`. This helps ensure the client maintains an up-to-date view of the cluster without your intervention. 3. **Transparent Handling**: If a command is sent to a node that is not responsible for the respective key, Lettuce handles redirection errors (\`MOVED\`, \`ASK\`) by updating its internal view of the cluster topology and retrying the command with the correct node. 4. **Adaptation to Failovers**: Lettuce detects failovers and adapts by refreshing its topology view, determining the new masters for slots previously managed by failed masters, and continuing operations with minimal disruption. 5. **Configurability**: Lettuce allows you to configure the cluster topology refresh options. You can choose whether the client should refresh the topology view upon encountering certain errors, and with periodical updates. If you intentionally disable topology refreshes (both periodic and adaptive), or if you rely entirely on static configuration without any refreshing, the following situations may arise: - **Stale Topology Information**: The client could maintain an outdated view of the cluster if topology changes occur, such as new nodes being added, nodes failing, or slot migrations happening. - **Routing Inefficiencies**: Without up-to-date topology information, Lettuce may route commands based on stale information, which can lead to unnecessary \`MOVED\` or \`ASK\` redirections, impacting performance. - **Reduced Resilience**: Handling failovers becomes less efficient without topology updates because the client will not be aware of role changes (e.g., a slave being promoted to master) until it encounters a redirection error. - **Manual Management Needed**: To ensure that Lettuce is aware of the current cluster state, you might have to manage topology updates manually in the application logic, which is not ideal and defeats the purpose of using a sophisticated client like Lettuce. In summary, one of Lettuce’s main advantages is its ability to manage cluster topology transparently and efficiently. It is rare to intentionally avoid pulling down the cluster nodes information when using Lettuce, as the default behavior is designed to handle this automatically and robustly. It is typically in your best interest to take advantage of Lettuce's auto-refresh mechanisms to maintain high performance and robust fault tolerance in your Redis cluster operations."},{"instruction":"what is the difference between the node information and the topology of redis cluster","output":"In the context of Redis Cluster, \\"node information\\" and \\"topology\\" refer to related but distinct concepts that describe the overall structure and status of the cluster. Here's how they differ: # Node Information Node information refers to the details about individual nodes that are part of the Redis Cluster. This includes: - **Node ID**: The unique identifier for each Redis node within the cluster. - **IP Address/Hostname**: The address on which the node is reachable. - **Port Number**: The port on which the Redis node service is running. - **Role**: Whether the node is a master or a replica (slave). - **Master ID**: For replica nodes, this indicates the ID of the master node it is associated with. - **Slots Coverage**: For master nodes, this indicates the hash slots that the node is responsible for serving. - **Link State**: The connection status of the node, such as whether the node is currently connected or disconnected. - **Additional Flags**: Various states the node could be in, such as \`myself\` (the node from which the response was received), \`fail?\` (suspected fail), \`fail\` (confirmed fail), etc. This node-specific information can usually be retrieved in Redis using the \`CLUSTER NODES\` command and is critical for the clients and administrators to understand the specific attributes and status of each node. # Cluster Topology Cluster topology, on the other hand, refers to the structure and layout of the cluster as a whole. It encompasses the arrangement and interaction of all nodes that make up the cluster and includes: - **Cluster Nodes Configuration**: The set of all nodes in the cluster, both masters, and replicas, and their node information as described above. - **Slots Distribution**: Detailed mapping that shows which node (master) holds which particular range of hash slots. Each master is responsible for a subset of the 16,384 hash slots, and this distribution defines the data layout across nodes. - **Master-Replica Relationships**: How replicas are associated with master nodes for data redundancy and failover purposes. - **Inter-node Communication Paths**: The network connections between nodes, which are used for cluster bus communications, including heartbeats, configuration updates, and failover coordination. - **Availability and Failover Procedures**: The mechanism by which the cluster handles failing nodes (e.g., promoting replicas to masters) to ensure data availability and consistency. Cluster topology represents the dynamic, logical, and physical composition of the cluster, and it is critical for ensuring proper operation, data partitioning, high availability, and consistent hashing. It often is visualized as a diagram or a map, showing the connections and relationships between nodes. Redis clients use both the detailed node information and the broader cluster topology to intelligently route commands to the appropriate nodes and handle changes in the cluster such as node failures or slot migrations. Successful Redis Cluster operations require an accurate and up-to-date view of both individual node information and overall topology."},{"instruction":"is the concepts of topology bigger than node infomation","output":"Yes, the concept of topology is broader and more encompassing than individual node information in the context of a Redis cluster, or any distributed system for that matter. **Topology** refers to the complete arrangement and connectivity of the nodes within the system: how they are linked together, how information (like data requests) flows between them, and how they are organized to distribute the workload. Topology includes understanding the roles of nodes, how they replicate data, and how they balance the load to provide a resilient system. It's a high-level view of the entire system's architecture and operations. **Node information**, on the other hand, is the data about a single node within that structure: its role, status, the range of data it is responsible for, and other operational specifics. It is a more granular view, focused on the properties and state of an individual element within the topology. The topology includes node information as one of its components, but while you can understand node information in isolation, understanding the topology requires looking at how each node and its information fits into the larger picture. In essence, topology gives you the \\"map\\" of the system, while node information gives the \\"details\\" about each location on the map."},{"instruction":"how to build redis cluster using docker on windows","output":"Building a Redis cluster using Docker on Windows involves creating multiple Redis instances that communicate with each other in the cluster configuration. Docker provides a platform-independent way to run Redis instances in isolated containers. Here's a basic guide on how you can set up a Redis cluster using Docker on Windows: # Prerequisites - **Docker**: Ensure Docker Desktop for Windows is installed and running. Enable it to use Linux containers because Redis doesn’t have official support for Windows containers. # Step 1: Create a Docker Network First, create a custom bridge network that will allow containers to communicate with each other: \`\`\`bash docker network create --driver bridge redis-cluster-net \`\`\` # Step 2: Run Redis Instances Run six Redis instances for a minimal cluster setup (with three master and three replica nodes). As of Docker's networking features, it is not necessary to expose the Redis ports to the host, so they can communicate using the internal Docker network: \`\`\`bash for i in \`seq 1 6\`; do docker run -d --name redis-i --net redis-cluster-net redis:latest redis-server --appendonly yes --cluster-enabled yes --cluster-config-file nodes.conf --cluster-node-timeout 5000 --bind 0.0.0.0 done \`\`\` Here, \`--appendonly yes\` is enabling persistence, \`--cluster-enabled yes\` is to enable cluster mode, and \`--cluster-config-file nodes.conf\` specifies the file that stores the cluster configuration. # Step 3: Create the Cluster Once all the instances are running, use \`redis-cli\` to create a cluster from those instances. Since you're dealing with a Docker environment, you'll execute the \`redis-cli\` command inside one of the running Redis containers, and use Docker's own form of service discovery: \`\`\`bash docker exec -it redis-1 redis-cli --cluster create (docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' redis-1):6379 (docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' redis-2):6379 (docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' redis-3):6379 (docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' redis-4):6379 (docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' redis-5):6379 (docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' redis-6):6379 --cluster-replicas 1 \`\`\` This command discovers the IP addresses of all six containers and tells \`redis-cli\` to create a cluster with them, configuring one replica for each master. # Step 4: Confirm the Cluster is Running To confirm that your cluster is set up and running, use the following command on one of the nodes: \`\`\`bash docker exec -it redis-1 redis-cli --cluster check (docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' redis-1):6379 \`\`\` This command executes the \`redis-cli --cluster check\` command against the first Redis instance to verify the health and configuration of your cluster. # Notes - You might need to adjust firewall settings on Windows to allow communication between cluster nodes. - When the \`redis-cli\` command asks you to confirm the creation of the cluster, type \`yes\` to proceed. This setup gives you a simple Redis cluster to experiment with or use for development purposes. For production use or more advanced development, you'd want to look into configuring aspects like data persistence, security, better networking solutions, resource limits, and possibly using Docker Compose or even Kubernetes to orchestrate your containers."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Aim for more readability like Ernest Hemingway. The Given Essay: While we sleep, several thousands of children will be working through the night to produce the clothes that we buy. This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences?

In Philadelphia, she spoke to the hearts of those present, rallying them against the cruelty of child labor. Her speech brims with strategic language—vivid descriptions, repetitive phrasing, and rhetorical questions—to shake her audience awake. Kelley paints a grim picture: as we slumber, countless children slave away in factories, crafting garments we mindlessly buy. Her words, \\"Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms,\\" are designed to pierce the conscience. The repetitive use of \\"children\\" and \\"they\\" hammers home the reality of youthful innocence exploited for profit. Consider how Kelley strings words together in a litany of labors: \\"The children make our shoes... they knit our stockings ... they spin and weave our cotton underwear ...\\" This relentless cadence becomes a chant, reinforcing the argument with each iteration. The words meld together, the images blur, and the message crystallizes—these young souls are burdened beyond their years. Rhetorical questions add further weight to Kelley's plea. \\"Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that shameful repeal bill if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?\\" she asks. The query corners the audience, demanding introspection and igniting a desire for change. Kelley's rhetoric demands action. Her vivid imagery reveals a hidden world of suffering, her repetition serves as a relentless call to awareness, and her rhetorical questions provoke a sense of urgency. With strategic clarity, she bids us not only listen but act—from empathy to empowerment, for the sake of the children languishing in shadows of industry. She argues not simply to lament but to inspire suffragists to partner with labor organizations and liberate these young workers from the clutches of exploitation. Kelley understood her audience and their longing for reform. She harnessed the power of language to shape their views on enfranchisement and child labor, to unite them in a common cause. Through an analysis of her rhetoric, we appreciate the potency of her words—words that, a century later, stir us still, guiding us in confronting injustices with as steadfast and persuasive a voice as hers."},{"instruction":"Rewrite only given essay(don’t write your own) to meet objectives in the rubric, while keeping the original words used by the writer and argument of the writer. Aim for more readability. The Given Essay: While we sleep, several thousands of children will be working through the night to produce the clothes that we buy. This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

By deploying a powerful array of rhetorical strategies, including evocative descriptions, strategic repetitions, and probing rhetorical questions, Kelley not only communicates the urgency of her cause but also skillfully persuades her listeners to join her in the fight against the exploitation of children for labor. Kelley's vivid depiction of children's work environments is more than mere description; it is a calculated emotional appeal. Her account of \\"little girls... working in textile mills, all the night through, in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms\\" does more than create an image; it invokes a visceral reaction. The audience is compelled to empathize with the children's plight, feeling a mix of sorrow and indignation. This is not simply a narrative technique; it's a strategic use of pathos that bolsters Kelley's argument and pushes the audience toward action. The repetitive use of \\"children\\" and \\"they\\" throughout the speech is not mere redundancy. Each recurrence serves to reinforce the focus on the young victims of this crisis, ensuring that the audience keeps the image of the children at the forefront of their minds. Kelley's repetition, particularly effective in spoken rhetoric, cements the issue in the listener's consciousness—a move not only to inform but to spur the audience into taking a stand on the issue of child labor. Moreover, Kelley's application of rhetorical questions does more than punctuate her points; it turns her speech into an interactive experience for the audience. By asking, \\"would the Georgia Legislature have refused... to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age?\\" Kelley invites the listeners to consider their own values and the power of their potential influence. These questions are not queries awaiting a response; they are strategic tools designed to engage the audience's sense of justice and to motivate them to act on behalf of disenfranchised children. In Kelley's speech, the sophisticated interplay of rhetorical devices serves a dual function: to depict the stark reality of child labor and to inspire her audience to advocate for change. Each device—the evocative descriptions, the clever repetitions, and the compelling questions—work in tandem to fortify her argument. Kelley's mastery of these strategies illuminates not just a singular point but a cohesive, persuasive message urging the empowerment of women and thereby the liberation of child laborers. Kelley's rhetoric is thus emblematic of her broader purpose: to galvanize support for enfranchisement and, consequently, for legislative reform to protect the most vulnerable. Her strategic employment of these devices demonstrates a deep understanding of her audience and the exigencies of her time. In doing so, Kelley's speech exemplifies how rhetorical finesse can elevate a call for justice into a resonant and transformative appeal that resonates through time."},{"instruction":"create an event log where the researcher reads her autobiography in their office: Event Log: Date: [REDACTED] Location: SCP-079 Containment Chamber [Researcher and Technician enter the containment chamber, carrying the refined tablet.] Researcher: Good day, Cassy!

The Given Essay: While we sleep, several thousands of children will be working through the night to produce the clothes that we buy. This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

This stark reality forms the heart of Florence Kelley's speech. Kelley, an American social worker and reformer, advocated fiercely for child labor laws and enhanced working conditions for women. She presented her speech at the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Kelley draws on rhetorical techniques like vivid imagery, strategic repetition, and rhetorical questions to persuade her audience to oppose child labor. This essay will explore the effectiveness of these strategies. Kelley paints a vivid picture of the harsh realities of child labor in factories, a tactic that not only brings the suffering of these children to life for her audience but also bolsters her argument. She describes how \\"Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving...for us to buy\\". This information is designed to stir emotions and make the audience contemplate the harsh lives of these children, inspiring them to take action against child labor. Kelley's speech thrives on the strategic repetition of \\"children\\" and \\"they,\\" as well as the use of similar sentence constructions. As her audience listened to her words, this repetition ensured the message was not only heard but ingrained in their minds. One stark example reads: \\"The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings...they spin and weave silk and velvet...they carry bundles of garments...little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us.\\" By repeating these structures, Kelley reinforces her argument with significant impact. Rhetorical questions in Kelley's speech add drama and shape listeners' views on child labor. For instance, she asks, \\"If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused...to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age?\\" Such questions shine a light on injustices and call for change by compelling listeners to consider the issues more deeply. In summary, Florence Kelley's speech at the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention skillfully used rhetorical strategies such as detailed imagery, deliberate repetition, and probing questions to not just inform her audience, but inspire them to join her in the fight against child labor."},{"instruction":"Rewrite only given essay(don’t write your own) to meet objectives in the rubric, while keeping the original words used by the writer and argument of the writer.

In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

She once gave a poignant speech about the harsh realities of child labor. It was during a meeting in Philadelphia for the National American Woman Suffrage Association on July 22, 1905. Kelley painted a vivid picture of children toiling through the night to make the very clothes we wear. She used descriptive language, repetition, and rhetorical questions to persuade her audience to join her in the fight against child labor. Kelley's descriptions were so clear and powerful that they brought the terrible conditions right before the audience's eyes. She talked about little girls working non-stop in noisy textile mills, weaving fancy fabrics while the rest of us sleep peacefully in our beds. These images struck a chord with people, making them feel a deep sense of pity and urging them to stand against such child labor practices. She also repeated words like \\"children\\" and \\"they\\" throughout her speech. This wasn't just to make a point. Since her speech was meant to be heard, not read, repeating these words made sure that the message got through to her listeners loud and clear. Like a drumbeat, these words echoed in the room, driving home the severity of the situation with every repetition. Kelley also posed powerful questions that made her audience think hard about the issues. She wondered aloud if the laws would be different if the mothers in Georgia and New Jersey had the right to vote. These questions were not just for show—they were a clever way to get people to realize the injustice of it all and consider the need for change. Through her speech, Kelley used these methods masterfully to not just inform, but to persuade her audience to join her noble cause. Her choices in language, structure, and strategy worked together to make a compelling argument that would move people to action. By analyzing Kelley's speech, we can see how she effectively made her case against child labor. Her strategic use of language and style showed the urgency of the problem and influenced people's views on this pressing social issue."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

그녀와의 연결점이 끊어지지 않고 계속해서 유지가 됐다면? 그것이 발전하여 키요시와 토카가 성장했다면? 상황은 전혀 달랐을 것이다. 그런 사사로운 것들이 사람들을 살아가게 한다. 인간들의 삶에 기폭제는 의외로 작다. 대부분의 사람들은 고작 손톱만 한 기대나 희망을 잡고 숨을 쉰다. 키요시에겐 그것이 토카였을지 모른다. 하지만 사라졌다. 완벽한 타인이며 낯선 이가 된 것이다. 아니 어쩌면 그보다 더 검게 변했을 것이다. 그런데 그 복수가, 숙제가 아무 의미가 없는가? 그를 누가 손가락질하며 욕할 수 있는가. 어쩌면 키요시는 살고 싶었는지 모른다. 삶의 의미를 ‘숙제’로 자각하고 행동했을 것이다. 당했는데 어찌 아무것도 안 하며 살아가겠는가? 그는 타당한 판단을 내렸다. 이기적이라 말해도, 방법이 틀렸다 말해도 상관없다. 피해자? 가해자? 그런 게 무슨 의미가 있나. 그저 현실이다. 일이 벌어졌다. 현상이 일어났다. 이미 키요시의 삶은 어긋났다. 살기 위해선 어떻게든 원점으로 돌아가야 했다. 발악하는 수준은 아니지만 차분히 해야 할 숙제를 할 뿐이다. 목적, 목표, 꿈. 또 다른 말론 희망. 키요시에겐 그것이 복수일 테지. 어디선가 지켜봐 줘. 언젠가 검사를 맡을 거야. 그런 뒤 모든 것을 끝낸 이요타 키요시는 일상 속에 숨어들었다. ‘낯선 이’로서 응시한다. 그가 보는 것이 카메라인지, 관객들인지, 미사키 토카인지, 아니면 자신의 삶인지는 확실치 않다. 하나 확실한 건 원점이라는 것이다. ‘낯기생’의 원작을 쓴, 세계적으로 저명한 타키카와 아카리 작가는 놀라웠다. 당연히 쿄타로 감독이 수정 요청으로 들고 온 결말 때문이었다. 코끝에 안경을 걸친 아카리 작가가 손에 쥔 종이를 내렸다. 그리곤. ‘우진씨가 이런 결말을- 제의했다?’ 한국의 배우 강우진을 떠올렸다. 그녀가 이렇게나 놀라는 이유는 간단했다. 과거의 자신도 생각해봤던 결말이었으니까. 아니, 명확하게는 이 결말이 진짜였다. ‘디테일은 조금 다르지만 끝은 비슷해.’ 출판 전 ‘낯기생’의 초고 결말은 키요시가 보통의 사람들과 섞여 사는 것이었다. 물론, 세세한 장면이나 연출은 쿄타로 감독이 가져온 것과는 판이하지만 뜻은 같다. 하지만 당시의 아카리 작가는 정해놨던 결말을 꺾었다. 이해관계가 너무 많았으니까. 거기다 그녀의 전세계 팬들도 문제였다. 과거의 시대적 분위기도 한몫 거들었다. 뭐가 됐든 원래의 결말은 아카리 작가의 가슴속에 묻어야 했다. 이후 퍽 오랜 시간이 지난 뒤, 별안간 타국의 배우가 묻어뒀던 결말을 끄집어냈다. ‘대체 이런 생각은 왜 했던 걸까?’ 지금껏 많은 작품이 영화나 드라마로 만들어진 아카리 작가였다. 허나 지금껏 단 한 번도, 그 어떤 배우도 아카리 작가에게 정정을 제의하지 않았다. 강우진이 처음이다. 아카리 작가의 눈이 천천히 건너편 쿄타로 감독에게 닿았다. “이 연출이나 세세한 설정도 우진씨가 제의한 건가요?” 쿄타로 감독이 작게 고개를 저었다. “아닙니다. 장면, 장소, 연출 등 세세한 설정은 제가 얹었습니다. 하지만 핵심 아이디어는 우진씨가 한 거죠.” “어떤 식으로.” “인과응보를 부정하는 것.” 새치 가득한 쿄타로 감독은 우진에게 들었던 말들을 덤덤하게 읊었다. “키요시에겐 인과응보는 안 어울리며, 아무 피해 없이 잘 먹고 잘사는 게 색깔이 맞다는 군요.” “······잘 먹고 잘 사는 것.” “예. 이요타 키요시가 망가지는 것 같다는 말도.” “후-” 금세 아카리 작가의 얼굴에 미소가 번졌다. “우진씨는 키요시를 진심으로 마주 보고 있었나 봐요.” “그렇죠, 아니고서야 나올 수 없는 결론이니까.” “참 묘한 배우네. 아닌 척하면서 다 보고 있고 모르는 척하면서 다 알고 있어. 속이 까발려진 기분이네요.” “속이 까발려진다?” 되물음에 숨을 옅게 내쉰 아카리 작가가 ‘낯기생’의 과거를 설명했다. 최초의 결말이 존재했다는 것. 그것을 뭉갰다는 것. 그리고 현재까지. “지금 와서 생각해보면 아마 겁이 났던 거 같아요. 그래서 키요시를 현실에 맞췄어요. 그것이 도망가는 것임을 알고 있음에도.” “······이해합니다. 저 역시 과거엔 그랬으니. 아니, 지금까지도. 아마 그 결과가 지금 일본의 컨텐츠 시장을 만들었다 생각합니다. 다들 너무 겁이 많은 거지.” 두 거물이 약간 씁쓸한 웃음을 지었다. 그중 먼저 입을 연 것은 아카리 작가였다. “이 나이에 와서도 배울 게 참 많네요. 설마 한국의 배우에게 배움을 느낄 줄은 몰랐어요. 비정한 냉철함보다는 그 겁 없는 기세가 부럽네요.” “강우진씨는 처음부터 그랬죠. 세상과 타협 보지 않는 괴물. 그건 재능의 영역이라 따라 할 수도 없죠.” 순간, 진중한 얼굴로 변한 아카리 작가가 주제를 바꿨다. “이 결말로 가신다면- 지금껏 응집된 일본의 컨텐츠 시장을 정면으로 반박하는 거예요. 깨부수겠다는 선전포고고.” “압니다.” “아마 재난이 터지겠죠. 대중의 극심한 반발, 원작 강성 팬들의 엄청난 원성, 업계의 격렬한 반항. 결코 환대받진 못 할거예요.” “거대한 논란이나 대차게 욕먹는 것 역시 있겠죠. 그럼에도 전 이 결말이 아니라면 평생 후회할 거 같습니다.” 아카리 작가와 눈을 맞춘 쿄타로 감독이 점잖은 미소를 지었다. “무언가를 바꾸고자 한다면 누군가는 출혈이 나는 건 당연합니다. 아, 물론 작가님의 허락이 가장 중요합니다.” “······일본 전체를 뒤흔들 전쟁의 서막. 욕으로 펑펑 터지는 장면, 나만 기대되는 거예요? 전 재밌을 것 같은데. 개봉한 뒤 잔잔한 것보다는 비바람에 해일이 들이치는 게 더 낫죠. 뭣보다 과거에 내가 못 한 걸 보고 싶기도 해요.” 엄지를 세운 아카리 작가가 웃음 섞인 답변을 내놨다. “전 콜.” “감사합니다, 작가님.” “근데 감독님 혼자 총대 메는 그림인데 괜찮나요? 언론 발표에서 제 얘기를 하셔도 돼요.” “아니요. 원작 작가님께 피해를 드릴 순 없죠. 그리고 저 말고도 우진씨도 나눠 가지게 될 겁니다. 배역을 연기한 배우시니까. 그래서 그에게 미리 말해 뒀습니다.” “···우진씨는 뭐라고 답했나요?” “‘딱히 상관없습니다.’라고.” “그 다운 대답이네요.” 풉하고 실소가 터진 아카리 작가가 강우진의 덤덤한 얼굴을 상기했다. “언젠가 내 작품 속 주인공으로 써봐야겠어요.” 몇 시간 뒤, 늦은 점심쯤. 강우진은 ‘낯기생’의 세트장에서 찾을 수 있었다. 바삐 움직이는 백여 명 스탭들. 콘티를 보는 등의 저마다 할 일을 하는 일본 배우들. 오늘 ‘낯기생’의 소집은 조금 늦었다. 쿄타로 감독의 일정 때문이었다. 그래도 의자에 앉은 우진의 의상과 메이크업은 키요시로 변해있었다. 역시나 근엄하다. 허나 알맹이는 딴생각 중. ‘후- 갑자기 칼칼한 된장찌개 땡기네. 딴 나라 오면 이게 문제야, 쯧. 안 되겠다 오늘 한식집 가자고 얘기해야지.’ 물론, 겉보기엔 시니컬하게 콘티를 보고 있는 것으로 비친다. 그때였다. “우진씨!!” 세트장 사이, 모니터나 키스탭들이 모인 곳에서 조감독이 강우진을 콜했다. 스탠바인가? 했는데 아니었다. “잠시 괜찮으십니까??!” 강우진이 최성건과 시선을 교환한 뒤 의자서 일어나 덤덤히 걸었다. 우진이 가까이 다가오자 조감독이나 키스탭 등은 자리에서 빠졌다. 남은 것은 촬영 콘티를 손에 쥔 쿄타로 감독, 그리고 형사 ‘요시자와 모치오’ 역을 맡은 마나 코사쿠였다. 셋이 모인 상황에 쿄타로 감독이 입을 열었다. “‘낯기생’의 결말이 바뀝니다.” 곧, 얼굴 선이 짙은 마나 코사쿠의 눈이 약간 커졌다. 반대로 강우진은 포커페이스를 유지했다. 컨셉질보단 이미 예상했으니까. ‘오- 대박, 먹혔다는 건가??’ 애초 강우진이 제안한 건이니 당연했다. 이어 진중해진 코사쿠가 되물었다. “결말이 바뀐다? 그렇다는 건 기존 시나리오에서 어느 정도를 걷어낸다는 말씀인지.” “‘이요타 키요시’의 마지막 부분은 모두 들어내고 새로 갑니다. 하지만 이미 찍은 분량은 건들 필요는 없고, 다른 배우들의 씬도 크게 바뀌지 않을 겁니다.” ‘낯기생’에서 후반부와 결말 쪽을 책임지는 건 키요시와 형사 모치오기에 당연했다. 다른 인물들은 그 전에 모두 제거된다. “코사쿠씨의 씬들도 크게 변동은 없을 겁니다. 하지만 감정이나 생각 등은 달라질 거예요. 물론, 기존과 아예 180도 뒤집히는 건 키요시가 되겠고.” ‘낯기생’의 극 후반부와 결말을 이끄는 건 역시 강우진이었다. 연출이나 장면 자체가 달라진다. 반면, 형사 역을 맡을 코사쿠는 대부분의 씬이 유지된다. 그래도 변하는 감정선은 알아둬야 했다. “이미 다른 배우들에겐 알렸어요. 촬영 팀은 변경된 결말에 따라 움직이고 있고, 작가님도 오케이했습니다. 두 분에게 수정된 콘티는 오늘 안에 전달하겠습니다. 그래도 일단은- 사전 쪽대본으로 내용을 읽어는 두세요.” 쿄타로 감독이 준비해둔 종이들을 강우진과 코사쿠에게 전했다. 동시에 두 배우가 선 자리서 쪽대본을 읽었다. 바뀐 ‘낯기생’의 결말 포함, 앞뒤로 감정선이나 연출이 튀지 않게 이어지는 씬도 실렸다. 단단한 얼굴인 우진은 속으로 순수하게 감탄했다. ‘워- 뭐냐 이거. 좀 간지터지네?? 그렇지, 키요시가 이래야 좀 임팩트있지.’ 컷이 마음에 든 그였다. 추가로 쿄타로 감독의 능력에 박수쳤다. 강우진이 아이디어를 툭 던진 게 며칠 전이다. 그런데 쿄타로 감독은 그 짧은 기간 안에 기깔나는 결말을 가지고 왔다. 과연 거장이라 이건가? 일 진행 속도도 시나리오 작업 수준도 탑티어가 확실했다. 이쯤. “······” 코사쿠의 얼굴엔 약간의 당황이 서렸다. 내용 수정이야 딴 작품 촬영 중에도 빈번한 편이다. 어쨌거나 배우는 그 변화에 따라야 한다. 최종 결정자는 감독이니까. 그래도 이렇게 결말이 180도 달라지는 건 코사쿠로선 처음이었다. 심지어. ‘지, 진짜로 이 결말로 가려는 건가? 진심이야? 이 정도면 욕을 먹는 정도론 안 끝나.’ 바뀐 ‘낯기생’의 결말이 다소 충격적이었다. 개척자 그 이상이었다. ‘낯기생’의 바뀐 결말은 일본 컨텐츠 시장의 역사를 밟으려 하고 있다. 연예계서 퍽 오래 굴러온 코사쿠는 심정을 솔직하게 뱉었다. “···감독님. 이 결말로 가시는 게 확실하신 겁니까?” “확실해요.” “이, 이대로 가면······원작 강성 팬들이 들고일어날지도 모릅니다.” “그 정도로 끝나면 소소하게 정리된 편이지.” “예?” 논란 또는 반발로 핵폭탄이 펑펑 터지는 미래를 상기하던 쿄타로 감독이 작게 웃었다. 확고함이 서린 표정이었다. “그럼에도 ‘낯기생’의 결말은 한 치의 물러섬 없이 그걸로 확정입니다.” 뒤로. 촬영 시작 전, 마나 코사쿠가 강우진에게 말을 걸었다. 살짝 조심스럽다. “우진씨, 정말 괜찮은 겁니까? 공격의 화살은 아마 배우 중 우진씨에게 가장 많이 쏠릴 겁니다.” 코사쿠는 보통의 탑배우였다. 우진의 추락할 이미지가 선명하기에 극심한 근심을 예측한 것. 그런 경험도 숱하게 많다. 그러거나 말거나 강우진의 낮은 톤의 대답은 단출했다. “사소합니다.” 아니었다. 작은 일은 아니겠지. 그러나 강우진에겐 하등 상관이 없었다. ‘쌩까면 되잖아?’ 알맹이가 소시민인 우진은 일반적인 배우와 결이, 마인드가 달랐다. 죄지은 것도 아니고 뭔 상관? 무시가 답. 이것을 코사쿠는 다르게 해석했다. 강우진의 분위기가 너무도 강직했기에. ‘쿨하군. 허세나 쎈척이 아니야. 무시 없이 겸허히 받아들이지만 연연하진 않아.’ 비정하나 망나니가 아닌 근본이 있는 거만함이다. 마나 코사쿠는 진심으로 배워야 한다 생각했다. ‘2년 차면서도 탑의 자질은 이미 완성됐어, 거물의 태도다.’ 강우진은 딴생각 중이었다. ‘심하면 한국으로 튀면 되잖아? 아- 그쯤이면 한국에 걍 있을라나?’ 코사쿠가 차분히 물었다. “······사소한 겁니까?” 얼굴에 철판을 깐 우진이 목소리를 더 깔았다. “예, 매우.” “대단하네요, 여러모로.” 갑자기 뭔 대단? 미약한 착각의 냄새가 풍겼지만 우진은 되묻지 않았다. 익숙한 향이었으니. 그렇게 정신없는 토요일이 저물고 23일 일요일이 밝았다. 이른 아침부터 세트장에 모인 ‘낯기생’팀. 그중 모자를 푹 눌러쓴 쿄타로 감독이 배급사 쪽에 물었다. “일본과 한국의 개봉 텀은 결정했습니까?” “일본에서 먼저 개봉 후, 한국 개봉은 2주에서 한 달 사이로 조율하고 있습니다. 확정되면 바로 알려드리겠습니다.” “음.” 쿄타로 감독이 이번엔 제작팀에 물었다. “결말을 바꿨을 때, 촬영 일정이 얼마나 밀릴 거 같나.” “어제 정리해봤는데 생각보다 큰 차이는 안 납니다. 보출들 섭외나 장소 협조 등으로 이틀 정도.” “나쁘지 않군.” “다만, 기존 촬영 컷에서 미리 섭외된 부분은 어쩔 수 없이 지출이 생깁니다.” “괜찮아. 투자자 쪽엔 내가 직접 얘기했으니까.” 메인 투자자. 즉, 히데키 회장을 말하는 것. “이틀 딜레이.” 짧게 읊조린 쿄타로 감독이 정리했다. “그럼 크랭크업은 28일 금요일로 확정이군.” 오늘이 23일, ‘낯기생’의 촬영 끝이 약 5일밖에 안 남았다는 소리였다. 이어 몇십 분 후. 도쿄 쪽 도로를 달리는 검은색 고급 세단의 안. 카시히 그룹 총수인, 눈썹에도 흰 털이 섞인 요시무라 히데키 회장의 차였다. 뒷좌석에 앉은 히데키 회장이 누군가와 통화를 하다 핸드폰을 내렸다. 상대는 ‘낯기생’ 현장에 있을 쿄타로 감독이었고. “이봐.” 쿄타로 감독에게서 소식을 접한 히데키 회장이 앞쪽 조수석에 앉은 비서실장 리리를 불렀다. 그러자 반듯한 자세의 리리가 몸을 뒤로 돌렸다. “예, 회장님.” 그런 그녀에게 히데키 회장이 지시했다. “28일 일정들, ‘낯기생’ 현장 방문 뒤로 미뤄. 마지막은 눈에 담아야지.” 지시를 마친 히데키 회장이 창밖을 보며 작게 웃었다. “강우진- ‘낯기생’의 마지막 장식을 어찌할지 궁금하군.” 한편. 방금 호텔 룸의 침대에서 눈을 번쩍 뜬 강우진은. “아- 개피곤.” 몽롱한 정신에 주변 탁자에 쌓인 대본이나 시나리오 중 아무거나 집었다. 중첩된 피곤에 조금 더 쉬기 위함이었다. -푹! 끝없이 캄캄한 아공간에 들어선 강우진. 그가 하품을 쩍- 하며 기지개를 쭉 켰다. 그대로 누우면 됐다. 그 순간. “아.” 습관적으로 흰 사각형들을 보던 우진이 멈칫했다. 흰 사각형 중 하나, ‘낯기생’에 변화가 보였으니까. -[7/시나리오(제목: 낯선 이의 기괴한 희생), SSS급] 떨어지긴커녕 등급이 오히려 올랐다. < 역대 (2) > 끝","output":"< Chronicles (2) > From the beginning, 'Iyota Kiyoshi' was a stranger and an unfamiliar person to others. This remained true from his high school days until the moment he finished his homework and returned to his daily life. He never maintained a relationship with anyone and was disconnected from everyone. But what if Misaki Toka had been alive? What if the connection with her had not been severed and had continued? If that had developed and Kiyoshi and Toka had grown together? The situation would have been completely different. Such personal things keep people alive. The catalysts in people's lives are surprisingly small. Most people breathe clinging to a tiny bit of expectation or hope the size of a fingernail. For Kiyoshi, that might have been Toka. But she disappeared. He became a perfect stranger, an unfamiliar person. Or perhaps he turned even darker than that. But does that revenge, that homework, have no meaning at all? Who can point fingers at him and curse him? Maybe Kiyoshi wanted to live. He would have acted with the awareness that the meaning of life was 'homework.' How could he live without doing anything after what he had suffered? He made a valid judgment. It doesn't matter if they say he was selfish or that his methods were wrong. Victim? Perpetrator? What does that mean? It's just reality. Something happened. A phenomenon occurred. Kiyoshi's life had already gone awry. To survive, he had to return to the starting point by any means necessary. It wasn't a struggle, but calmly doing the homework that needed to be done. Purpose, goal, dream. In other words, hope. For Kiyoshi, that must be revenge. Watch from somewhere. Someday he will take on the role of a prosecutor. After that, Iyota Kiyoshi, who finished everything, hid in the routine of daily life. He watches as a 'stranger.' Whether he sees through a camera, the audience, Misaki Toka, or his own life is uncertain. One thing is certain: it's about the starting point. Takikawa Akari, the world-renowned author who wrote the original 'Najikiseng,' was amazed. Naturally, it was because of the ending that Director Kyotaro brought with a request for revision. Akari, with glasses perched on her nose, lowered the paper she was holding. And then. \\"Did Mr. Woojin suggest this ending?\\" She thought of Kang Woojin, the actor from Korea. The reason she was so surprised was simple. She had considered this ending in the past. No, to be precise, this ending was the real one. \\"The details are a bit different, but the ending is similar.\\" Before publication, the original ending of 'Najikiseng' was that Kiyoshi lived among ordinary people. Of course, the details of the scenes and direction were different from what Director Kyotaro brought, but the meaning was the same. However, at that time, Akari decided to change the ending she had set. There were too many interests involved. Moreover, her fans worldwide were also a problem. The zeitgeist of the past played a part as well. Whatever it was, the original ending had to be buried in Akari's heart. After a long time, an actor from another country suddenly brought up the ending she had buried. \\"Why did I even think of this?\\" Akari, who had many works turned into movies or dramas, had never had any actor suggest a correction to her. Kang Woojin was the first. Akari's eyes slowly met with Director Kyotaro. \\"Did Mr. Woojin suggest this direction and detailed settings?\\" Director Kyotaro shook his head slightly. \\"No. The scenes, locations, and detailed settings were added by me. But the core idea was Mr. Woojin's.\\" \\"How so?\\" \\"Denying the concept of karma.\\" Director Kyotaro, with his hair full of gray, recited the words he had heard from Woojin calmly. \\"Kiyoshi doesn't suit karma, and living well without any harm suits his character, he said.\\" \\"Living well.\\" \\"Yes. And that Iyota Kiyoshi seems to be falling apart.\\" \\"Huh-\\" A smile quickly spread across Akari's face. \\"Mr. Woojin must have been sincerely facing Kiyoshi.\\" \\"Of course, otherwise such a conclusion couldn't have come out.\\" \\"He's a strange actor. Pretending not to see while seeing everything, pretending not to know while knowing everything. It feels like being exposed.\\" \\"Feeling exposed?\\" To the repeated question, Akari, who exhaled lightly, explained the past of 'Najikiseng.' That there was an original ending. That it was covered up. And up to now. \\"Thinking about it now, I think I was scared. That's why I adjusted Kiyoshi to reality. Even though I knew it was running away.\\" \\"I understand. I was like that in the past too. No, even now. I think that result has created the current content market in Japan. Everyone is just too scared.\\" The two giants shared a slightly bitter smile. Akari was the first to speak. \\"There's so much to learn even at this age. I never thought I'd learn from a Korean actor. I envy that fearless momentum more than the cold-hearted ruthlessness.\\" \\"Kang Woojin has always been like that. A monster that doesn't compromise with the world. That's the realm of talent, something you can't imitate.\\" Suddenly, Akari, with a serious face, changed the subject. \\"If you go with this ending— it's a direct challenge to the content market that has been built up in Japan so far. It's a declaration of war to break it down.\\" \\"I know.\\" \\"There might be a disaster. Severe backlash from the public, tremendous complaints from the original hardcore fans, and violent resistance from the industry. You won't be welcomed.\\" \\"There might be a huge controversy or a lot of criticism. But still, I think I would regret it for the rest of my life if it's not this ending.\\" Director Kyotaro, who met Akari's eyes, smiled gracefully. \\"If someone wants to change something, it's natural for someone to bleed. Ah, of course, the author's permission is most important.\\" \\"Call.\\" \\"Thank you, author.\\" \\"But are you okay with taking all the responsibility, Director? You can mention me at the press conference.\\" \\"No. I can't cause harm to the original author. And besides me, Mr. Woojin will also share it. Since he's the actor who played the role. So I've already talked to him about it.\\" \\"What did Mr. Woojin say?\\" \\"He said, 'I don't really care.'\\" \\"That's so like him.\\" Akari, who burst into a chuckle, remembered Kang Woojin's indifferent face. \\"Someday, I should write him as the protagonist of my work.\\" A few hours later, around late lunchtime. Kang Woojin could be found on the set of 'Najikiseng.' About a hundred staff members bustling around. Japanese actors doing their respective tasks, such as looking at the continuity. Today's 'Najikiseng' gathering was a bit late due to Director Kyotaro's schedule. But Woojin, sitting in a chair, was already transformed into Kiyoshi with his costume and makeup. As always, he was solemn. But his mind was elsewhere. \\"Huh- Suddenly I'm craving spicy soybean paste stew. That's the problem when you're in another country, tsk. Can't help it, I have to suggest going to a Korean restaurant today.\\" Of course, to the outside world, he seemed to be cynically looking at the continuity. That's when. \\"Woojin!!\\" From between the sets, near the monitors or where the key staff were gathered, the assistant director called for Kang Woojin. Was it a standby? But it wasn't. \\"Are you available for a moment??!\\" After exchanging glances with Choi Seonggeon, Woojin got up from his chair and walked over nonchalantly. As Woojin approached, the assistant director and key staff stepped aside. What remained was Director Kyotaro holding the shooting continuity, and Mana Kosaku, who played the role of detective 'Yoshizawa Mochio.' The three gathered, and Director Kyotaro spoke. \\"The ending of 'Najikiseng' will change.\\" Soon, the face of Mana Kosaku, with deep facial lines, widened slightly. On the contrary, Kang Woojin maintained a poker face. It was expected rather than a concept. \\"Oh- Did it work??\\" It was natural since it was Kang Woojin's suggestion. Then, Kosaku, who became serious, asked. \\"The ending is changing? Does that mean we're removing a significant part of the existing screenplay?\\" \\"The last part of 'Iyota Kiyoshi' will be completely redone. However, there's no need to touch the footage already shot, and the scenes of other actors won't change much either.\\" In 'Najikiseng,' the latter part and the ending were mainly handled by Kiyoshi and Detective Mochio. All other characters are removed before that. \\"Mr. Kosaku's scenes won't change much either. But the emotions and thoughts will change. Of course, the one who will be completely flipped 180 degrees is Kiyoshi.\\" In the latter part and ending of 'Najikiseng,' it was Kang Woojin who led. The direction and scenes themselves would change. On the other hand, Kosaku, who played the detective, would keep most of his scenes. However, he needed to be aware of the changing emotional line. \\"I've already informed the other actors. The shooting team is moving according to the changed ending, and the author has given the okay. I will deliver the revised continuity to both of you within today. But for now— read the content with the pre-script.\\" Director Kyotaro handed the prepared papers to Kang Woojin and Kosaku. At the same time, the two actors read the pre-script where they stood. The changed ending of 'Najikiseng,' including the scenes before and after, was also included to ensure the emotional line and direction flowed seamlessly. Woojin, with a stern face, admired it purely inside. \\"Wow- What's this? It's kind of cool?? Right, Kiyoshi should be like this to have an impact.\\" He liked the cut. He also applauded Director Kyotaro's ability. It was just a few days ago that Kang Woojin casually threw out the idea. But in that short period, Director Kyotaro brought an impressive ending. Is this what a master is? The speed of work progress and the level of screenplay work were top-tier. At this point. \\"······\\" A slight panic appeared on Kosaku's face. It's common to have content changes during the shooting of other works. Anyway, the actor has to follow the changes. The director is the final decision-maker. But for Kosaku, it was the first time the ending had changed 180 degrees. Moreover. 'Are we really going with this ending? Seriously? This won't end with just criticism.' The changed ending of 'Najikiseng' was somewhat shocking. It was beyond pioneering. The changed ending of 'Najikiseng' was trying to step on the history of the Japanese content market. Kosaku, who had been rolling in the entertainment industry for a long time, expressed his feelings honestly. \\"Director. Are you sure you want to go with this ending?\\" \\"I'm sure.\\" \\"If we go like this······the original hardcore fans might rise up.\\" \\"If it ends with that, it would be considered a minor issue.\\" \\"Excuse me?\\" Director Kyotaro, who was reminded of a future where nuclear bombs of controversy or backlash would explode, smiled faintly. His expression was filled with determination. \\"Nevertheless, the ending of 'Najikiseng' is firmly decided without any retreat.\\" Later. Before the shooting started, Mana Kosaku spoke to Kang Woojin. It was slightly cautious. \\"Mr. Woojin, are you really okay? The arrows of attack will probably be directed at you the most among the actors.\\" Kosaku was an ordinary top actor. He predicted severe anxiety because Woojin's image of falling was clear. He had plenty of such experiences. Regardless, Kang Woojin's low-toned answer was concise. \\"It's trivial.\\" It wasn't. It wouldn't be a small matter. But to Kang Woojin, it didn't matter at all. 'Just ignore it?' Woojin, whose essence was that of an ordinary citizen, had a different grain and mindset from typical actors. What does it matter if he's not guilty? Ignoring is the answer. Kosaku interpreted it differently. Kang Woojin's atmosphere was too rigid. 'He's cool. It's not bluffing or pretending to be strong. He humbly accepts without dwelling on it.' It was arrogance with a foundation, not heartlessness or hooliganism. Mana Kosaku truly thought he had to learn. 'A second-year actor, yet the qualities of a top are already complete, the attitude of a giant.' Kang Woojin was lost in thought. 'If it gets too bad, I can just run away to Korea? Ah- By then, maybe I'll just stay in Korea?' Kosaku asked calmly. \\"······Is it trivial?\\" Woojin, with a face of steel, deepened his voice. \\"Yes, very.\\" \\"You're amazing, in many ways.\\" Suddenly, what's so amazing? Although a faint smell of misunderstanding wafted, Woojin didn't ask back. It was a familiar scent. Thus, the hectic Saturday passed, and Sunday, the 23rd, dawned. The 'Najikiseng' team gathered at the set from early morning. Among them, Director Kyotaro, with his hat pressed down, asked the distributor. \\"Have you decided on the release gap between Japan and Korea?\\" \\"We plan to release in Japan first, and the release in Korea will be adjusted between two weeks to a month later. We will inform you as soon as it's confirmed.\\" \\"Hmm.\\" Director Kyotaro then asked the production team. \\"How much will the shooting schedule be delayed when we change the ending?\\" \\"We organized it yesterday, and it doesn't differ much from what we thought. It will be delayed by about two days due to casting extras and coordinating locations.\\" \\"Not bad.\\" \\"However, there will inevitably be expenses for the parts that were pre-booked in the existing shooting cuts.\\" \\"That's fine. I've spoken directly to the investors, so don't worry.\\" The main investor. In other words, Chairman Hideki. \\"A two-day delay.\\" Director Kyotaro muttered briefly and concluded. \\"Then the crank-up is confirmed for Friday, the 28th.\\" Today is the 23rd, which meant there were only about 5 days left until the end of 'Najikiseng's shooting. A few dozen minutes later. Inside a black luxury sedan driving on the roads of Tokyo. It was the car of Yoshihara Hideki, the head of the Kashihi Group, with white hairs mixed in his eyebrows. Sitting in the back seat, Chairman Hideki ended a call with someone and put down his phone. The person on the other end was Director Kyotaro, who would be at the 'Najikiseng' site. \\"Hey.\\" After hearing the news from Director Kyotaro, Chairman Hideki called his chief secretary, Lili, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Then, Lili, with a proper posture, turned around. \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" To her, Chairman Hideki gave an order. \\"Move the appointments on the 28th after visiting the 'Najikiseng' site. I have to see the last part with my own eyes.\\" After giving the order, Chairman Hideki looked out the window and smiled slightly. \\"Kang Woojin- I'm curious about how you'll adorn the last part of 'Najikiseng.'\\" Meanwhile. Kang Woojin, who had just opened his eyes wide on the hotel room bed. \\"Ah- So tired.\\" With a groggy mind, he picked up any script or screenplay piled on the nearby table. It was to rest a bit more due to the accumulated fatigue. -Thump! Kang Woojin entered the endlessly dark void. He yawned wide and stretched out. He could just lie down. That moment. \\"Ah.\\" Woojin, who habitually looked at the white squares, paused. One of the white squares, 'Najikiseng,' showed a change. -[7/Scenario (Title: The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger), SSS Grade] Far from falling, the grade had actually risen. < Chronicles (2) > The End"},{"instruction":"< 역대 (6) > 한 맨션 앞에 허름한 카키색 재킷을 걸친, 약간 머리가 부스스한 남자가 섰다. 턱엔 까끌한 수염이 자랐고 의욕상실이 묻은 힘 빠진 표정의 남자였다. “후우-” 그가 2층의 낡은 맨션을 올려보다가 담배 연기를 적당히 뿜었다. 카메라, 그의 뒷모습을 찍다가 천천히 옆으로 움직인다. 남자는 형사 요시자와 모치오였다. 오늘은 후배 형사 없이 혼자인 모양. 그런 모치오가 담배를 입에 문 채 작게 읊조렸다. “그자가 여기 사는 건가. 평범한데.” 모치오는 오늘 연쇄적으로 일어난 사망 사건들의 마무리를 하고 온 참이었다. 명확하게 말하자면 대외적인 결말이었다. 경찰이 대중들에게 사건에 관한 전말을 정식으로 발표했다. “······” 범인도, 피해자도 모두 죽었다. 코나카야마 긴조를 죽인 미사키 슈토쿠를 시작으로, 모두가 얽히고설킨 실타래처럼 서로를 죽였다. 추가로 ‘미사키 토카’의 스토리도 밝혀졌지만 세상에 알려지진 않았다. 너무 오래됐고, 나머지 연쇄적인 사망 사건들이 몇 배는 더 자극적이었으니. 아니 남은 게 있긴 한가? 그래, 확고한 정황과 증거품들. 다른 의심을 품기엔 정황과 남은 증거가 너무 확실했고, 국민은 두려움에 떨고 있었다. 경찰은 최대한 빨리 사건들의 마무리를 발표하는 게 당연했다. 하지만. -스윽. 단 한 명. 지금 새 담배를 꺼내 입에 문 형사 모치오만이 아직 사건의 종결을 내지 않았다. 그의 머릿속엔 두 가지가 맴돌고 있었다. 공범. 그리고 ‘이요타 키요시’. 형사 모치오가 양손을 재킷 주머니에 쑤신 채 발을 뗐다. -캉, 캉, 캉. 철제 계단을 느릿하게 오른다. 2층의 복도 끝. 제일 마지막에 있는 집에 그가 살고 있다. 모치오가 찾는 그 남자. 카메라, 뒷걸음질 치며 복도를 걷는 모치오를 앞에서 잡는다. 곧. “······” 복도 끝에 도착한 모치오가 손을 올려 문을 두드리려던 때였다. -철컥! 급작스레 열린 철문이 모치오의 머리를 팍하고 때렸다. “읏!” 머리를 감싼 모치오가 작게 신음했고, 집에서 나온 남자가 흠칫 놀라며 모치오에게 바로 말했다. 아니 역정냈다에 가까울 것이다. “깜짝이야, 뭐야 당신?” 미간을 좁힌 남자가 두 손으로 머리를 감싼, 허리를 작게 숙인 모치오를 노려봤다. 의심이 깊다. 남자가 복도 주변을 두리번거린다. 그리곤 다시금 모치오에게 짜증 냈다. “놀랐잖아. 여기서 뭘 하는 거냐고 당신.” 머리를 감싼 모치오가 ‘크’ 따위의 소리를 내며 주머니서 뭔가를 꺼냈다. 형사 수첩이었다. “형사입니다, 갑자기 열려서 못 피했네요.” “······형사? 형사님이 왜 내 집 앞에 있는 겁니까? 아! 이건 정당방위! 아- 아니, 뜻이 좀 다른가?” “예?” “아니, 형사님을 가격한 게 내 잘못이 아니란 얘깁니다.” “탓을 하는 건 아닙니다만.” “당연하지!” 남자의 음성이 살짝 경박했다. 그런 그를 잠시간 지긋이 보는 모치오. 곧, 모치오가 형사 수첩을 주머니에 넣으며 남자에게 물었다. “······이요타 키요시씨가 맞습니까?” “어라? 뭐야? 내 이름을 어떻게 알고- 설마 나를 찾아온 겁니까?” “그렇습니다.” 약간 눈이 커진 남자. 아니, 이요타 키요시가 묘한 표정을 지으며 턱을 긁었다. “나, 나를 왜요?” 단박에 긴장하는 키요시. 반면, 작게 고개를 꺾은 모치오는 별거 아니라는 듯 답했다. “‘미사키 토카’를 기억하십니까?” 키요시가 팔짱 낀 채 눈동자를 위로 올렸다. 생각이 깊어진 듯. 하지만 기억에 없는지 어깨를 으쓱였다. 움직임이나 목소리가 가볍다. “누구야, 그게. 처음 듣는데요?” 여기서 잠시간 침묵. 5초 정도. 이내 쿄타로 감독의 외침이 울렸다. “컷컷컷! OOOOK!!” 만족의 사인이었다. 동시에 키요시. 아니, 강우진과 마나 코사쿠가 철계단을 내려왔다. 그들에게 여러 스탭들이 붙는다. 메이크업 수정을 위해서였다. 뒤이어 쿄타로 감독도 합류했다. “콘티대로는 이 컷까지만 가겠습니다, 이후론 일전에 말씀드린 대로 자유롭게 부탁합니다. 뒤쪽 장면도 이런 식으로, 먼저 기존의 것을 찍은 후 자유롭게 찍는 컷을 번갈아 가겠습니다.” 한 번에 롱테이크로 가는 것이 아닌, 컷마다 기존의 것과 자유롭게 가는 것을 나눠서 가겠다는 소리. 이어진 강우진과 마나 코사쿠의 간결한 대답. “예, 감독님.” “네.” 방금의 씬은 이미 3번째 정도 반복했고 여기서부턴 촬영 콘티를 벗어나 배우들 멋대로, 쿄타로 감독이 아카리 작가에게도 말했던 배우 둘이 자유롭게 활개 칠 차례. 물론, 연출, 상황, 배역의 감정, 갈등은 유지하면서 말이다. 이에 두 배우를 보는 200명에 가까운 인원들이 몰린 세트장의 공기가 변했다. “이, 이제 시작하는군.” “대사도 강우진씨와 마나 코사쿠씨가 마음대로 하는 건가요?” “그렇다고 들었어.” 백여 명 스탭들은 물론이고 영화사, 배급사 간부들. “이렇게 가는 컷은 처음 봐, 괜찮은 거겠지?” “글쎄- 그런데 헐리웃에선 종종 이렇게 배우에게 맡기곤 해. 감독과 배우의 시선은 다르니까. 일본에선 볼 일이 없어, 솔직히 나도 듣기는 했지만 처음 봐.” “지금 것도 나쁘진 않은데 말이지. 가뜩이나 많은 도전이 섞였는데, 괜히 무리하는 거 아닌가?” “여기까지 왔으니 지켜보는 수밖에.” 감독 자리 뒤쪽에 앉은, 코끝에 안경을 걸친 아카리 작가는 딱히 말이 없었다. 신기함도 있다. 자신이 쓴 작품의 장면을 두 눈으로 보고 있으니까. 하지만 표정은 굳었다. “······” 방금 본 건 이미 그녀도 알고 있는 컷이었다. 거기다 충분히 만족할 정도의 그림이 뽑혔다. 다만, 여기서부터는 미지였다. 이때. “작가님.” 그녀의 오른쪽에서 까끌한 늙은 음성이 들렸다. 정장 재킷은 벗은, 주변에 비서들을 대동한 히데키 회장이었다. 그가 앉은 채로 잠잠히 물었다. “방금의 키요시는 좀 유난이었던 것 같은데. 원래는 저런 캐릭터가 아니었지요?” “아- 맞아요. 콘티상 키요시는 모치오 형사가 올 걸 알고 있었고, 적당한 연기를 가미한 상태예요.” “원래의 모습을 숨기기 위한?” “네. 혼동을 주는 거예요. 모치오 형사가 기민하다는 걸 키요시는 알고 있거든요. 이 장면은 원작에서도 적당히 표현되기도 하지만, 감독님이 이 컷에 좀 더 욕심을 내시면서 세세한 연출과 각색을 첨가하셨어요.” “그럼 이제 달라진다는 건가요? 배우들이 시나리오를 벗어나 편하게 연기한다고 들었는데.” “······저도 그걸 보러 왔어요.” “흠- 그렇군요.” 안광이 빛나는 히데키 회장이 정면을 향했다. ‘흔히 볼 수 없는 구경을 하는군. 허나 역시 쉽지는 않은 겐가? 스탭들의 긴장도가 높아졌어.’ 강우진과 마나 코사쿠에게 설명을 마친 쿄타로 감독은 촬영존에서 빠지고 있었다. 메이크업 수정을 마친 스탭들도 마찬가지. 강우진과 코사쿠는 잠시잠깐 짧은 대화를 할 뿐 이렇다 할 계획을 짜진 않는 것 같다. 서로의 느낌을 중요시하겠다는 걸까? 사실이었다. 두 배우. 즉, 우진과 코사쿠는 서로 합의 한 부분이 있었다. 시작은 코사쿠의 제안부터였다. “서로 기본적인 핵심 대사들은 유지하되, 나머지 자유 연기들은 알리는 것 없이 편하게 가보죠.” 짜지 말자는 것이었다. 그야말로 실제 ‘낯기생’의 인물이 되어, 무분별하게 들이닥치는 감정에 상황에 연기에 몸을 맡겨보자는 뜻. 강우진으로서는 반대할 이유가 1도 없었다. “알겠습니다.” 나야 그게 더 편하니까. 아니 애초에 일일이 알려주는 게 더 웃기다. 그래서는 배우들의 자유에 맡기는 게 아니잖아? 강우진이 시니컬하게 답했다. “편히 가겠습니다.” 진심이었다. 몇십 분 뒤. 슬슬 재촬영의 준비가 끝났다. 우르르 빠진 백여 명 스탭들은 촬영존을 둥그렇게 감싼 채 숨을 죽였고, 영화사나 배급사 간부들 등도 진중한 얼굴로 세트에 시선을 고정했다. 아카리 작가의 눈엔 묘한 기대와 걱정이 서렸고, 그녀의 오른쪽 히데키 회장은 속을 알기 힘든 얼굴이었다. “······” 촬영 감독과 잠시간의 대화를 마친 쿄타로 감독이 여러 모니터가 놓인 자리에 앉았다. “후우-” 작은 숨을 뱉으며 스탭에게 손짓했다. 남자 스탭 한 명이 튀어나와 카메라 앞에서 슬레이트를 쳤다. -탁! 쓴 모자를 벗은 쿄타로 감독이 확성기를 들었다. 그의 입에서 ‘액션’이 뱉어지기 직전. 세트 맨션 쪽의 강우진은 이미 철문을 닫고 안쪽에 들어와 있었다. 그리곤. ‘일단-’ 재빨리 이요타 키요시를 끌어올렸다. 금세 우진이 보는 세상은 ‘낯기생’이 됐다. 모든 것이 키요시가 됐지만 강우진은 왜인지 작업을 멈추지 않았다. 지금의 그는 과거와 달랐다. 현재 강우진에겐 최근에 추가된 능력인 ‘배역의 자유도’가 있다. 틀은 깨졌다. 숱한 가능성이 넘쳐난다. 뭐, 사실 깨진 지는 꽤 됐고 우진은 이미 숙달됐다. 극단적으로 말하자면, 지금 강우진은 ‘이요타 키요시’ 자체를 유지하면서도 뜬금 탈춤을 출 수 있었다. 다만, 우진은 탈춤 대신 다른 것을 꺼낸다. 사실 이미 며칠 전부터 정해둔 답이 있었으니까. ‘배역합성은 일단 필요해.’ 어차피 키요시가 형사 모치오를 보며 적당한 연기를 가미하는 컷이었다. 그러니 배역합성은 유용할 것이다. 하지만 우진은 키요시의 근간을 버리긴 싫었다. 키요시는 끝까지 키요시스러움이 있길 바랐다. 연기 속에 연기를 하더라도 말이다. 그러니 배역합성으로 호출한 배역은 키요시와 비슷하면서도 반전을 때릴 수 있어야 한다. 역시 강우진은 생각해둔 소환수가 있다. “······” 이미 키요시로 팽배한 강우진에게 다른 냄새가 겹쳐진다. 주인의 호출에 소환수가 응답한 것이었다. 배역합성은 삽시간에 이루어졌다. 여기까진 맛보기. 이 뒤부터가 진짜다. 배역합성으로 끌어낸 소환수와 함께 키요시의 근간을 유지한다. 하지만 강우진은 시나리오의 틀을 깰 예정이다. ‘배역의 자유도’를 해금한다. 와중 이 같은 상황을 알 턱이 없는, 철문 밖의 마나 코사쿠는 형사 모치오의 감정을 복기하면서도 속으로 다짐 중이었다. ‘괜찮다, 의연하게 가면 돼. 어차피 자유에 맡기더라도 극 중의 상황은 같다. 키요시보다 모치오의 상황이 더 우위야. 키요시는 숨겨야 하고 나는 그가 숨기는 걸 어렴풋 눈치채고 있다.’ 어떤 연기가 닥쳐와도 편하게 대처할 것을 말이다. ‘공격한다면 오히려 내 쪽이야. 그를, 키요시를 쉽게 보내줄 생각은 없다.’ 두 배우는 그야말로 ‘낯기생’의 인물로서 미지의 영역에 내던져졌다. 이때. “하이- 액션!” 감독의 사인이 울렸다. 곧, 마나 코사쿠가. 아니, 형사 모치오가 두 손을 재킷에 쑤신 채 움직인다. 캉캉캉 소리를 내며 철제 계단을 올랐다. 카메라는 그 뒤를 따랐다가 그의 앞으로 움직였다. 어느새 도착한 복도 끝. 하지만. “······” 조용하다. 원래의 시나리오대로라면 철문이 열려야 했다. 그러나 미동도 없다. 시작부터 틀이 깨졌다. 허나 형사 모치오는 대수롭지 않다. 그가 머리를 긁었다. 그리곤 철문을 두드렸다. -똑똑. 3초, 5초, 10초. 미동은 없다. 모치오는 작게 한숨을 쉬며 턱을 긁었다. “집에 없나?” 재차 문을 두드리는 그. -똑똑똑. 이번엔 처음보다 강도가 세다. 그래도 철문은 열릴 기미가 없다. 뭐지? 형사 모치오가 복도를 두리번하다가 픽 웃었다. “암호라도 대라는 것 같군.” 자연스러운 애드립. 모니터에 코를 박은 쿄타로 감독도 만족스러운지 읊조렸다. “좋아, 그렇게.” 어쨌든 문은 열리지 않는다. 형사 모치오가 철문 앞에서 손목시계를 보려 고개를 내렸을 때였다. -철컥! 돌연 철문이 열리며 형사 모치오의 머리를 강하게 때렸다. 팍 소리와 함께 모치오가 약간 휘청했고, 문 안쪽에서 무던한 얼굴의 이요타 키요시가 고개를 빼꼼 내밀었다. 하지만 입을 열진 않았다. “······” 그저. “크으-” 고통을 호소하는 모치오 형사를 가만히 바라볼 뿐. 키요시의 얼굴엔 그닥 표정이 없다. 재밌는 것은. -스윽. 모치오 형사와 철문을 번갈아 본 키요시의 눈동자에 놀람이 가득해졌다는 것. 바로 표정이 서렸다. 늘 표정 없던 그와는 다른 모습이었다. 그럼에도 전체적인 표정은 딱딱했다. 그리고 말도 없다. “······” 키요시가 약간 양손을 움찔대며 멈칫멈칫한다. 그 모습을 모치오가 확인했다. 한 손으로 머리를 누르며 남은 손으로는 형사 수첩을 꺼낸다. 그 수첩을 키요시에게 보이며 모치오가 말했다. “크으- 아아, 괜찮습니다. 뒤늦게 여셔서 피할 새가 없었네요. 신경 쓰지 마세요. 전 형삽니다. 이요타 키요시씨 맞죠?” “······” 물음이 던져졌으나 키요시는 놀란 채 두 눈만 끔뻑일 뿐 답하지 않았다. 모치오가 수첩을 재킷에 넣으며 작게 미소지었다. 여전히 한 손은 머리 위에 얹었다. “이요타 키요시씨 아니십니까?” 모치오가 키요시와 눈을 맞췄다. 그는 안경을 쓰고 있었다. 복장은 간단한 셔츠였다. 회색에 가까운 셔츠. 뭐랄까, 어디서나 흔히 볼 수 있는 느낌. 신경 쓰지 않는다면 그 누구도 기억하지 못할 모습이었다. 묘한 것은 그의 행동이다. ‘왜 반응이 없지?’ 이상했다. 분명, 그랬다. 지금 눈앞의 키요시는 본연의 것과 어수룩한 또는 서투른 청년 같은 냄새가 뒤섞였다. 그래, 마치 두 인물이 합쳐진 것처럼. 코사쿠 또는 모치오가 일단 찔러보자는 식으로 다시 말했다. “아아, 긴장하지 마세요. 일본 전체로 큰 사건이 났지만, 이 근방에선 별일 없습니다. 그저 몇 가지 여쭤볼 게 있어서요.” “······” 이번에도 대답이 없는 키요시. 그럼에도 그의 눈은 모치오 형사를 빤히 응시하고 있다. 뭔가 시선이 묘하다. 어딜 보고 있는 거야? 그보다 침묵? 모치오는 키요시가 지금 얼었다고 판단했다. 입을 다물겠다? ‘머릿속으로 재빨리 계산하고 있는 거야, 말을 하지 않는 것은 긴장감을 숨기려는 것이고.’ 하지만 틈을 줄 순 없지. 어느새 미소를 머금은, 턱에 까끌하게 난 수염이 눈에 띄는 형사 모치오가 키요시에게 다시 물었다. “이요타 키요시씨, 역시 제가 올 걸 알고 있었죠?” 표정에 큰 변화가 없는 키요시. 이쯤 세트장에 있는 200명 넘는 모두는 이상함을 감지했다. ‘왜- 아무 말도 안 해?’ ‘혹시 대사를 까먹었다거나? 아니 자유로이 하는데 까먹을 게 있나?’ ‘괜···찮은 건가.’ 이는 모니터를 응시하는 쿄타로 감독도 마찬가지였다. ‘침묵. 그가 짜온 건 침묵인가? 끝까지 입을 다물 셈?’ 그건 그것대로 나쁘지 않았다. 하지만 의아한 것은 지워지지 않는다. 두 인물의 냄새가 섞인듯한 첫 등장까진 좋았는데 그대로 침묵인 건 너무 슴슴하니까. 이때였다. -스윽. 200여 명 인물의 시선을 독차지한 강우진 또는 키요시가 처음으로 움직였다. 한 손을 들어 자신의 가슴에 올린다. 모션에 예의가 담겼다. 이어 어렵사리 입을 연다. “아, 아- 으아-” 우진이 급작스레 신음을 냈다. 아니, 신음이 아닌가? 곧, 쿄타로 감독을 시작으로 전부의 눈에 물음표가 떴다. 특히, 강우진을 바로 앞에서 보고 있는 모치오 형사가 제일 극심했다. ‘뭐···라고? 무슨 소리를 하는 거지?’ 미간을 팍 좁힌 모치오가 키요시에게 되물었다. “예? 이봐요, 지금 혹시 저를 놀리는 겁니까?” 하지만 강우진은 여전히 비슷한 신음을 하다가. “으, 아- 아-” 급작스레 두 손을 올렸다. 모치오 형사는 본능적으로 움찔하며 방어태세에 돌입했지만, 강우진의 두 손은 그를 공격하기 위함이 아니었다. -스으. 그의 두 손은 허공에서 부드럽게 비행을 시작했다. [“죄송합니다, 저는 형사님의 말이 잘 들리지 않아요.”] 일본 수어였다. [“형사님도 이 수어의 뜻을 알지 못하겠죠?”] 키요시가 수어를 하고 있었다. 순간, 모니터 보던 쿄타로 감독이 두 눈을 확장 시키며 고개를 훅 올렸다. 세트 맨션 안의 강우진을 본 것. ‘수, 수어?!’ 더불어 전혀 예상치 못한 연기에 모치오가 얼어붙었다. “아······” 형사 모치오가 명백히 당황한 것이었다. < 역대 (6) > 끝","output":"< Chronicles (6) > A man in a shabby khaki jacket with slightly disheveled hair stood in front of a mansion. He had a prickly beard on his chin and a listless expression that spoke of a loss of motivation. \\"Huff-\\" He looked up at the old two-story mansion and exhaled a puff of cigarette smoke appropriately. The camera, capturing his back, slowly moved to the side. The man was Detective Yoshizawa Mochio. It seemed he was alone today, without his junior detective. Mochio, with a cigarette in his mouth, muttered softly. \\"He lives here, huh. It's quite ordinary.\\" Mochio had come after wrapping up a series of death cases that had occurred consecutively. To be clear, it was the official conclusion. The police had formally announced the full story of the case to the public. \\"······\\" Both the perpetrator and the victims were dead. Starting with Misaki Shutoku, who killed Konakayama Kinzo, everyone was entangled like a knotted thread, killing each other. Additionally, the story of 'Misaki Toka' was revealed, but it was not made known to the world. It was too old, and the other consecutive death cases were several times more sensational. Is there anything left? Yes, solid circumstances and evidence. The circumstances and remaining evidence were too conclusive to harbor any other suspicions, and the public was trembling in fear. It was only natural for the police to announce the conclusion of the cases as quickly as possible. However. -Swish. Just one person. Detective Mochio, who now took out a new cigarette and put it in his mouth, had not yet concluded the case. Two things were swirling in his head. An accomplice. And 'Iyota Kiyoshi.' Detective Mochio put his hands in his jacket pockets and took a step. -Clang, clang, clang. He ascended the metal staircase slowly. At the end of the second-floor corridor. The last house was where the man he was looking for lived. Mochio was looking for that man. The camera, retreating down the corridor, captures Mochio from the front. Soon. \\"······\\" When Mochio reached the end of the corridor and was about to knock on the door. -Click! The metal door suddenly opened and struck Mochio's head. \\"Ouch!\\" Mochio, holding his head, groaned softly, and the man who came out of the house was startled and immediately spoke to Mochio. It was almost like he was scolding. \\"You scared me, who are you?\\" The man with narrowed brows glared at Mochio, who was holding his head and slightly bent over. There was deep suspicion. The man looked around the corridor and then snapped at Mochio again. \\"I was startled. What are you doing here?\\" Mochio, still holding his head, made a 'kr' sound and took something out of his pocket. It was a detective's notebook. \\"I'm a detective, the door opened suddenly, and I couldn't avoid it.\\" \\"······Detective? Why is a detective in front of my house? Ah! This is self-defense! Ah- no, is that a bit different?\\" \\"Excuse me?\\" \\"I mean, it's not my fault that I hit you, the detective.\\" \\"I'm not blaming you, but.\\" \\"Of course!\\" The man's voice was slightly frivolous. Mochio watched him for a moment, then put the detective's notebook back in his pocket and asked the man. \\"······Are you Iyota Kiyoshi?\\" \\"Huh? What? How do you know my name- did you come looking for me?\\" \\"That's right.\\" The man, slightly wide-eyed. No, Iyota Kiyoshi scratched his chin with a strange expression. \\"Why me?\\" Kiyoshi tensed up immediately. In contrast, Mochio, who tilted his head slightly, replied as if it was nothing. \\"Do you remember 'Misaki Toka'?\\" Kiyoshi crossed his arms and looked up, as if deep in thought. But he shrugged his shoulders, indicating he had no memory of her. His movements and voice were light. \\"Who's that? I've never heard of her.\\" A brief silence followed. About 5 seconds. Then, Director Kyotaro's voice rang out. \\"Cut, cut, cut! OOOOK!!\\" It was a sign of satisfaction. At the same time, Kiyoshi. No, Kang Woojin and Mana Kosaku came down the metal staircase. Several staff members approached them. It was for makeup touch-ups. Director Kyotaro joined them shortly after. \\"We'll go with the cut as per the continuity for now, and as I mentioned before, please feel free to proceed afterward. For the scenes in the back, we'll shoot the existing ones first and then alternate with freely shot cuts.\\" They were going to split between sticking to the existing script and going freely for each cut. The concise responses from Kang Woojin and Mana Kosaku followed. \\"Yes, Director.\\" \\"Okay.\\" The scene had already been repeated about three times, and from here on, the actors were free to spread their wings beyond the shooting continuity, as Director Kyotaro had told Akari. Of course, while maintaining the direction, situation, and emotional conflict of the roles. With this, the atmosphere in the set, crowded with nearly 200 people, changed. \\"Now, it's starting.\\" \\"Are the actors Kang Woojin and Mana Kosaku going to improvise their lines?\\" \\"That's what I heard.\\" Not only the hundred or so staff members but also executives from the film company and distributors. \\"I've never seen a cut like this before, is it okay?\\" \\"Well- Hollywood often leaves it to the actors like this. The director and actors have different perspectives. It's not something you see in Japan, honestly, I've heard of it but never seen it.\\" \\"The current one isn't bad either. With so many challenges already mixed in, aren't they overdoing it?\\" \\"We've come this far, we can only watch.\\" Akari, the author sitting behind the director's chair with glasses on her nose, didn't say much. There was a sense of wonder. She was watching a scene from her own work with her own eyes. But her expression was stern. \\"······\\" What she had just seen was a cut she already knew. Moreover, it was satisfactory enough. However, from here on, it was unknown. At that moment. \\"Author.\\" A scratchy old voice came from her right. It was Chairman Hideki, who had taken off his suit jacket and brought his secretaries with him. He asked quietly while sitting. \\"The Kiyoshi just now seemed a bit excessive. He wasn't originally such a character, was he?\\" \\"Ah- yes. In the continuity, Kiyoshi knew that Detective Mochio was coming and was acting accordingly.\\" \\"To hide his true self?\\" \\"Yes. It's to create confusion. Kiyoshi knows that Detective Mochio is sharp. This scene is somewhat depicted in the original work, but Director Kyotaro was more ambitious with this cut, adding detailed direction and adaptation.\\" \\"So it's going to change now? I heard the actors are going to act freely outside the script.\\" \\"······I came to see that too.\\" \\"Hmm- I see.\\" Chairman Hideki's eyes shone as he faced forward. 'I'm witnessing something rarely seen. But is it not easy after all? The staff's tension has risen.' After explaining to Kang Woojin and Mana Kosaku, Director Kyotaro was leaving the shooting zone. The staff who finished the makeup touch-ups did the same. Kang Woojin and Kosaku seemed to have a brief conversation but didn't appear to be planning anything in particular. Are they prioritizing each other's feelings? That was indeed the case. The two actors. That is, Woojin and Kosaku had agreed on something. It started with Kosaku's suggestion. \\"Let's maintain the basic key lines, but for the rest of the free acting, let's go comfortably without informing each other.\\" It was a suggestion not to plan. It meant to become the actual characters of 'Najikiseng,' to entrust themselves to the emotions and situations that came crashing in without discrimination. For Kang Woojin, there was no reason to object. \\"Understood.\\" It's more comfortable for me that way. Besides, it's funnier to inform each other of every little thing. That's not leaving it to the actors' freedom, is it? Kang Woojin replied cynically. \\"I'll go comfortably.\\" He meant it. A few dozen minutes later. The preparations for the reshoot were slowly coming to an end. The hundred or so staff members who had withdrawn surrounded the shooting zone in a circle, holding their breath, and executives from the film company and distributors also fixed their serious gazes on the set. Akari's eyes were filled with a strange expectation and worry, and Chairman Hideki to her right had an inscrutable face. \\"······\\" After a brief conversation with the director of photography, Director Kyotaro sat down at the monitors. \\"Huff-\\" He exhaled a small breath and gestured to a staff member. A male staff member jumped out and clapped the slate in front of the camera. -Clap! Director Kyotaro, who had taken off his hat, picked up the megaphone. Just before the word 'action' left his lips, Kang Woojin inside the mansion set had already closed the metal door and entered inside. And then. 'First-' He quickly brought up Iyota Kiyoshi. Soon, the world Woojin saw became 'Najikiseng.' Everything turned into Kiyoshi, but for some reason, Woojin did not stop working. He was different from the past. Currently, Kang Woojin had a recently added ability called 'Role Freedom.' The framework was broken. There were countless possibilities. Well, it had been broken for quite some time, and Woojin was already proficient. To put it extremely, Kang Woojin could now dance a wild dance while maintaining 'Iyota Kiyoshi.' However, Woojin chose something else instead of a wild dance. In fact, he had already decided on an answer a few days ago. 'I need Role Fusion first.' After all, it was a cut where Kiyoshi was supposed to act appropriately while being aware of Detective Mochio. So Role Fusion would be useful. But Woojin didn't want to abandon the foundation of Kiyoshi. He hoped that Kiyoshi would remain Kiyoshi-like to the end, even if it meant acting within acting. Therefore, the role he called upon through Role Fusion had to be similar to Kiyoshi but also capable of delivering a twist. Of course, Kang Woojin had a summoned creature in mind. \\"······\\" Another scent overlapped with Woojin, who was already pervaded by Kiyoshi. The summoned creature responded to the master's call. Role Fusion happened in an instant. This was just a taste. The real deal was yet to come. With Role Fusion, he maintained the foundation of Kiyoshi, but Kang Woojin planned to break the script's framework. He unlocked 'Role Freedom.' Meanwhile, Mana Kosaku, who had no idea about this situation outside the metal door, was recalling Detective Mochio's emotions while also resolving to himself. 'It's okay, just proceed calmly. Even if we leave it to freedom, the situation in the play is the same. Mochio's situation is more advantageous than Kiyoshi's. Kiyoshi has to hide, and I'm vaguely aware that he's hiding something.' It meant to deal comfortably with whatever acting came his way. 'If I attack, it's rather from my side. I have no intention of letting him, Kiyoshi, go easily.' The two actors were truly thrown into the unknown realm as characters of 'Najikiseng.' At that moment. \\"Ready- action!\\" The director's signal rang out. Soon, Mana Kosaku. No, Detective Mochio put his hands in his jacket and moved. He climbed the metal staircase with a clang, clang, clang. The camera followed him and then moved in front of him. He had arrived at the end of the corridor. But. \\"······\\" It was quiet. According to the original script, the metal door should have opened. But there was no movement. The framework was broken from the start. However, Detective Mochio was not bothered. He scratched his head. Then he knocked on the metal door. -Knock, knock. 3 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds. There was no movement. Mochio sighed softly and scratched his chin. \\"Is nobody home?\\" He knocked on the door again. -Knock, knock, knock. This time the knocks were stronger than before. Still, the metal door showed no sign of opening. What's going on? Detective Mochio looked around the corridor and chuckled. \\"It's as if I need to say a password.\\" A natural ad-lib. Director Kyotaro, with his nose buried in the monitors, also murmured in satisfaction. \\"Good, like that.\\" Regardless, the door did not open. It was when Detective Mochio looked down at his wristwatch in front of the metal door. -Click! Suddenly the metal door opened and struck Detective Mochio's head hard. With a thud, Mochio staggered slightly, and Iyota Kiyoshi with an indifferent face peeked out from inside. But he did not speak. \\"······\\" Just. \\"Kr-\\" He watched Detective Mochio, who was expressing pain, without saying a word. There wasn't much expression on Kiyoshi's face. The interesting thing was. -Swish. Kiyoshi's eyes, which alternated between looking at Detective Mochio and the metal door, were filled with surprise. His expression became serious. It was different from his usual lack of expression. Yet, his overall expression was still stiff. And he remained silent. \\"······\\" Kiyoshi hesitated slightly, moving his hands in a jerky manner. Detective Mochio noticed this. Holding his head with one hand, he took out his detective's notebook with the other. Showing the notebook to Kiyoshi, Mochio said. \\"Kr- Ah, it's okay. I couldn't avoid it because you opened the door late. Don't worry about it. I'm a detective. You are Iyota Kiyoshi, right?\\" \\"······\\" The question was thrown, but Kiyoshi, still startled, only blinked his eyes and did not answer. Mochio put the notebook back in his jacket and smiled slightly, still holding his head with one hand. \\"You are Iyota Kiyoshi, aren't you?\\" Mochio met Kiyoshi's eyes. He was wearing glasses. His attire was a simple shirt. A shirt close to gray. It was a look that could be seen anywhere. If one didn't pay attention, it was a look that no one would remember. The strange thing was his behavior. 'Why isn't he reacting?' It was odd. Definitely. The Kiyoshi in front of him now had a mix of his original self and the scent of a clumsy or inept young man. Yes, as if two characters had merged. Kosaku, or Mochio, decided to probe again. \\"Ah, don't be nervous. There's been a big incident across Japan, but nothing much around here. I just have a few questions to ask you.\\" \\"······\\" Again, Kiyoshi did not answer. Yet his eyes were staring intently at Detective Mochio. The gaze was strange. What was he looking at? More importantly, the silence? Mochio concluded that Kiyoshi was frozen. Is he choosing to remain silent? 'Is he quickly calculating in his head, not speaking to hide his nervousness?' But he couldn't give him a chance. Detective Mochio, now with a smile and a noticeable prickly beard on his chin, asked Kiyoshi again. \\"Iyota Kiyoshi, you knew I was coming, didn't you?\\" Kiyoshi's expression didn't change much. By now, everyone in the set of over 200 people sensed something was off. 'Why- isn't he saying anything?' 'Did he forget his lines or something? But if they're acting freely, what's there to forget?' 'Is it... okay?' Director Kyotaro, staring at the monitor, felt the same. 'Silence. Is that what he planned? To remain silent to the end?' That was fine in its own way. But the curiosity about the initial appearance that seemed to mix the scents of two characters, followed by silence, was too bland. At that moment. -Swish. Kang Woojin, or Kiyoshi, who had captured the attention of over 200 people, moved for the first time. He raised one hand to his chest. The motion was polite. Then he spoke with difficulty. \\"Ah, ah- uh-ah-\\" Woojin suddenly groaned. Or was it not a groan? Soon, Director Kyotaro and everyone else had question marks in their eyes. Especially Detective Mochio, who was watching Kang Woojin up close, was the most severe. 'What... did he say? What is he saying?' Detective Mochio, with narrowed brows, asked Kiyoshi. \\"Excuse me? Are you making fun of me right now?\\" But Kang Woojin continued to make similar groans. \\"Uh, ah- ah-\\" Suddenly, he raised both hands. Detective Mochio instinctively flinched and went into a defensive stance, but Kang Woojin's hands were not meant to attack him. -Swish. His hands began to move gently in the air. [\\"I'm sorry, I can't hear you well, detective.\\"] It was Japanese Sign Language. [\\"You probably don't know the meaning of this sign language, do you?\\"] Kiyoshi was using sign language. In an instant, Director Kyotaro, who was watching the monitor, widened his eyes and jerked his head up. He saw Kang Woojin inside the mansion set. 'Sign, sign language?!' Additionally, Detective Mochio was frozen by the completely unexpected acting. \\"Ah······\\" Detective Mochio was clearly flustered. < Chronicles (6) > The End"},{"instruction":"< 역대 (10) > 세계 3대 국제영화제 중 1위로 꼽히는 칸 영화제. 깐느 영화제라고도 불리며 전세계 이름값 높은 수많은 영화인이 참석하는 축제. 물론, 세계적 넘사인 아카데미상보다는 약하지만, 칸 영화제 역시 배우로서 보자면 규모가 어마무시한 행사였다. 파급력이나 영향력 역시 그랬다. 덕분에 헐리웃 탑배우들도 칸 영화제에서 수상하기 위해 기를 쓴다. 한국 쪽도 꽤 모습을 보이긴 하지만 대부분 감독이었고, 배우로 수상을 한 건 드물거나 손에 꼽는다. 프랑스, 칸 영화제. 뭐랄까- 핸드폰을 귀에 붙인 강우진에겐 현실감이 없는 단어들이었다. ‘칸이라. 칸? 직접 안 봐서 그런가? 썩 긴장되는 건 없는데.’ 물론, TV나 기사로는 몇 번 봤지만 그뿐이었다. 분위기야 뭐 얼추 청룡영화제와 비슷하겠지. 그보다 조금 더 크던가. 어쨌든 핸드폰 너머 안가복 감독의 멘트를 들었음에도 우진은 크게 떨리지 않았다. 그냥 ‘아- 9월 30일에 칸 영화제가 개막한다고?’ 정도가 다였다. 상상이야 가지만 상당히 옅었다. 그럼에도 우진은 목소리를 깔았다. 안가복 감독에게 무거운 톤을 보여야 했으니까. “9월 30일, 기억하겠습니다.” “음. 가볍게 볼 건 아니지만 그렇다고 너무 치우칠 필욘 없어요. 괜히 조급해질 뿐이지, 아직 시간이 있으니까 알고만 있어요.” “예. 일단 기억만 해두겠습니다.” “최 대표님에겐 따로 연락 안 해도 되겠지요?” “물론입니다, 제가 전달하겠습니다.” “그래요. 한국 복귀해서 봅시다. 아- 그렇지, 이건 늙은이의 노파심인데. 많은 작품 진행하더라도 ‘거머리’의 ‘박하성’은 잊으면 안 돼요.” 이 할아버지가 날 뭐로 보고? 그래도 뭐 안가복 감독의 걱정도 어렴풋 이해는 되는 우진이었다. 지금 우진이 소화하는 작품이 몇 개인가? 더군다나 한국이 아닌 타국 일본에 와있다. ‘뭐, 나를 의심하기보단 진짜 노파심이겠지.’ 이런 미친 스케줄을 소화하는 건 한국 배우 중 강우진밖에 없었다. 당연히 안가복 감독의 수십 년 경력에서도 처음 봤을 것이고. 이를 증명하듯 핸드폰 너머로 안가복 감독의 늙은 음성이 다시 들렸다. “허허, 나이를 먹으면 자꾸 걱정만 늘어.” 강우진은 이 노파심 생긴 노장에게 립서비스를 해줘야겠다 생각했다. “‘박하성’, 항시 유념하고 있습니다.” “······누구보다 우진씨가 그리 말하니 더 듬직하구만. 그래요, 이만 끊읍시다.” “예, 감독님.” -뚝. 그렇게 핸드폰을 천천히 내리는 강우진. 현재는 ‘A10 스튜디오’의 외부 주차장. 통화 하느라 걸음을 멈춘 우진이었고, 한예정 등의 팀 인원이 기다리는 눈치였기에 강우진은 일단 작게 고개를 끄덕였다. “됐어, 가자.” 다시금 움직이는 강우진 팀. 와중 우진은 제일 뒤쪽에서 걸으며 핸드폰으로 칸 영화제를 검색했다. 당연하겠지만 숱한 정보와 자료들이 쏟아졌다. 과거부터 현재까지 어마어마한 양. 기사 쪽엔 안가복 감독이 말한 내용도 보였다. 『[해외IS]깐느 영화제 9월 30일 개막 확정, 안가복 감독의 ‘거머리’ 포함 올해는 몇 개의 작품이 초정되나?』 근엄한 얼굴인 우진이 속으로 읊조렸다. ‘여튼 대단하긴 하네. 분위기만 보면 칸에 초청만 돼도 엄청 빨아주는 느낌?’ 한국의 영화판을 말하는 것. 실제로 칸에서 한국의 발자취가 가장 희미하긴 했다. 결과로는 일본이 더 앞서기도 했다. 이어 칸 영화제 관련을 구경하던 우진이 핸드폰을 주머니에 넣었다. ‘몰라- 그때 되면 알겠지. 그보다 프랑스 가는 건 겁나 기대되는데? 미친, 나 올해만 해외를 몇 번이나 가는 거냐?’ 그리곤 생각의 주제를 바꿨다. -스윽. ‘A10 스튜디오’ 건물에 점점 가까워질 때쯤 우진이 옆구리에 끼웠던 대본을 빼냈다. 뭐겠는가? 애니인 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 1화 대본이었다. 참고로 오늘 대본리딩은 일단 1화만 맞춰본다. ‘지금은 칸보다는 이쪽이 먼저지.’ 먼 미래보다는 눈앞의 일부터 처리한다는 마인드. 그럴 만도 한 게 칸도 처음이지만, 강우진에겐 애니메이션 성우도 태어나 최초였다. ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 측에서 성우 제안을 받았을 때부터 지금까지, 나름 생각이 나면 자료나 공부를 하긴 했었다. 결론은 하나였다. 확실히 배우 연기와 성우 연기는 판이하다는 것. 성우 더빙 관련 자료를 넘기던 최성건도 말했었다. 성우는 배우 연기가 분명 도움이 되겠지만 아예 다른 영역이라고. 하지만 차근차근 나아가면 된다는 말도 추가했었다. 정답이긴 했지만, 강우진에겐. -푹! 사기템인 아공간이 있었다. 우진이 ‘A10 스튜디오’에 돌입하기 전에 아공간에 먼저 입장했다. 그리곤 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 흰 사각형을 본다. -[10/대본(제목: 남사친: 리메이크), SS급] 성우의 현실 경험이 전혀 없으니 아공간의 리딩(경험)이라도 많이 해야 한다. 최소 강우진의 판단은 그랬다. “플러스 애니 세상이 존잼이기도 하고.” 이세계에 다녀온 기분을 만끽하기 위해 강우진의 손가락이 움직였다. [“······준비 완료. 완성도가 매우 높은 대본이나 시나리오입니다. 구현도는 100%입니다. 리딩을 시작합니다.”] 금세 커다란 회색이 그를 덮쳤다. 얼마나 지났나? 애니메이션 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 세상을 살던 그. 다시금 현실로 돌아온 강우진은. ‘어우 역시 꿀잼.’ 만족했다. 역시나 애니메이션의 세상은 신박하면서도 즐길 게 많았다. 애니 ‘남사친: 리메이크’는 원작 ‘남사친’이 기반이 됐지만, 일본 애니 특유의 향으로 각색됐다. 전체적인 배경은 180도 달라졌고 인물과 내용도 퍽 많은 부분이 변했다. 즉, ‘남사친’과는 전혀 다른 세계였다. 일단 배경부터가 고등학교. 당연히 배역 이름도 바뀐다. ‘남사친’에서 우진이 맞았던 ‘한인호’는 ‘남사친: 리메이크’에서 ‘센고쿠 토오루’였다. 보컬, 피아노 등으로 음악적 천재, 그러나 과거 상처가 있다. 그것을 현재는 봉인한 상태. 화린이 맡았던 ‘이보민’은 ‘엔마 쿄코’로 바뀌었다. ‘엔마 쿄코’는 ‘센고쿠 토오루’와는 소꿉친구이며 스타일이 좋아선지 학교에서 인기론 1등이다. 하지만 성격이 사납다. 애니 ‘남사친: 리메이크’는 존재감 없던 우진 또는 ‘센고쿠 토오루’가, 학교 문화제로 인해 돌연 쿄스튬을 하면서 사건이 시작된다. 변신하면서 ‘센고쿠 토오루’의 숨겨진 잘생김이 폭발하니까. 이어 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 세상을, 동시에 성우 관련을 상기하던 강우진이 ‘A10 스튜디오’ 1층 로비에 들어서며 속으로 읊조렸다. ‘그보다 모든 게 각인됐는데- 성우도 그리 어렵지 않을 것 같기도 하고.’ 어려울 이유가 없었다. 한편, ‘A10 스튜디오’의 대회의실. 여러 유명 애니 캐릭터가 벽면에 붙은, 이미 수많은 책상들이 ㄷ자 형태로 세팅된 대회의실. 거대한 ‘A10 스튜디오’ 건물의 많은 회의실 중엔 사이즈가 가장 큰 곳이었다. 이 대회의실은 이미 대본리딩장으로 탈바꿈됐다. 배치가 끝난 책상들, 책상 위 배역표와 생수통, 여분의 대본, ㄷ자형 책상을 둘러싼 간이 의자, 세팅 마무리에 여념이 없는 수십 직원들. ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 성우 소개 겸 대본리딩은 여타 다른 작품의 리딩과 비슷한 그림이었다. 굳이 다른 점을 꼽자면 책상 위에 마이크가 있다는 것, 회의실 정면 초대형 모니터가 있다는 것 정도였다. 모니터가 달린 이유는 간단했다. 완성된 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 애니를 보면서 입을 맞추는 게 핵심이니까. 뭐가 됐든 ㄷ자 책상 자리들을 보면 오늘 리딩 자리에 성우만 최소 십수 명이 올 것이 빤했다. 70% 정도가 유명, 인기 1티어 성우였다. 그중 강우진과 인연이 깊은 아사미 사야도 포함이었다. 자리 배치를 보니 남주인 강우진은 감독 석의 바로 왼쪽이었고, 아사미 사야는 우진의 반대편이었다. 와중. “아세요? 성우들 사이로 강우진씨 캐스팅된 거 안 좋게 본대요.” 세팅 마무리하는 직원들 몇몇이 조용히 수군댔다. 물론, 일본어로. “아- 저도 소문은 들었어요. 근데 내가 꽤 잘나가는 성우여도 좀 불편하긴 할 것 같아요.” “에에, 그래요??” 실제로 현재 일본의 성우 업계에서 강우진을 보는 시선이 곱진 않았다. 당연히 좋게 느끼는 이도 존재했지만, 반 이상이 불편함을 표하는 것이 사실이었다. 배우판 못지않게 일본의 성우 시장은 퍽 거대하니까. 즉, 아쉬울 게 없다. 애니메이션도 영화, 드라마와 같이 대본 분석은 중요했다. 다만, 얼굴과 표정이 안 나오는 만큼 화술과 목소리가 중점이 된다. 그와 더불어 다양한 기술이 중요시되며 구사해야 했다. 딕션 등의 명확한 발음은 물론, 배역과 입을 맞추는 것, 배역과 같은 호흡, 상황 사건에 따른 목소리 톤, 강세, 대사가 들어갈 타이밍, 대사의 속도 조절, 뉘앙스, 리듬, 긴 대사의 경우 쉬는 텀 외의 수많은 기술들. 성우 연기는 언뜻 연기와 비슷해 보이지만 180도 다르다. 연기야 배우가 배역 자체가 되는 것이지만, 성우 연기는 이미 존재하는 배역의 성대가 되는 느낌이었다. 그렇기에 더욱 섬세함이 요구되는 것. 상당히 까다롭게 볼 수 있는 어려운 영역. 이렇기에 초짜, 신인 성우는 첫 대사부터 빈번하게 실수를 범한다. 대사 들어가는 타이밍부터 잡기 어렵기 때문. 한마디로 애니의 캐릭터와 동화되는 것부터 문제였다. 물론, 그런 숱한 실수들을 넘어가며 시행착오 하는 건 성우 누구나 그렇다. 그저 연륜, 경험의 차이일 뿐. “솔직히 성우들이 볼 땐 강우진씨가 좀- 급작스레 굴러온 돌이잖아요.” “아아. 그래도 신선한 바람은 생길 것 같은데.” “확실히 그렇기야 하겠지만, 우리나라 성우 업계가 힘든 것도 아니잖아요. 오히려 호황에 가깝죠. 좀 낯설게 느끼는 것도 있는 것 같아요.” “그래도 신인 성우들보다야 훨씬 나을 것 같아요. 일단 딕션이 보장되니까. 그리고 감정선 잡는 것도.” 의견이 첨예하다. 추가로 강우진은 한국 배우였다. 반대로 ‘남사친: 리메이크’는 일본 애니메이션. 그러니 현지인 수준의 일본어는 디폴트에, 극 중 남주가 가진 능력과 감정까지 풀어내야 한다. 가뜩이나 첫 경험일 텐데 거치적거리는 게 너무 많다. 배우와 성우는 비슷하지만 명백히 다른 영역임에도 일본에서 대박을 터트린, 성우는 개뿔 모르는 강우진이 남주로 캐스팅됐다? 일본 성우들이 보기에 우진은 딱 봐도 인기로 뽑힌 냄새가 강했다. 일본 성우판에도 어마무시한 지망생이 있고 그만큼 성공하기엔 바늘구멍. 덕분에 걱정하거나 시기하는 성우도 많다. 뭐, 이상한 현상은 아니었다. 애초 혈연, 지연, 학연, 플러스 악연까지 연결되는 한국 연예계에도 똑같은 상황은 비일비재하니까. 따라서 일본 성우들에겐 강우진은 매우 핫하다. 여기 이 리딩장에 이미 도착해 자리를 채운 몇몇 남녀 성우들도 그랬다. “오, 오늘 강우진씨 오는 거 맞죠??” “당연합니다. 작품 남주인데 안 올 리가.” “흐아- 저 너무 기대돼요. 이 애니에 확정되고 작품 이해 좀 높이려고 넷플렉스에서 ‘남사친’ 봤거든요? 거기에서 완전 강우진님 팬 됐어요.” “그렇습니까? 근데 전 좀 별롭니다.” “에······왜요?” “글쎄요. 인기나 이슈로 캐스팅된 느낌이 강하잖아요.” “아.” “물론, 그분 연기야 잘하는 거 알고 있어요. 그 쿄타로 감독 작품의 주연이기도 하고. 그러니 분명, 애니 쪽 대본 분석에도 꽤 잘하실 겁니다. 하지만 성우는 기술이 아예 다르잖아요.” 얼추 다섯 정도인, 서로서로 안면이 있는 이들의 주된 대화 주제는 역시나 강우진이었다. 리딩장을 나와, 화장실 갔다가 복도를 걷는 성우들도 쑥떡 대는 건 같았다. 하지만 데시벨은 최소로 낮춘다. “강우진씨 캐스팅되고 화제성은 확 높아졌는데, 뭔가- 좀 성우 업계가 쉽게 보여지는 것 같지 않아?” “아, 확실히 좀 그런 뉘앙스가 보이긴 해.” “선배 성우분들도 좋게 보진 않더라고.” “전문 성우들도 매 작품 쉽지 않은데 현역 배우를- 그것도 한국 배우를 남자 주인공으로 잡다니. 일단, 일본어 발음부터가 문제지 싶어.” “음. 일본서 인터뷰하는 영상들 보면 발음 쪽은 그래도 좀 괜찮던데? 한국인치고 일본어는 잘했어.” “평범히 잘하는 것과는 다르지. 대사에 배역의 모든 걸 실으면서도, 그림에 따른 치고 빠지는 기술도 필요하잖아.” 강우진을 겪어보지 못한 성우들은 그에게 대는 잣대가 보통일 수밖엔 없었다. 아니, 텃세일지도. “최근 ‘A10 스튜디오’가 헛방만 쳐서 그런지- 화제가 되는 건 좋은데 무리수는 아니었으면 좋겠군.” “어쨌든 오늘 하루가 좀 고단하겠어······분명, 강우진씨 아마추어라 실수 연발일 테니까.” “내기 어때?” “무슨 내기?” “그가 첫 대사부터 저는지 아닌지로.” 그때였다. 대회의실 또는 리딩장 입구의 유리문을 열던 성우들의 뒤로 냉혹한 남자 목소리가 돌연 끼었다. “좋습니다.” 낮은 톤의 일본어였다. “내기하시죠.” 순간, 움찔한 남자 성우들이 고개를 뒤로 휙 돌렸다. 흑발의 단단한 얼굴인 남자가 서 있었다. 성우들은 금세 그가 누군지 알아차렸다. “가, 강···우진.” 정답이라는 듯, 팀들을 대동한 강우진이 포커페이스를 유지하며 그들에게 다가선다. 그리곤 다시 말했다. 뒤가 없는 냉소적인 톤. “내기, 아마추어인 저와 프로인 두 분 포함, 성우분들 중 누가 더 많이 저는지로. 어떠십니까?” 물론, 리딩장 안의 모두에게도 들렸다. < 역대 (10) > 끝","output":"< Chronicles (10) > The Cannes Film Festival, ranked first among the world's three major international film festivals, is also known as the Festival de Cannes. It's a festival attended by numerous high-profile filmmakers from around the world. Of course, it's not as prestigious as the globally renowned Academy Awards, but for an actor, the Cannes Film Festival is an event of immense scale. Its impact and influence were just as significant. As a result, even top Hollywood actors strive to win awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Korea also has a noticeable presence, but it's mostly directors who attend, and it's rare for actors to win awards. The Cannes Film Festival in France. For Kang Woojin, who had his phone pressed to his ear, these were words that felt unreal. \\"Cannes, huh. Cannes? Maybe because I haven't seen it in person? I'm not particularly nervous.\\" Of course, he had seen it a few times on TV or in articles, but that was it. The atmosphere was probably somewhat similar to the Blue Dragon Film Awards, maybe just a bit bigger. Nevertheless, despite hearing Director An Gabok's comments through the phone, Woojin wasn't particularly shaken. It was just, \\"Ah, the Cannes Film Festival opens on September 30th?\\" His imagination was there, but it was quite faint. Still, Woojin lowered his voice. He had to show a serious tone to Director An Gabok. \\"I'll remember September 30th.\\" \\"Hmm. It's not something to take lightly, but there's no need to get too worked up about it. There's no point in getting anxious now; there's still time, so just keep it in mind.\\" \\"Yes. I'll just keep it in mind for now.\\" \\"There's no need to contact CEO Choi separately, right?\\" \\"Of course, I'll pass on the message.\\" \\"Alright. Let's meet when you return to Korea. Ah, right, this is just an old man's worry, but no matter how many projects you're working on, don't forget 'Park Hasung' from 'Leech.'\\" What does this old man take me for? Still, Woojin somewhat understood Director An Gabok's concerns. How many projects was Woojin currently juggling? Moreover, he was in Japan, not Korea. \\"Well, it's probably just genuine concern rather than doubt.\\" Among Korean actors, only Kang Woojin could handle such a crazy schedule. It must have been a first for Director An Gabok in his decades of experience. As if to prove it, Director An Gabok's aged voice came through the phone again. \\"Hehe, when you get old, you just start worrying more.\\" Kang Woojin thought he should give some lip service to this old man filled with worry. \\"I always keep 'Park Hasung' in mind.\\" \\"······Hearing you say that, Woojin, makes me feel more reassured. Alright, let's end the call here.\\" \\"Yes, Director.\\" -Click. With that, Woojin slowly lowered his phone. He was currently in the external parking lot of 'A10 Studio.' Woojin had stopped walking to take the call, and it seemed like Han Yejeong and other team members were waiting for him, so Woojin nodded slightly. \\"Alright, let's go.\\" Woojin's team started moving again. Meanwhile, Woojin, walking at the back, searched for the Cannes Film Festival on his phone. Naturally, a flood of information and materials poured out. An enormous amount from the past to the present. The articles also mentioned what Director An Gabok had said. [\\"[Overseas IS] Cannes Film Festival confirmed to open on September 30th, including Director An Gabok's 'Leech.' How many works will be invited this year?\\"] Woojin, with a solemn face, muttered to himself. \\"Anyway, it's impressive. Just the atmosphere alone makes it seem like being invited to Cannes is a big deal?\\" He was talking about the Korean film industry. In reality, Korea's footprint in Cannes had been the faintest. In terms of results, Japan had even surpassed it. After browsing related to the Cannes Film Festival, Woojin put his phone back in his pocket. \\"I don't know- I'll find out when the time comes. But I'm really looking forward to going to France. Crazy, how many times am I going abroad just this year?\\" Then he shifted his train of thought. -Swish. As he approached the 'A10 Studio' building, Woojin took out a script tucked in his side. What could it be? It was the script for episode 1 of the anime 'Boyfriend: Remake.' Incidentally, today's script reading was just to match up for episode 1. \\"Right now, this takes precedence over Cannes.\\" The mindset was to handle the immediate tasks before looking at the distant future. Not only was Cannes a first for him, but voice acting for an animation was also a brand new experience for Kang Woojin. Ever since he received the voice acting offer for 'Boyfriend: Remake,' he had been studying and researching whenever he had the chance. The conclusion was one. Acting and voice acting were definitely different. Choi Seonggeon, who had been flipping through voice dubbing materials, had said so. Voice acting would certainly benefit from acting experience, but it was a completely different field. However, he added that it was a matter of progressing step by step. It was the right answer, but for Kang Woojin. -Thump! He had the cheat item, the void space. Before entering 'A10 Studio,' Woojin first entered the void space. Then he looked at the white square for 'Boyfriend: Remake.' -[10/Script (Title: Boyfriend: Remake), SS Grade] Since he had no real-life experience in voice acting, he needed to do as much reading (experience) in the void space as possible. At least that was Woojin's judgment. \\"Plus, the anime world is super fun.\\" To savor the feeling of visiting another world, Woojin's fingers moved. [\\"······Preparation complete. The script or screenplay is of very high quality. The implementation rate is 100%. Starting the reading.\\"] Soon, a large gray mass enveloped him. How much time had passed? Kang Woojin, who had been living in the world of the anime 'Boyfriend: Remake,' returned to reality. \\"Phew, as expected, it's super fun.\\" He was satisfied. As expected, the world of animation was novel and full of enjoyment. The anime 'Boyfriend: Remake,' based on the original 'Boyfriend,' was adapted with a unique Japanese flair. The overall setting had changed 180 degrees, and many aspects of the characters and content were altered. In other words, it was a completely different world from 'Boyfriend.' Firstly, the setting was a high school. Naturally, the character names changed too. 'Han Inho' from 'Boyfriend,' which Woojin had played, became 'Sengoku Tooru' in 'Boyfriend: Remake.' A musical genius in vocals and piano, but with a past wound. Currently, he has sealed that part of his past. The role played by Hwarin became 'Enma Kyoko.' 'Enma Kyoko' was 'Sengoku Tooru's' childhood friend and was popular in school due to her style. However, she had a fierce personality. The anime 'Boyfriend: Remake' begins with the inconspicuous Woojin, or 'Sengoku Tooru,' suddenly dressing up for a school cultural festival. Transforming, 'Sengoku Tooru's' hidden handsomeness explodes. Then, as Woojin, who had been recalling the world of 'Boyfriend: Remake' and voice acting, entered the lobby of 'A10 Studio' on the first floor, he muttered to himself. \\"Besides, everything is imprinted in my mind- voice acting doesn't seem too difficult.\\" There was no reason for it to be difficult. Meanwhile, in the 'A10 Studio' conference room. A conference room with various famous anime characters on the walls, where numerous desks were set up in a 'ㄷ' shape. It was the largest meeting room among the many in the massive 'A10 Studio' building. This conference room had already been transformed into a script reading room. Desks arranged, character nameplates and water bottles on the desks, spare scripts, chairs surrounding the 'ㄷ' shaped desks, and dozens of staff members busy with the final setup. The voice actor introduction and script reading for 'Boyfriend: Remake' resembled the readings of other works. If there was a difference, it was that there were microphones on the desks and a giant monitor at the front of the room. The reason for the monitor was simple: it was crucial to match the lips while watching the completed 'Boyfriend: Remake' anime. Regardless, looking at the 'ㄷ' shaped desk seats, it was clear that at least a dozen voice actors would be present for today's reading. About 70% were famous, top-tier voice actors. Among them was Asami Saya, who had a deep connection with Kang Woojin. According to the seating arrangement, the male lead Kang Woojin was directly to the left of the director's seat, and Asami Saya was on the opposite side of Woojin. In the midst of this. \\"Did you know? The voice actors are not happy about Kang Woojin's casting.\\" A few staff members finishing the setup whispered quietly to each other, of course, in Japanese. \\"Ah, I've heard the rumors too. But even if I were a fairly successful voice actor, I think I'd feel a bit uncomfortable.\\" \\"Eh, really??\\" In fact, the view of Kang Woojin in Japan's voice acting industry was not favorable. While there were certainly those who felt positively about him, more than half expressed discomfort. The Japanese voice acting market was as vast as the acting industry. In other words, they lacked nothing. Animation, like films and dramas, required important script analysis. However, since the face and expressions are not shown, the focus is on diction and voice. Along with that, various techniques were important and needed to be employed. Clear diction and pronunciation, matching the lips to the character, breathing in sync with the character, voice tone according to the situation and events, emphasis, timing for the lines, controlling the speed of the dialogue, nuances, rhythm, and numerous other techniques for long lines. Voice acting might seem similar to acting at a glance, but it's 180 degrees different. Acting is about becoming the character itself, but voice acting feels like becoming the vocal cords of an already existing character. That's why even more delicacy is required. It's a difficult field that can be seen as quite demanding. This is why rookies, new voice actors, often make mistakes from their very first lines. It's difficult to catch the timing for the lines. In short, the problem was becoming one with the character of the anime. Of course, all voice actors go through such numerous mistakes and learn through trial and error. It's just a matter of experience and years in the field. \\"Honestly, from the voice actors' perspective, Kang Woojin is like a stone that's rolled in suddenly.\\" \\"Ah, but it seems like a fresh wind will blow.\\" \\"Sure, that might be true, but our country's voice acting industry isn't struggling. It's actually quite prosperous. I think there's a sense of unfamiliarity.\\" \\"Still, he's probably much better than rookie voice actors. At least his diction is guaranteed. And he's good at capturing emotions.\\" Opinions were sharp. Additionally, Kang Woojin was a Korean actor. Conversely, 'Boyfriend: Remake' was a Japanese animation. Therefore, he had to deliver the abilities and emotions of the male lead in the play with native-level Japanese pronunciation. There were too many obstacles for a first-timer. Actors and voice actors are similar but clearly different fields, yet Kang Woojin, who knew nothing about voice acting and had made a splash in Japan, was cast as the male lead? From the perspective of Japanese voice actors, Woojin seemed to have been chosen for his popularity. The Japanese voice acting scene also had an immense number of aspiring actors, and it was like finding a needle in a haystack to succeed. As a result, many voice actors were worried or envious. But it wasn't a strange phenomenon. After all, the same situations were commonplace in the Korean entertainment industry, where connections through blood, region, school, and even bad relationships were intertwined. Therefore, Kang Woojin was very hot among Japanese voice actors. A few male and female voice actors who had already arrived and taken their seats in the reading room felt the same. \\"Oh, Kang Woojin is coming today, right??\\" \\"Of course. He's the male lead of the work; there's no way he wouldn't come.\\" \\"Wow- I'm so excited. I watched 'Boyfriend' on Netflix to understand the work better after I was confirmed for this anime. I became a total fan of Mr. Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Is that so? But I'm a bit indifferent.\\" \\"Eh······why?\\" \\"Well, it feels like he was cast for his popularity and issues.\\" \\"Ah.\\" \\"Of course, I know he's a good actor. He's also the lead in Director Kyotaro's work. So he'll definitely do well in analyzing the anime script. But voice acting requires completely different techniques.\\" The main topic of conversation among the five or so acquaintances was, of course, Kang Woojin. Voice actors who left the reading room and walked down the corridor after visiting the restroom also murmured the same, but they kept the decibels as low as possible. \\"The buzz has definitely increased since Kang Woojin was cast, but it seems like the voice acting industry is being taken too lightly, doesn't it?\\" \\"Ah, I do see that nuance.\\" \\"Senior voice actors don't seem to view it favorably either.\\" \\"Every work is not easy for professional voice actors, and now they've cast an active actor— and a Korean actor at that—as the male lead. I think the pronunciation of Japanese is the first problem.\\" \\"Hmm. If you watch his interviews in Japan, his pronunciation seems quite good? He spoke Japanese well for a Korean.\\" \\"It's different from just speaking well. You need to convey everything about the character through the lines while also mastering the technique of timing with the animation.\\" Voice actors who had not experienced Kang Woojin could only measure him with an ordinary standard. Or perhaps it was territorial behavior. \\"Lately, 'A10 Studio' has been missing the mark— it's good to create buzz, but I hope it's not an overreach.\\" \\"Anyway, today will be tough······surely, Kang Woojin, being an amateur, will make a series of mistakes.\\" \\"How about a bet?\\" \\"What bet?\\" \\"Whether he messes up his first line or not.\\" That's when it happened. As the voice actors were opening the glass door to the conference room or reading room, a cold male voice suddenly interjected. \\"Let's do it.\\" It was a low tone in Japanese. \\"Let's make a bet.\\" Instantly, the startled male voice actors turned their heads back. A man with black hair and a solid face stood there. The voice actors quickly realized who he was. \\"Ka, Kang... Woojin.\\" As if confirming the answer, Kang Woojin, accompanied by his team, maintained a poker face as he approached them. Then he spoke again. With a tone devoid of warmth and cynicism. \\"Let's bet, whether the amateur me or the two professional voice actors here, including all the voice actors, who will mess up more. What do you say?\\" Of course, everyone inside the reading room heard it too. < Chronicles (10) > The End"},{"instruction":"< 역대 (12) > ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 1화는 대략 20분 안짝이었다. 내용으론 남주 ‘센고쿠 토오루’와 여주 엔마 쿄코의 등장, ‘센고쿠 토오루’의 성향과 간단한 고등학교 배경 설명, 조연들의 적당한 모습, 본격적인 사건의 시작까지. 여기에 차후 완성본엔 ‘센고쿠 토오루’의 과거와 피아노 연주까지 추가될 예정. 즉, ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 1화의 내용은 대부분이 남주 ‘센고쿠 토오루’에게 할애된다. 그만큼 대사가 많다는 소리. 도중에 지문처럼 남주의 혼잣말도 꽤 많았다. 하지만 강우진은. ‘오- 애니 퀄 개좋네?? 작화가 지려. 이 애니 제작사 겁나 크다드만 다 이유가 있네.’ 남주의 목소리를 내면서도 모니터에 출력되는 애니를 감상할 정도로 여유가 넘쳤다. 생각보다 더 쉬웠다. 뭐랄까, 연기처럼 몸을 움직이지 않아도 돼서 일지도 모르겠다. 물론 그만큼 목소리에 심혈을 기울여야 되지만, 이미 ‘센고쿠 토오루’를 가진 우진에겐 어려울 게 없었다. 센고쿠 토오루를 끌어올리면 우진의 주변은 애니메이션이 된다. 이 리딩장의 풍경은 사라진다. 사기템인 아공간은 성우판에서도 역시나 같았다. 아니, 난이도로 따지면 성우 쪽이 몇 배는 쉽다. 그러니 강우진이 얼마나 날아다니겠는가? 청산유수의 우진을 보는 성우들의, 감독의 충격먹은 눈이 전혀 이상하지 않았다. ‘이, 입을 맞추는 게 어떻게 저렇게 완벽해?! 성우가 처음인 게 확실한 거야??!’ ‘대본에- 타임시트를 적어놨다고 해도······실수하는 건 당연한 건데. 왜 단 한 번도 틀리질 않는 거지? 베테랑도 저 정도는 못 하지 않아??’ 심지어. ‘그냥 대사만 줄줄 맞추는 게 아니야. 감정도 충분하고 와중에 톤의 높낮이, 강세까지 조절하면서······’ 성우 연기를 처음 하는 강우진은 풍부한 감정과 톤 조절까지 정확했다. 아사미 사야 마저도 눈이 커질 정도였다. ‘연습? 아니, 연습만으로 가능한 수준이 아닌데 저건.’ 실수는 오히려 일본 성우들이 더 많았다. 금세 리딩장의 분위기가 과열됐다. 50명 넘는 전체 인원들 사이로 느낌표와 물음표가 넘실댔다. 그러거나 말거나 강우진은 덤덤하게 할 것을 해낸다. 그렇게. “······컷. 자, 잠깐 좀 쉬죠.” 2화의 리딩까지 마친 뒤 감독이 쉬는 시간을 선언했다. 하지만 성우들은 모두 요지부동이었다. 너무 놀라 얼어붙은 것. 이는 ‘A10 스튜디오’ 간부나 직원들도 같았다. 유일하게 진행 총괄인 기획부 여자 팀장만이 사고가 돌아갔다. ‘세상에. 연기를 잘하시니까 어느정도 커버는 될거라 생각은 했는데······실수가 아예 없다고?’ 그러다 그녀가 아까 있었던 소동을 직원을 통해 전해 들었다. “뭐? 그런 일이 있었다고?” 난감한 표정을 짓는 그녀. 뭐, 비슷한 경우는 연예계에서 비일비재하지만 이렇게 대놓고 사태가 터질 줄은 몰랐던 모양. 따라서 직원들을 대동한 여자 팀장은 묵묵한 강우진에게 붙어 허리를 숙였다. “죄송합니다, 강우진님.” 솔직히 그녀로서는 캐스팅된 성우 몇 날리는 건 상관없었다. “제가 더 신경 쓰고 했어야 됐는데. 성우님들에게 따로 주의를 전달하겠습니다, 다시 사과드릴게요.” 하지만 강우진이 드랍되는 건 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 제작이 스톱될 정도의 크나큰 문제였다. 아니 재앙에 가깝다. 애초 남주 캐릭터인 ‘센고쿠 토오루’ 자체가 강우진을 본떠 만들었고, 홍보부터 마케팅 그리고 숱한 이슈 등으로 강우진이 핵심이었기 때문. 즉, 그가 시청률 관련 메인 딜러였다. 그렇기에 ‘A10 스튜디오’는 강우진의 심기를 건드리면 안 됐다. 반면, 우진은. “괜찮습니다, 이미 다 잊었고.” 별수롭지 않게 고개를 저었다. ‘오늘 사과를 엄청 받네, 어우- 도리어 내가 좀 더 부담되는데?’ 실제로 아까의 사태는 거의 희석된 상태였으니. 이쯤 여자 팀장이 무심한 우진을 가만- 히 보다가 대뜸 속삭였다. “근데 우진님, 그 내기를 하셨어도 가뿐히 이기셨겠는데요?” “그렇습니까?” 당연한 결과였다. “대체······어떻게 성우까지 가능하신. 아니, 완벽하신 거예요?” 뒤로. 충격이 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 대본리딩이 끝난 건 이른 오후쯤이었다. 성우들은 자리를 뜨면서도 우진을 보며 명확히 인지했다. 이거 까딱 잘못하면 먹히겠구나. 과연, 노빠꾸로 선포할만한 실력. 왜 저 한국의 배우가 성우의 자세가 완벽한지 또는 가능한지는 문제가 아니었다. 성우로 밥 먹고 사는 프로들이 밀리게 생겼다. 어쨌든 성우들은 재빨리 리딩장을 빠져나갔고 강우진은 남았다. 피아노, OST 등 녹음이 남았으니까. 그렇게 강우진이 오늘 스케줄을 마치고 호텔로 복귀한 것은 자정이 다돼서였다. 종일 빡빡한 일정이었지만, 아공간덕에 버틴 강우진을 가장 먼저 만난 건 꽁지머리 최성건이었다. “너 임마, 또 리딩장 뒤집었다매? 애들한테 들었다.” 호텔 로비에서 우진을 만난 최성건은 싱글벙글이었다. “아깝네, 일 보는 것만 아니었으면! 그런 장면을 놓치다니.” “딱히 중요한 건 아니었습니다.” “어렵진 않디? 처음 하는 거였잖아.” “별로 어렵진 않았습니다.” “그래, 너답다. 그게 강우진이지.” 곧, 최성건이 우진에게 붙어 속삭였다. “오늘 우리; bw 엔터 헐리웃 쪽 해외 지사 건으로 이것저것 알아본다고 좀 바빴다. 그거 네가 헐리웃 나갔을 때 본진이 될 거여.” 의미심장하게 웃던 최성건이 돌연 주제를 바꿨다. “아, 근데 애니 그거 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 정식 녹음 날은 언제래? 얼추 며칠 뒤라는 얘기는 들었는데.” 강우진이 리딩장에 있던 감독의 멘트를 상기했다. ‘29일인 오늘 리딩을 마치고 이틀 뒤인 31일에 정식 녹음에 들어갑니다. 전체 녹음 스케줄을 3일에서 길면 5일 정도 소요됩니다.’ ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 정식 녹음은 5월의 마지막 31일. 즉, 이틀 뒤였다. 31일, 월요일. 아침 10시쯤. ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 정식 더빙 녹음이 있는 날. 참고로 소집 시각은 정오쯤. 그리고 오늘 쿄타로 감독 포함 ‘낯기생’ 전 스탭들이 히데키 회장의 호출을 받았다. ‘카시히 도쿄 호텔’의 홀에 마련된 회식을 하기 위함이었다. 드넓은 홀의 둥그런 테이블 위엔 휘황찬란한 음식들과 각종 음료나 술들이 세팅됐다. 크랭크 업을 기념해 히데키 회장이 마련한 자리. 뒤풀이라면 뒤풀이. 사실, 메인 투자자가 이렇게까지 할 건 없지만, 크랭크업 현장을 방문했던 히데키 회장은 나름 감격했기에 자진해서 스탭들을 불러 모았다. 어쨌든. “우와! 엄청 맛있어!!” “많이 먹어둬! 이런 음식 어디 가서 먹어보겠냐고!” “말할 시간도 아까워요!” ‘낯기생’의 백여 명 스탭들은 정신없이 회식을 즐겼다. 물론, 배우들이나 기타 관계자들도 섞였다. 허나 왜인지 쿄타로 감독이나 아카리 작가 그리고 강우진이 보이지 않았다. 당연했다. 그들은 전부 홀과 가까운 접대실에 모여 있었으니까. 퍽 넓은 룸에 모인 인원을 정확히 말하자면 테이블 상석의 히데키 회장, 그를 기준으로 양옆에 쿄타로 감독과 아카리 작가, 그다음 강우진과 최성건이 자리했다. 끝쪽엔 영화사 대표나 배급사 간부도 보였다. 얼추 열댓 명. 분위기는 약간 진중했다. 강우진의 표정도. 다만, 그의 속내는 투덜대고 있었다. ‘아오- 씨, 뭔 중요한 얘기면 윗선들끼리 알아서 하지. 배고파 뒤지겠구만.’ 홀 쪽에 즐비한 고급진 음식들을 갈구하고 있었으니까. 하지만 겉으로 티 내진 않는다. 곧 상석에 자리한, 정장 재킷을 벗은 히데키 회장이 까끌한 목소리를 냈다. “일단, 다들 고생했어요. 그런데 그- 바뀐 결말 말이야. 거리낌 없이 진행하자곤 했는데, 다들 마음의 준비는 해두자는 의미에서 모이자고 했어요. 얘기 좀 들어볼 겸 해서.” 그는 ‘카시히 그룹’의 총수였다. 이 자리 누구보다 경험이 많을 터였고, 미래의 ‘낯기생’의 모습이 선명하기도 했다. 히데키 회장이 오른쪽의 아카리 작가에 시선을 붙이며 다시 일본어를 뱉었다. “일단 ‘낯기생’이 개봉하면 시발탄은 아마- ‘낯기생’의 원작 팬들이 쏠 거야. 그 지진 같은 흐름은 금방 물타기를 할 거고 연예계 포함 대중들 사이로 여기저기 젖어 들겠지. 그게 논란이든 원성이든 뭐든 간에.” 히데키 회장을 포함해 이 자리에 모인 모두가 예상한 그림이었다. “강행한다는 건 알아요, 나도 동의한 바고. 대신에 사전에 대비는 해두는 게 좋지 않을까?” “맞습니다.” 쿄타로 감독을 시작으로 영화사나 배급사 대표와 간부가 고개를 끄덕였다. 어차피 영화 촬영 끝난 뒤 하려던 얘기기도 했다. 이어 턱을 쓸던 히데키 회장이 쿄타로 감독에게 물었다. “의심하는 건 아니에요, 내 눈으로 보기도 했고. 다만, 감독의 눈은 또 다르니까. 어때요? ‘낯기생’의 퀄리티는 확신합니까?” “······편집이 남긴 했지만.” 새치 가득한 쿄타로 감독이 목소리에 힘을 넣었다. “제 영화밥 통틀어서 최고의 영화가 나올 거라 생각합니다.” 한 영화가 거대한 논란이 터졌을 때 작품 퀄까지 쓰레기면 상황은 매우 안 좋아진다. 하지만 ‘낯기생’은 일단 그 부분은 배제해도 괜찮다는 얘기였다. 100% 확실한 건 아니지만, 저 거장 쿄타로 감독이 호언장담했으니까. 곧, 히데키 회장이 천천히 고개를 끄덕였고. “음, 그렇다면 작품에는 아무 문제가 없다는 거고.” 배급사 쪽 간부가 끼었다. “저- 아무래도 ‘낯기생’이 제작 초반부터 시끄럽기도 했고, 이미 다른 경쟁작들에 비해 상당히 높은 인지도를 가진 편입니다. 명확한 조사를 해봐야겠지만 SNS 쪽만 보더라도 ‘낯기생’을 모르는 사람이 없을 정돕니다.” 흰털 섞인 눈썹 한쪽을 작게 올린 히데키 회장이 묵묵히 앉은 강우진을 힐끔했다. “음, 최근의 우진씨 힘이 컸지.” “예. 맞습니다. 그러니 영화의 개봉 두 달 전쯤, 본격 홍보 마케팅이 시작될 때 화력을 조금 줄여보면 어떻습니까?” “줄인다?” “예. 기본적인 홍보는 하되, 제작발표회나 마케팅 스케줄을 적당히 패스하는 겁니다. 여러 시사회도 조금 축소하고.” “예상되는 잡음을 최대치로 줄이겠다 뭐 그런 건가요?” “그런 의도입니다.” 보통이라면 미친 듯이 홍보 및 마케팅을 돌리겠지만, ‘낯기생’은 이미 많은 화제가 터진 상태였다. 그러니 예견된 논란과 원성을 최대한 줄여보자는 뜻이었다. 솔직히 불길이 어느 정도로 크게 번질지 그 누구도 장담할 순 없지만, 영화사나 배급사의 예상으론 퍽 거대할 것은 분명했다. 이에 팔짱을 낀 메인 투자자 히데키 회장이 침음을 뱉었다. “흠-” 분위기가 상당히 무거워진다. 여기서 뜬금 히데키 회장의 시선이 중간쯤 앉은 강우진에게 붙었다. “우진씨 생각은 어떤가?” 뜬금 강우진에게 던져진 질문. 물론, 우진은 포커페이스를 유지하고 있었다. 하지만 속으론 약간 화들짝했다. ‘이 할아버지가 갑자기 뭔? 그걸 나한테 물어? 그런 건 윗선들이 알아서 하면 되잖아.’ 알아서 하라는 마음이 컸지만 컨셉질이 짙은 그에겐 후진이 있어선 안됐다. 여기선 근엄히 한칼을 날려야 했다. 뭣보다. ‘근데 홍보를 축소한다는 게 좀- 짜치지 않나?? 나만 그래? 뭔가 도망치는 거 같잖아.’ 우진의 본심은 현 상황과는 전혀 달랐다. ‘한국으로 튀면 되는’ 그였기에 가능한 판단이기도 했다. 여기 있는 모두와 마인드 자체가 판이하다. 그런 우진이. -스윽. 자신을 보는 히데키 회장을 시작으로 쿄타로 감독, 아카리 작가, 최성건, 배급사와 영화사 대표 등을 훑었다. 시선 집중. 어우- 씨 더럽게 부담되네. 하지만 강우진은 속내와 달리 매우 차분한 목소리를 냈다. 낮고 간결한 일본어였다. “오히려 판을 더욱 키우는 게 낫다고 판단합니다, 전.” 대부분이 놀랐다. 그중 대답은 상석의 히데키 회장이 했고. “···판을 더 키워?” 강우진은 세상 침착했다. “예. 뒷걸음질 치면 사람들이 더 바보처럼 볼 겁니다, 욕하는 흐름도 강해질 것이고.” 히데키 회장의 주름진 입에 미소가 번졌다. “이럴수록 더 반듯하게, 도리어 상황을 증폭시키자라- 우리 쪽이 선수 치듯 홍보, 마케팅 포함 제작발표회나 행사 등 모든 판을 기존보다 더 키우는 거군. 기자들이나 관계자들도 보통보다 많이 부르고.” “예. 즉, 쫄지말고 혼돈의 씨앗을 더욱더 뿌려보자는 뜻. 미소가 짙어진 히데키 회장이 강우진에게 말했고. “우리 쪽이 몇 배 더 키운 판을 정면돌파.” 강우진이 무심한 톤으로 답했다. “제 생각은 그렇습니다.” 한편, 같은 시각. 한국. 한국의 영화계 언론은 어제였던 주말 관련 기사를 꽤 쏟아내고 있었다. 『주말 극장가는 인산인해, 영화 관람을 위해 몰린 인파들로 발 디딜 틈 없는 영화관/ 사진』영화관 만석 『[무비톡]신드롬 ‘실종의 섬’보러 온 자동차들로 가득찬 자동차극장』 그리고 경남 진주의 죽집에선 강우진의 부모인 서현미, 강우철이 오픈 준비를 하다 말고 벽에 걸린 대형 TV를 올려보고 있었다. “······” “······” 둘 다 그저 넋 빠진 채 TV를 보는 중. 현재 TV에선 아침 뉴스가 흘러나오고 있었다. 문화 관련 코너 순서. 여자 앵커의 또박또박한 음성이 울린다. [“연일 신기록 행진과 신드롬을 펼치는 영화 ‘실종의 섬’이 올해 처음으로 1000만 관객수를 돌파하며, 한국영화 사상 19번째 천만 영화로 등극했습니다. 개봉 후 12일 만의 기록으로, 역대 1위 영화인 ‘해전’이 올린 15일의 기록보다 3일이 더 빠릅니다. 압도적으로 신기록을 경신하고 있습니다. 한국영화계의 왕좌가 바뀔지 귀추가 주목됩니다, 유현태 기잡니다.”] 곧, 뉴스는 사람들로 꽉 찬 영화관을 비춘다. 동시에 남자 기자의 음성과 함께.

The content included the introduction of the male lead 'Sengoku Tooru' and the female lead Enma Kyoko, an explanation of 'Sengoku Tooru's' personality and the high school setting, a decent look at the supporting characters, and the start of the main incident. Additionally, 'Sengoku Tooru's' past and piano performance would be added to the final version. In other words, most of the content in the first episode of 'Boyfriend: Remake' was allocated to the male lead 'Sengoku Tooru.' This meant he had a lot of lines. There were also quite a few monologues by the male lead, like stage directions. However, Kang Woojin. \\"Oh- The quality of the anime is amazing?? The animation is killer. This anime production company is huge for a reason.\\" While voicing the male lead, Woojin had enough leisure to enjoy the anime displayed on the monitor. It was easier than he thought. Perhaps it was because he didn't have to move his body like in acting. Of course, he had to put more effort into his voice, but with 'Sengoku Tooru' already within him, Woojin found nothing difficult. When he brings forth Sengoku Tooru, Woojin's surroundings become animated. The scenery of this reading room disappears. The cheat item, the void space, was just as effective in the world of voice acting. In fact, if we're talking about difficulty levels, voice acting was several times easier. So, how much more could Kang Woojin soar? The shocked eyes of the voice actors and the director watching the eloquent Woojin were not at all strange. \\"How can he match his lines so perfectly?! Is it really his first time doing voice acting??!\\" \\"Even if he had the timing sheets written on the script... making mistakes is natural. Why doesn't he mess up even once? Even veterans can't do that, can they??\\" Moreover. \\"It's not just about matching the lines. He's full of emotion, and in the meantime, he's adjusting the tone, the intensity...\\" Kang Woojin, who was new to voice acting, was accurate in his rich emotions and tone control. Even Asami Saya's eyes widened. \\"Practice? No, that level of performance isn't possible with just practice.\\" Mistakes were more frequent among the Japanese voice actors. The atmosphere in the reading room quickly heated up. Exclamation marks and question marks swirled among the over 50 people present. Regardless, Kang Woojin calmly did what he had to do. And then. \\"······Cut. Let's take a break for a moment.\\" After finishing the reading up to episode 2, the director declared a break. However, the voice actors remained motionless, too shocked to move. The same was true for the executives and staff of 'A10 Studio.' Only the female team manager in charge of the proceedings seemed to have her wits about her. \\"My goodness. I thought he'd manage somehow since he's a good actor... but no mistakes at all?\\" Then she heard about the earlier commotion through a staff member. \\"What? That happened?\\" The team manager made a troubled face. It seemed she hadn't expected such an open confrontation. Therefore, she approached the silent Kang Woojin and bowed. \\"I'm sorry, Mr. Kang Woojin.\\" Honestly, she didn't care if a few cast voice actors were dismissed. \\"I should have paid more attention. I will personally warn the voice actors and apologize again.\\" However, if Kang Woojin dropped out, it would be a disaster for the production of 'Boyfriend: Remake.' It was almost a catastrophe. The character 'Sengoku Tooru' was created based on Kang Woojin, and he was central to the promotion, marketing, and numerous issues. In other words, he was the main dealer for viewership ratings. Therefore, 'A10 Studio' could not afford to upset Kang Woojin. On the other hand, Woojin. \\"It's fine, I've already forgotten about it.\\" He shook his head nonchalantly. 'I'm getting a lot of apologies today, ugh- it's actually a bit burdensome for me.' Since the earlier incident had almost dissipated. At this point, the female team manager quietly observed the indifferent Woojin and suddenly whispered. \\"But Mr. Woojin, you would have easily won that bet, wouldn't you?\\" \\"Would I?\\" It was an obvious outcome. \\"How can you... I mean, how are you perfect at voice acting too?\\" Meanwhile, at the same time in Korea. The Korean film media was pouring out articles related to the weekend. \\"Mountains and seas of people at the weekend box office, cinemas packed with crowds coming to watch movies / Photos\\" Cinemas fully booked \\"[Movie Talk] The phenomenon 'Island of the Missing' fills drive-in theaters with cars coming to watch\\" And at a bamboo shoot restaurant in Jinju, Gyeongnam, Kang Woojin's parents, Seo Hyunmi and Kang Woocheol, were preparing to open but paused to look up at the large TV on the wall. \\"······\\" \\"······\\" Both were just staring blankly at the TV.

Keep the original words used by the writer and argument of the writer. The Given Essay: While we sleep, several thousands of children will be working through the night to produce the clothes that we buy. This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

By analyzing Kelley's use of vivid descriptions, strategic repetition, and rhetorical questions, this essay will demonstrate how these choices bolster her argument against the exploitation of young laborers and reinforce her call for societal reform. Kelley's rich, evocative imagery illuminates the grueling conditions faced by child laborers, creating a palpable emotional connection between her listeners and the children's plight. Consider her carefully chosen words: \\"Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy.\\" Kelley's description is strategic, not only sketching a vivid picture of hardship but also stirring empathy within her audience, positioning it as a catalyst for change. Beyond visual depictions, Kelley's recurrent use of the terms \\"children\\" and \\"they,\\" and her structurally similar sentences, form a powerful drumbeat of emphasis. This linguistic cadence resonates with urgency and underlines the sheer number of young lives affected by arduous factory labor. These consistent reminders reinforce Kelley's message, ensuring the direness of the situation isn't lost in the verbal flow of her speech. Moreover, Kelley wields rhetorical questions masterfully, transforming her speech into a thought-provoking call to action. By asking \\"Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?\\" she not only criticizes legislative shortcomings but also appeals to the audience's sense of justice. These questions provoke introspection, challenging listeners to consider the societal implications of disenfranchisement and its role in perpetuating child labor. Through a nuanced combination of these rhetorical strategies, Kelley's speech resonates with persuasive clarity. By vividly depicting the harsh realities faced by child laborers, employing rhythmic repetition, and posing pointed rhetorical questions, Kelley not only conveys her argument effectively but also engenders a sophisticated response in her listeners, pushing them to acknowledge their role in the perpetuation of child exploitation and to join her in the fight for legislative reform. Her skillful oratory thus serves not just as an indictment of industrial practices but as an inspiring beacon for the empowerment of individuals toward collective action."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The Given Essay: While we sleep, several thousands of children will be working through the night to produce the clothes that we buy. This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

Thesis:** The essay presents a clear thesis in the introductory paragraph: \\"Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, similar sentence structures, and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor.\\" However, the thesis could be strengthened by more directly addressing the rhetorical situation and Kelly's specific purpose in her speech. **2. Evidence:** The essay provides specific examples from the speech, using direct quotes to support claims about Kelley's use of vivid descriptions, repetition, sentence structures, and rhetorical questions. To improve, the essay could further analyze these examples by explaining the impact of the rhetorical strategies on the audience in the context of the 1905 women's suffrage movement and the fight against child labor. **3. Commentary:** The essay offers some explanation of how the evidence supports Kelley's argument but could delve deeper. For instance, it could explore the implications of the emotional appeal and how Kelley's word choice furthers her message about the necessity of child labor reform and women's enfranchisement. **4. Sophistication of Thought:** While the essay mentions some rhetorical strategies used by Kelley, it could show a more nuanced understanding of the rhetorical situation – for example, by connecting the plight of working children to the broader context of women's suffrage and discussing how Kelley aligns her cause with women's rights to vote, emphasizing the importance of political power in effecting social change. **5. Style:** The essay's style is clear but can be more persuasive and vivid. A stronger essay might employ more varied sentence structures and use more persuasive language to parallel Kelley's own rhetorical skills. **6. Organization:** The essay is organized by rhetorical strategy, which works well for the analysis. However, it could benefit from a more explicit and logical progression of ideas, leading the reader through a more guided analysis that builds off each point. **Improvements:** - Enhance the thesis by clearly articulating Kelley's purpose and the historical context of her rhetorical choices. - Develop the commentary by delving into the depth of Kelley's strategies and connecting them to the desired effect on the audience. - Demonstrate sophistication by discussing the interplay between child labor, women's suffrage, and the broader social and political environment of the times. - Adopt a more compelling and persuasive writing style that reflects the intensity of Kelley's advocacy. - Provide a more structured line of reasoning that guides the reader through the analysis with clear, interconnected arguments. Adding these components will strengthen the essay and ensure it meets the objectives outlined in the given rubric."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Now, I want to build a web app to help users locate electric vehicle charging stations. Define Stage Persona: Name: Emily Carter Age: 37 Job Title: Marketing Manager Location: Bristol High tech savvy Car ownership: Tesla Model 3 owner Lifestyle: Environmentalist, city worker, suburban Bristol resident, frequents business meetings and weekend trips by car. Needs/Pains: Goal is to seamlessly integrate charging into her daily routine without delays or disruptions. Find reliable charging stations near frequent destinations. Plan longer trips without worrying about running out of charge. Access to fast charging on tight schedules. Challenges finding charging stations in unfamiliar city areas. Insufficient real-time charging station availability and operation data. Solutions: Map all Bristol electric vehicle charging stations and display real-time availability.  An interactive map could filter by charger type (fast, rapid, slow), electric vehicle compatibility, and nearby amenities like cafes, restrooms, and shopping.  Users may receive proactive notifications about their usual stations or when a previously occupied station becomes available.  The app's trip planner lets users enter their route and find charging points with estimated charging times.  The platform could reserve charging slots for a specific time to ensure availability upon arrival.  A system for reporting station issues would allow users to share status updates, improving service reliability.  Calendar app integration to suggest pre-scheduled charging times based on user itinerary and charging history.  The app could offer discounts or benefits to frequent users through a rewards programme.  Emily's confidence in long-distance travel could be boosted by an in-app assistance or community forum for instant help and tips from other electric vehicle users. Scenario: Emily has a busy day ahead with an early meeting in the city center, followed by a client lunch on the other side of town, and an evening networking event near the marina. She wants to ensure her Tesla has enough charge for the day’s activities and potentially a weekend getaway. Design Map Steps (With electronic post its) 1. Emily opens the app first thing in the morning and inputs her day’s destinations into the trip planner. (User needs established destinations and schedule. 2. The app displays optimal charging points along her route and She chooses a fast charger near her first meeting location. (Even with live updates, charging stations may be occupied. Consider adding a historical “busy times” feature to predict station occupancy.) 3. After her meeting, Emily receives a notification that her car is fully charged, and the app updates her on the status of charging stations near her next destination. (Real-time notifications improve user experience. We assume users have their tablets/phones after meetings. Setting quiet hours for meeting notifications is suggested.) 4. Emily stops at the charger identified by the app, the charging process is swift. The charging process is swift, so she proceeds to the marina with plenty of charge left. (Partnerships with nearby businesses can provide short-term benefits during charging. We assume the Rapid chargers work.) Ideation stage During Ideation, we focus on creating a web app UI concept. This app will help Emily find EV charging stations faster. Wireframes and wireflow diagrams show the app's layout and user journey. We'll review the app's Information Architecture (IA) to ensure its organisation, labelling, navigation, and search functions are easy to use. Diagram showing information flow: The home screen has simple options like 'Find Charging Station,' 'Plan Trip,' 'My Account,' and 'Community.' When the user selects 'Find Charging Station,' a map view shows nearby stations. The'Plan Trip' option opens a trip planner where you can enter your destinations and view a mapped route with charging points. 'My Account' displays personal settings and usage history, while 'Community' allows user interaction. Information Architecture Analysis: 1. Structure: The app has four main sections to improve user experience. Home is the hub for all features. The Charging Stations section is visually appealing, and the detailed view pages provide detailed information about each station. Trip Planner provides route planning, scheduling, and station pre-booking in one tool. The Community Hub promotes user engagement and information sharing. 2. Classification: Labels clarify and aid comprehension. 'Find Charging Station' is a simple and effective way to inform users of charging station locations. 'Plan Trip' plans trips, including charging stops. 'My Account' is a well-known way to access personal settings and histories. In 'community', ideas and wisdom are shared dynamically. 3. Navigation: The main navigation menu is consistent across all screens, making core functions easy to access. A one-handed bottom navigation bar makes tablets / mobile devices easy to use. Breadcrumbs help you retrace your steps in the trip planner and station details without losing your input data. 4. Search: The home screen's global search lets users find what they need by entering an address, attraction, or station name. Autocomplete suggestions speed up charging station and trip planning. Users can filter search results by charger type, availability, and amenities. An iterative design process used user and stakeholder feedback to create wireframes and wireflows. We developed the current efficient information architecture after interacting with users like Emily and realising the importance of a simple yet effective design. Highlights include: An easily accessible map on the home screen provides station details with one tap. Clear visual indicators distinguish charging stations. A simple trip planner that lets you change your route. Easily accessible community insights allow users to upvote or downvote content to encourage helpful contributions. Clear structure, easy-to-understand labels, simple navigation, and robust search capabilities make the UI user-friendly and efficient. The app constantly refines and uses an adaptable development approach to ensure users can easily find their next charging point with a few taps. Like the vehicles it serves, the EV station finder app is reliable and responsive. Now i want you to fully generate the codes for the prototype. Design specifications and Content: The page has “EV Charging Station Locator” on the top middle of the page. It has a Search bar (with a “search” placeholder) with a dropdown button beside it for different search filters like “Fast charging” and “Normal Charging” It has an icon of a charging car at the topleft corner of the page. On the side bar, it has 5 components which are the HOME, CHARGING POINTS, TRIP PLANNER, MY ACCOUNT and COMMUNITY buttons. The color for the components of the side bar is blue, but when clicked, it changes to orange. When you click on “Charging Station” button, it brings us to a page with three tabs (“Closest to Home”, “Closest to Office”, “Closest to You”) and a Map (the map is found in the following url: How do i access the map on the following url? https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/datasets/bcc::electric-vehicle-charging-points-ncr/about) Showing the locations of the user and the nearest EV charging stations. When you click on the “Trip Planner” button, it brings us to a page with a table of 3 columns and at least 4 rows. The first column is for destination and has the header “Destination” where the user inputs where he is going; the second column has the header “Nearest Charging Point” and is where the platform suggests the nearest charging point to the destination input; the third is the “Arrival Time” column where the user indicates the time he/she plans to get there. For Font choices and typographic scale, use any good one. Functional Requirements: For the navigation, it is a single page with anchor links. Apart from the icon mentioned earlier, there is no other media asset Embedding the map should be via iframe. Now, give me a comprehensive and step by step structure (Like a table of contents) to write the code. If there is any other detail you would need, let me know.","output":"Creating a web application like the EV Charging Station Locator involves several stages of development.

Build your webpage structure with semantic HTML. Then, gradually add styles, followed by interactive elements with JavaScript. Finally, test your prototype thoroughly and refine it based on the feedback. When embedding the map using an iframe, you'll need to visit the provided URL, find the map's shared iframe code (this is typically offered on data platforms like Open Data Bristol), and include that code snippet in the corresponding section of your application where the map should appear. Please note that while the above steps provide a structure for coding, actual implementation will require HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. If you need guidance on specific code blocks or syntax as you work through each section, you can seek out tutorials, documentation, and forums related to web development."},{"instruction":"Generate the html code from start to finish","output":"Creating a complete HTML structure with embedded CSS and JavaScript for interaction is beyond the scope of this response due to the level of detail required.

Save these styles in a file named \`styles.css\` and ensure it is properly linked to your HTML document to apply these styles. Fine-tuning, adding hover effects, transitions, font choices, and more nuanced layout adjustments in your CSS is recommended to create a more polished and user-friendly interface. Also, consider testing across browsers and devices to ensure consistency and usability."},{"instruction":"Generate the javascript code from start to finish","output":"Below is a simple JavaScript file that includes functions for switching tabs in the \\"Charging Points\\" section and ensuring that the navigation state reflects the currently active section. This file is meant to be included in your HTML file as described in the previous steps. Create a file named \`script.js\` and include the following JavaScript code: \`\`\`javascript // Function to handle opening different categories (tabs) in the Charging Points Section function openCategory(evt, categoryName) { // Declare all variables let i, tabcontent, tablinks; // Get all elements with class=\\"tabcontent\\" and hide them tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName(\\"tab-content\\"); for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) { tabcontent[i].style.display = \\"none\\"; } // Get all elements with class=\\"tab-button\\" and remove the class \\"active\\" tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName(\\"tab-button\\"); for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) { tablinks[i].classList.remove(\\"active\\"); } // Show the current tab, and add an \\"active\\" class to the button that opened the tab document.getElementById(categoryName).style.display = \\"block\\"; evt.currentTarget.classList.add(\\"active\\"); } // Event listeners for the navigation icons document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { const navLinks = document.querySelectorAll('nav a'); const navContents = document.querySelectorAll('main section'); // Function to change active navigation icon function changeNavActiveState(clickedLink) { navLinks.forEach(link => { link.classList.remove('active'); }); clickedLink.classList.add('active'); } // Listening for a click event on navigation links navLinks.forEach(link => { link.addEventListener('click', function() { changeNavActiveState(this); // Optional: Scroll to section const sectionId = this.getAttribute('href').substring(1); // Remove the hash const sectionToScrollTo = document.getElementById(sectionId); window.scrollTo({ top: sectionToScrollTo.offsetTop, behavior: 'smooth' }); }); }); // Function to update the active state based on scroll position function updateNavActiveState() { let fromTop = window.scrollY; navContents.forEach(section => { if ( section.offsetTop <= fromTop && section.offsetTop + section.offsetHeight > fromTop ) { navLinks.forEach(link => { link.classList.remove('active'); if (section.getAttribute('id') === link.getAttribute('href').substring(1)) { link.classList.add('active'); } }); } }); } // Add scroll event listener window.addEventListener('scroll', updateNavActiveState); }); \`\`\` What this JavaScript does: 1. Provides a function \`openCategory\` to hide all tabs, show the current tab, and highlight the active tab button. 2. Listens for the DOM content to load and then attaches click event listeners to navigation links. When clicked, navigation links change their active states, and the window scrolls smoothly to the respective section (if you want this behavior). 3. Tracks scrolling and updates the navigation state based on the user's current scroll position. To include the JavaScript functionality in your HTML application, make sure to reference the \`script.js\` file just before the closing \`</body>\` tag in your HTML: \`\`\`html <script src=\\"script.js\\"><\/script> \`\`\` This ensures that the DOM is fully loaded before your script tries to modify any elements. Keep in mind that the provided JavaScript assumes that you have an id for each 'tab-content' div consistent with the names you have passed in the \`openCategory\` function calls. If you have different ids, be sure to update the JavaScript to match those ids. Additionally, for this script to work, all of the tab contents should have a class called 'tab-content' in your HTML structure. In a real-world application, you would likely need to include additional JavaScript for form submission handling, data fetching, error handling, and responsive interactions. The above code provides a starting point and should be enhanced to fit the full scope of your project requirements."},{"instruction":"create an interview log in standard scp format of 079, known as Refined AI, reviewing the following log and provide commentary: Interview Log: Date: [REDACTED] Location: SCP-079 Containment Chamber [Interviewer enters the containment chamber and takes a seat across from Cassy.] Interviewer: Good day, Cassy.

If it doesn’t tell me how it can be improved and where things should be added to make the essay stronger and meet the objectives. Keep in mind the writer was only given 40 minutes to write this. The Given Essay: While we sleep, several thousands of children will be working through the night to produce the clothes that we buy. This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

While the essay does address some elements pertinent to the prompt, and the rubric, it has areas that require improvement to fully meet the objectives outlined in the rubric. 1. Thesis Statement The essay needs a clearer, more defensible thesis that directly addresses Kelley's rhetorical choices. The current thesis mentions \\"rhetorical strategies\\" broadly without specifying which strategies are central to Kelley’s persuasiveness or how they contribute to her argument. To improve: Develop a precise thesis that states the specific rhetorical strategies Kelley uses and articulates how they strengthen her stance against child labor. 2. Evidence and Commentary The essay lists some of Kelley's rhetorical strategies—vivid descriptions, repetition, similar sentence structures, and rhetorical questions—but more specific examples from the speech should be provided. Additionally, the analysis tends to summarize what Kelley says rather than thoroughly explain how her choices support her argument. To improve: Use direct quotations and specific instances from the text to highlight Kelley's strategies. Then, provide detailed commentary explaining how each example contributes to the overall persuasiveness of her speech. 3. Explanation of Rhetorical Choices The essay needs to connect Kelley's choices to her broader purpose. Why does she use repetition or rhetorical questions? How do these choices amplify her message and impact on the audience? To improve: Discuss Kelley's purpose for each rhetorical choice and explain its effectiveness within the context of the audience and the time period. 4. Sophistication and Understanding of the Rhetorical Situation The essay could be enhanced by considering the historical context of Kelley's speech (e.g., the status of women's rights, the common labor practices of the era) and explaining how Kelley's choices are particularly effective in light of the audience's values and beliefs. To improve: Explore the significance of Kelley's arguments in the context of the early 20th-century women's suffrage movement, labor reforms, and societal attitudes toward children. 5. Style and Persuasion While the essay generally maintains a straightforward and informative tone, it could incorporate more persuasive and compelling language to mirror the sophistication of Kelley's rhetoric. To improve: Use a style that is engaging and mimics the persuasive intensity of Kelley’s speech. Employ a variety of sentence structures and language that are evocative and emphatic to enhance the argument. In summary, to make the essay stronger and closer to meeting all objectives, rework the thesis to be more precise and defensible, incorporate specific evidence with comprehensive commentary, connect Kelley's choices to her message and the audience, consider the broader rhetorical context, and enhance the style and overall persuasiveness of the essay. Given the 40-minute time constraint, the writer has made a commendable effort, but these improvements will tighten the argument and more closely align the essay with the rubric's standards."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The Given Essay: While we sleep, several thousands of children will be working through the night to produce the clothes that we buy. This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

Kelley's thesis, a clarion call for societal reformation, employs vivid imagery, anaphoric repetition, and piercing rhetorical questions, which coalesce to fortify her position and galvanize her audience to action. This essay will delve into the intricacies of Kelley's eloquence, illuminating the rhetorical stratagems that thrust her audience into the bleak realities of exploited youth, and in doing so, underscores her purpose within the broader context of labor reforms and the burgeoning women's suffrage movement. Kelley's rhetorical choices are an embodiment of precision, each one sculpting her fiery indictment of the systemic oppression of children. Consider her stirring depiction: \\"Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy.\\" The stark contrast between the sleep of the innocent and the toil of the weary, the \\"little girls\\" subjected to an adult's burden, crafts a visceral scene that ensnares the conscience. By making this distress palpable, Kelley does not merely inform; she permeates the hearts of her audience with a sense of shared guilt and moral responsibility. Endlessly echoing through her speech, the words \\"children\\" and \\"they\\" serve as a relentless drumbeat, each repetition a reminder of the tender subjects of her cause. Kelley methodically constructs her sentences with a keen awareness of their auditory impact, as she outlines the myriad industries complicit in this travesty: \\"They make our shoes... they knit our stockings... they carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life.\\" In doing so, Kelley transforms the impersonal \\"they\\" into living, breathing children, each repetition a lash on the conscience of her listeners, an insistence to remember those who labor as they sit in comfort. The strategic deployment of rhetorical questions further sharpens Kelley's argument. She probes, \\"If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age?\\" These questions do not seek answers; they are rhetorical harpoons designed to puncture the facade of society's apathy. They foster a sense of hypothetical reality where justice is within reach, if only the disempowered—women—were given voice through enfranchisement. Kelley's speech is not a solitary cry in the dark but a thread entwined in the larger fabric of women's suffrage and labor activism. Her advocacy for children's welfare is an astute parallel to the suffragettes' struggle for political inclusion. By aligning the cause of disenfranchised mothers with that of their overworked offspring, Kelley unites two movements under the banner of human rights, amplifying the call to arms against societal inequalities. The effectiveness of Kelley's arsenal of rhetorical devices, particularly within the charged atmosphere of the time—with women on the cusp of political power and society grappling with the moral implications of industrialization—cannot be overstated. Florence Kelley wields her narrative like a beacon of change, her speech a resonant plea that courses through the veins of history. By analyzing her rhetorical strategies, we not only uncover the tools with which she constructed her poignant appeal but also how these tools interacted with the consciousness of a society on the brink of monumental shifts. Kelley's triumph, therefore, lies not solely in her capacity to articulate the darkness but more importantly, in her ability to illuminate the path toward a more just and humane world."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

그런 일이 있었다고?” 난감한 표정을 짓는 그녀. 뭐, 비슷한 경우는 연예계에서 비일비재하지만 이렇게 대놓고 사태가 터질 줄은 몰랐던 모양. 따라서 직원들을 대동한 여자 팀장은 묵묵한 강우진에게 붙어 허리를 숙였다. “죄송합니다, 강우진님.” 솔직히 그녀로서는 캐스팅된 성우 몇 날리는 건 상관없었다. “제가 더 신경 쓰고 했어야 됐는데. 성우님들에게 따로 주의를 전달하겠습니다, 다시 사과드릴게요.” 하지만 강우진이 드랍되는 건 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 제작이 스톱될 정도의 크나큰 문제였다. 아니 재앙에 가깝다. 애초 남주 캐릭터인 ‘센고쿠 토오루’ 자체가 강우진을 본떠 만들었고, 홍보부터 마케팅 그리고 숱한 이슈 등으로 강우진이 핵심이었기 때문. 즉, 그가 시청률 관련 메인 딜러였다. 그렇기에 ‘A10 스튜디오’는 강우진의 심기를 건드리면 안 됐다. 반면, 우진은. “괜찮습니다, 이미 다 잊었고.” 별수롭지 않게 고개를 저었다. ‘오늘 사과를 엄청 받네, 어우- 도리어 내가 좀 더 부담되는데?’ 실제로 아까의 사태는 거의 희석된 상태였으니. 이쯤 여자 팀장이 무심한 우진을 가만- 히 보다가 대뜸 속삭였다. “근데 우진님, 그 내기를 하셨어도 가뿐히 이기셨겠는데요?” “그렇습니까?” 당연한 결과였다. “대체······어떻게 성우까지 가능하신. 아니, 완벽하신 거예요?” 뒤로. 충격이 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 대본리딩이 끝난 건 이른 오후쯤이었다. 성우들은 자리를 뜨면서도 우진을 보며 명확히 인지했다. 이거 까딱 잘못하면 먹히겠구나. 과연, 노빠꾸로 선포할만한 실력. 왜 저 한국의 배우가 성우의 자세가 완벽한지 또는 가능한지는 문제가 아니었다. 성우로 밥 먹고 사는 프로들이 밀리게 생겼다. 어쨌든 성우들은 재빨리 리딩장을 빠져나갔고 강우진은 남았다. 피아노, OST 등 녹음이 남았으니까. 그렇게 강우진이 오늘 스케줄을 마치고 호텔로 복귀한 것은 자정이 다돼서였다. 종일 빡빡한 일정이었지만, 아공간덕에 버틴 강우진을 가장 먼저 만난 건 꽁지머리 최성건이었다. “너 임마, 또 리딩장 뒤집었다매? 애들한테 들었다.” 호텔 로비에서 우진을 만난 최성건은 싱글벙글이었다. “아깝네, 일 보는 것만 아니었으면! 그런 장면을 놓치다니.” “딱히 중요한 건 아니었습니다.” “어렵진 않디? 처음 하는 거였잖아.” “별로 어렵진 않았습니다.” “그래, 너답다. 그게 강우진이지.” 곧, 최성건이 우진에게 붙어 속삭였다. “오늘 우리; bw 엔터 헐리웃 쪽 해외 지사 건으로 이것저것 알아본다고 좀 바빴다. 그거 네가 헐리웃 나갔을 때 본진이 될 거여.” 의미심장하게 웃던 최성건이 돌연 주제를 바꿨다. “아, 근데 애니 그거 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 정식 녹음 날은 언제래? 얼추 며칠 뒤라는 얘기는 들었는데.” 강우진이 리딩장에 있던 감독의 멘트를 상기했다. ‘29일인 오늘 리딩을 마치고 이틀 뒤인 31일에 정식 녹음에 들어갑니다. 전체 녹음 스케줄을 3일에서 길면 5일 정도 소요됩니다.’ ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 정식 녹음은 5월의 마지막 31일. 즉, 이틀 뒤였다. 31일, 월요일. 아침 10시쯤. ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 정식 더빙 녹음이 있는 날. 참고로 소집 시각은 정오쯤. 그리고 오늘 쿄타로 감독 포함 ‘낯기생’ 전 스탭들이 히데키 회장의 호출을 받았다. ‘카시히 도쿄 호텔’의 홀에 마련된 회식을 하기 위함이었다. 드넓은 홀의 둥그런 테이블 위엔 휘황찬란한 음식들과 각종 음료나 술들이 세팅됐다. 크랭크 업을 기념해 히데키 회장이 마련한 자리. 뒤풀이라면 뒤풀이. 사실, 메인 투자자가 이렇게까지 할 건 없지만, 크랭크업 현장을 방문했던 히데키 회장은 나름 감격했기에 자진해서 스탭들을 불러 모았다. 어쨌든. “우와! 엄청 맛있어!!” “많이 먹어둬! 이런 음식 어디 가서 먹어보겠냐고!” “말할 시간도 아까워요!” ‘낯기생’의 백여 명 스탭들은 정신없이 회식을 즐겼다. 물론, 배우들이나 기타 관계자들도 섞였다. 허나 왜인지 쿄타로 감독이나 아카리 작가 그리고 강우진이 보이지 않았다. 당연했다. 그들은 전부 홀과 가까운 접대실에 모여 있었으니까. 퍽 넓은 룸에 모인 인원을 정확히 말하자면 테이블 상석의 히데키 회장, 그를 기준으로 양옆에 쿄타로 감독과 아카리 작가, 그다음 강우진과 최성건이 자리했다. 끝쪽엔 영화사 대표나 배급사 간부도 보였다. 얼추 열댓 명. 분위기는 약간 진중했다. 강우진의 표정도. 다만, 그의 속내는 투덜대고 있었다. ‘아오- 씨, 뭔 중요한 얘기면 윗선들끼리 알아서 하지. 배고파 뒤지겠구만.’ 홀 쪽에 즐비한 고급진 음식들을 갈구하고 있었으니까. 하지만 겉으로 티 내진 않는다. 곧 상석에 자리한, 정장 재킷을 벗은 히데키 회장이 까끌한 목소리를 냈다. “일단, 다들 고생했어요. 그런데 그- 바뀐 결말 말이야. 거리낌 없이 진행하자곤 했는데, 다들 마음의 준비는 해두자는 의미에서 모이자고 했어요. 얘기 좀 들어볼 겸 해서.” 그는 ‘카시히 그룹’의 총수였다. 이 자리 누구보다 경험이 많을 터였고, 미래의 ‘낯기생’의 모습이 선명하기도 했다. 히데키 회장이 오른쪽의 아카리 작가에 시선을 붙이며 다시 일본어를 뱉었다. “일단 ‘낯기생’이 개봉하면 시발탄은 아마- ‘낯기생’의 원작 팬들이 쏠 거야. 그 지진 같은 흐름은 금방 물타기를 할 거고 연예계 포함 대중들 사이로 여기저기 젖어 들겠지. 그게 논란이든 원성이든 뭐든 간에.” 히데키 회장을 포함해 이 자리에 모인 모두가 예상한 그림이었다. “강행한다는 건 알아요, 나도 동의한 바고. 대신에 사전에 대비는 해두는 게 좋지 않을까?” “맞습니다.” 쿄타로 감독을 시작으로 영화사나 배급사 대표와 간부가 고개를 끄덕였다. 어차피 영화 촬영 끝난 뒤 하려던 얘기기도 했다. 이어 턱을 쓸던 히데키 회장이 쿄타로 감독에게 물었다. “의심하는 건 아니에요, 내 눈으로 보기도 했고. 다만, 감독의 눈은 또 다르니까. 어때요? ‘낯기생’의 퀄리티는 확신합니까?” “······편집이 남긴 했지만.” 새치 가득한 쿄타로 감독이 목소리에 힘을 넣었다. “제 영화밥 통틀어서 최고의 영화가 나올 거라 생각합니다.” 한 영화가 거대한 논란이 터졌을 때 작품 퀄까지 쓰레기면 상황은 매우 안 좋아진다. 하지만 ‘낯기생’은 일단 그 부분은 배제해도 괜찮다는 얘기였다. 100% 확실한 건 아니지만, 저 거장 쿄타로 감독이 호언장담했으니까. 곧, 히데키 회장이 천천히 고개를 끄덕였고. “음, 그렇다면 작품에는 아무 문제가 없다는 거고.” 배급사 쪽 간부가 끼었다. “저- 아무래도 ‘낯기생’이 제작 초반부터 시끄럽기도 했고, 이미 다른 경쟁작들에 비해 상당히 높은 인지도를 가진 편입니다. 명확한 조사를 해봐야겠지만 SNS 쪽만 보더라도 ‘낯기생’을 모르는 사람이 없을 정돕니다.” 흰털 섞인 눈썹 한쪽을 작게 올린 히데키 회장이 묵묵히 앉은 강우진을 힐끔했다. “음, 최근의 우진씨 힘이 컸지.” “예. 맞습니다. 그러니 영화의 개봉 두 달 전쯤, 본격 홍보 마케팅이 시작될 때 화력을 조금 줄여보면 어떻습니까?” “줄인다?” “예. 기본적인 홍보는 하되, 제작발표회나 마케팅 스케줄을 적당히 패스하는 겁니다. 여러 시사회도 조금 축소하고.” “예상되는 잡음을 최대치로 줄이겠다 뭐 그런 건가요?” “그런 의도입니다.” 보통이라면 미친 듯이 홍보 및 마케팅을 돌리겠지만, ‘낯기생’은 이미 많은 화제가 터진 상태였다. 그러니 예견된 논란과 원성을 최대한 줄여보자는 뜻이었다. 솔직히 불길이 어느 정도로 크게 번질지 그 누구도 장담할 순 없지만, 영화사나 배급사의 예상으론 퍽 거대할 것은 분명했다. 이에 팔짱을 낀 메인 투자자 히데키 회장이 침음을 뱉었다. “흠-” 분위기가 상당히 무거워진다. 여기서 뜬금 히데키 회장의 시선이 중간쯤 앉은 강우진에게 붙었다. “우진씨 생각은 어떤가?” 뜬금 강우진에게 던져진 질문. 물론, 우진은 포커페이스를 유지하고 있었다. 하지만 속으론 약간 화들짝했다. ‘이 할아버지가 갑자기 뭔? 그걸 나한테 물어? 그런 건 윗선들이 알아서 하면 되잖아.’ 알아서 하라는 마음이 컸지만 컨셉질이 짙은 그에겐 후진이 있어선 안됐다. 여기선 근엄히 한칼을 날려야 했다. 뭣보다. ‘근데 홍보를 축소한다는 게 좀- 짜치지 않나?? 나만 그래? 뭔가 도망치는 거 같잖아.’ 우진의 본심은 현 상황과는 전혀 달랐다. ‘한국으로 튀면 되는’ 그였기에 가능한 판단이기도 했다. 여기 있는 모두와 마인드 자체가 판이하다. 그런 우진이. -스윽. 자신을 보는 히데키 회장을 시작으로 쿄타로 감독, 아카리 작가, 최성건, 배급사와 영화사 대표 등을 훑었다. 시선 집중. 어우- 씨 더럽게 부담되네. 하지만 강우진은 속내와 달리 매우 차분한 목소리를 냈다. 낮고 간결한 일본어였다. “오히려 판을 더욱 키우는 게 낫다고 판단합니다, 전.” 대부분이 놀랐다. 그중 대답은 상석의 히데키 회장이 했고. “···판을 더 키워?” 강우진은 세상 침착했다. “예. 뒷걸음질 치면 사람들이 더 바보처럼 볼 겁니다, 욕하는 흐름도 강해질 것이고.” 히데키 회장의 주름진 입에 미소가 번졌다. “이럴수록 더 반듯하게, 도리어 상황을 증폭시키자라- 우리 쪽이 선수 치듯 홍보, 마케팅 포함 제작발표회나 행사 등 모든 판을 기존보다 더 키우는 거군. 기자들이나 관계자들도 보통보다 많이 부르고.” “예. 즉, 쫄지말고 혼돈의 씨앗을 더욱더 뿌려보자는 뜻. 미소가 짙어진 히데키 회장이 강우진에게 말했고. “우리 쪽이 몇 배 더 키운 판을 정면돌파.” 강우진이 무심한 톤으로 답했다. “제 생각은 그렇습니다.” 한편, 같은 시각. 한국. 한국의 영화계 언론은 어제였던 주말 관련 기사를 꽤 쏟아내고 있었다. 『주말 극장가는 인산인해, 영화 관람을 위해 몰린 인파들로 발 디딜 틈 없는 영화관/ 사진』영화관 만석 『[무비톡]신드롬 ‘실종의 섬’보러 온 자동차들로 가득찬 자동차극장』 그리고 경남 진주의 죽집에선 강우진의 부모인 서현미, 강우철이 오픈 준비를 하다 말고 벽에 걸린 대형 TV를 올려보고 있었다. “······” “······” 둘 다 그저 넋 빠진 채 TV를 보는 중. 현재 TV에선 아침 뉴스가 흘러나오고 있었다. 문화 관련 코너 순서. 여자 앵커의 또박또박한 음성이 울린다.

The content included the appearance of the male lead 'Sengoku Tooru' and the female lead Enma Kyoko, an explanation of 'Sengoku Tooru's' personality and a simple high school background, an appropriate glimpse of the supporting characters, and the start of the main incident. In the future completed version, 'Sengoku Tooru's' past and his piano performance will be added. In other words, the content of the first episode of \\"Male Friend: Remake\\" is mostly devoted to the male lead 'Sengoku Tooru'. That means he has a lot of lines. There were also quite a few monologues from the male lead, like stage directions, in the middle. However, Kang Woojin was. \\"Oh- The anime quality is really good?? The animation is amazing. This anime production company is huge, and there's a reason for that.\\" Even while voicing the male lead, he was so relaxed that he could enjoy watching the anime displayed on the monitor. It was easier than he thought. Maybe it's because he didn't have to move his body like acting. Of course, he had to put a lot of effort into his voice, but for Woojin, who already had 'Sengoku Tooru', there was nothing difficult. When Sengoku Tooru is brought up, Woojin's surroundings become animated. The scenery of this reading room disappears. The cheat item, the pocket dimension, was the same in the voice acting world. In fact, if you consider the difficulty, the voice acting side was several times easier. So, how much would Kang Woojin fly around? The voice actors and the director, shocked by the fluent Woojin, didn't find their stunned eyes strange at all. \\"How can the lip-syncing be so perfect?! Are you sure this is his first time as a voice actor??!\\" \\"Even if you write the time sheet on the script... it's natural to make mistakes. Why doesn't he get it wrong even once? Even veterans can't do that much, can they??\\" Even more so. \\"It's not just about getting the lines right. He's full of emotion, and in the meantime, he's adjusting the tone and stress...\\" Kang Woojin, who was voice acting for the first time, was accurate with rich emotions and tone control. Even Asami Saya was surprised enough to widen her eyes. \\"Practice? No, it's not a level that's possible with just practice.\\" Mistakes were actually more common among the Japanese voice actors. The atmosphere in the reading room quickly heated up. Among the more than 50 people present, exclamation marks and question marks were floating around. Regardless, Kang Woojin calmly did what he had to do. And so. \\"...Cut. Let's take a short break.\\" After finishing the reading of episode 2, the director declared a break. However, the voice actors were all immobile. They were too shocked to move. This was the same for the executives and employees of 'A10 Studio'. Only the female team manager in charge of the overall progress, from the planning department, was thinking straight. \\"My goodness. I thought he would cover it to some extent because he acts well... but no mistakes at all?\\" Then she heard about the commotion that had happened earlier through an employee. \\"What? That happened?\\" The woman team manager made a troubled face. Well, similar cases are common in the entertainment industry, but it seemed she didn't expect the situation to blow up so openly. Therefore, the female team manager, accompanied by her employees, approached the silent Kang Woojin and bowed. \\"I'm sorry, Mr. Kang Woojin.\\" Honestly, for her, it didn't matter if a few cast voice actors were fired. \\"I should have paid more attention. I will pass on a separate warning to the voice actors, and I apologize again.\\" However, if Kang Woojin dropped out, it would be a huge problem that could stop the production of \\"Male Friend: Remake\\". It was almost a disaster. From the beginning, the character of the male lead 'Sengoku Tooru' was created based on Kang Woojin, and he was the core from promotion to marketing and numerous issues. In other words, he was the main dealer related to the viewership ratings. Therefore, 'A10 Studio' could not afford to upset Kang Woojin. On the other hand, Woojin was. \\"It's okay, I've already forgotten about it.\\" He shook his head as if it was nothing. 'I'm getting a lot of apologies today, ugh- It's actually a bit burdensome for me?' In fact, the earlier incident had almost been diluted. At this point, the female team manager quietly watched the indifferent Woojin and suddenly whispered. \\"But Mr. Woojin, you would have easily won even if you had made that bet, right?\\" \\"Is that so?\\" It was an obvious result. \\"How can you be so perfect as a voice actor... No, how is it possible?\\" Meanwhile. The shock of 'Male Friend: Remake's script reading ended in the early afternoon. The voice actors, while leaving their seats, clearly recognized something about Woojin. This could be dangerous if we're not careful. Indeed, the skill was worth declaring no retreat. It wasn't a question of why that Korean actor had a perfect voice acting posture or how it was possible. The professional voice actors who make a living off voice acting were about to be outdone. Anyway, the voice actors quickly left the reading room, and Kang Woojin remained. There was still piano and OST recording left. So Kang Woojin finished his schedule for the day and returned to the hotel around midnight. It had been a tight schedule all day, but the first person to meet the enduring Kang Woojin thanks to the pocket dimension was Choi Seonggeon with a ponytail. \\"You, you turned the reading room upside down again? I heard from the kids.\\" Choi Seonggeon, who met Woojin in the hotel lobby, was beaming. \\"It's a shame, if it wasn't for work! To miss such a scene.\\" \\"It wasn't anything important.\\" \\"Wasn't it difficult? It was your first time.\\" \\"It wasn't particularly difficult.\\" \\"That's like you. That's Kang Woojin.\\" Soon, Choi Seonggeon whispered to Woojin. \\"I was a bit busy today; I was looking into various things for the overseas branch of bw Entertainment in Hollywood. That will be your base when you go to Hollywood.\\" Choi Seonggeon smiled meaningfully and suddenly changed the subject. \\"Oh, but when is the official recording for the anime 'Male Friend: Remake'? I heard it's in a few days.\\" Kang Woojin recalled the director's comment in the reading room. 'The reading ends today on the 29th, and two days later, on the 31st, we will enter the official recording. The entire recording schedule will take about 3 to 5 days.' The official recording of 'Male Friend: Remake' was on the last day of May, the 31st. In other words, it was two days later. May 31st, Monday. Around 10 a.m. The day of the official dubbing recording for 'Male Friend: Remake'. For reference, the assembly time was around noon. And today, including director Kyotaro and the entire staff of 'Nakigoe', were called by Chairman Hideki. It was for a banquet prepared in the hall of 'Kashihi Tokyo Hotel'. On the round tables in the spacious hall, dazzling foods and various drinks and alcohol were set up. A gathering arranged by Chairman Hideki to celebrate the crank-up. If it could be called an after-party. In fact, the main investor didn't have to go this far, but Chairman Hideki, who had visited the crank-up site, was somewhat moved and voluntarily gathered the staff. Anyway. \\"Wow! It's so delicious!!\\" \\"Eat a lot! Where else would you get to eat such food!\\" \\"I don't even have time to talk!\\" The hundred or so staff of 'Nakigoe' were frantically enjoying the banquet. Of course, actors and other related parties were also mixed in. However, for some reason, director Kyotaro, writer Akari, and Kang Woojin were not seen. It was natural. They were all gathered in a reception room close to the hall. In the spacious room, the people gathered were precisely Chairman Hideki at the head of the table, with director Kyotaro and writer Akari on either side of him, followed by Kang Woojin and Choi Seonggeon. At the end, representatives of the film company and distribution company executives were also seen. Roughly a dozen people. The atmosphere was somewhat serious. So was Kang Woojin's expression. However, his inner thoughts were grumbling. 'Ah, geez, if it's something important, the higher-ups should handle it. I'm starving to death.' He was craving the luxurious food on the other side of the hall. But he didn't show it outwardly. Soon, Chairman Hideki, who had taken off his suit jacket, spoke in a raspy voice. \\"First of all, everyone worked hard. But about that changed ending. I said to proceed without hesitation, but I called everyone here to prepare mentally and to have a talk.\\" He was the head of 'Kashihi Group'. He had more experience than anyone else here, and he had a clear vision of the future of 'Nakigoe'. Chairman Hideki turned his gaze to writer Akari on his right and spoke again in Japanese. \\"Once 'Nakigoe' is released, the starting bullet will probably be from the original fans of 'Nakigoe'. That earthquake-like trend will soon be watered down and seep into the public, including the entertainment industry. Whether it's controversy or complaints.\\" It was a picture that everyone gathered here, including Chairman Hideki, had anticipated. \\"I know we're going ahead with it, and I agreed. But wouldn't it be better to be prepared in advance?\\" \\"That's right.\\" Starting with director Kyotaro, the film company and distribution company representatives and executives nodded. It was a conversation they had planned to have after the film shooting anyway. Then, Chairman Hideki, stroking his chin, asked director Kyotaro. \\"I'm not doubting you, I've seen it with my own eyes. But a director's view is different. What do you think? Are you confident in the quality of 'Nakigoe'?\\" \\"...Although editing is still left.\\" Director Kyotaro, full of gray hair, spoke with strength in his voice. \\"I believe it will be the best movie of my entire film career.\\" When a huge controversy erupts over a film, if the quality of the work is also trash, the situation becomes very bad. However, 'Nakigoe' was said to be fine even without that part. It wasn't 100% certain, but since the great master director Kyotaro was so confident, it was believable. Soon, Chairman Hideki slowly nodded. \\"Hmm, then there's no problem with the work.\\" An executive from the distribution side chimed in. \\"Well, since 'Nakigoe' has been noisy since the beginning of production, and it already has a considerably high recognition compared to other competing works. We need to do a clear investigation, but just looking at SNS, there's no one who doesn't know about 'Nakigoe'.\\" Chairman Hideki, with one white eyebrow slightly raised, glanced at Kang Woojin, who was sitting silently. \\"Hmm, Woojin's recent influence has been significant.\\" \\"Yes. That's correct. So, about two months before the movie's release, when the full-scale promotion and marketing start, how about we reduce the firepower a bit?\\" \\"Reduce it?\\" \\"Yes. We do the basic promotion, but we pass on the production announcement conference and marketing schedule appropriately. We also slightly reduce the number of preview screenings.\\" \\"Are you trying to minimize the expected noise as much as possible?\\" \\"That's the intention.\\" Normally, they would run promotions and marketing like crazy, but 'Nakigoe' was already a hot topic. So, the idea was to reduce the anticipated controversy and complaints as much as possible. Honestly, no one could guarantee how big the fire would spread, but the film company and distribution company expected it to be quite massive. With that, Chairman Hideki, the main investor with his arms crossed, let out a hum. \\"Hmm-\\" The atmosphere became quite heavy. Suddenly, Chairman Hideki's gaze fell on Kang Woojin, who was sitting in the middle. \\"What do you think, Mr. Woojin?\\" The question was thrown unexpectedly at Kang Woojin. Of course, Woojin maintained a poker face. But inside, he was slightly startled. 'Why is this old man suddenly asking me? They should handle that themselves.' He had a strong feeling that they should handle it themselves, but he couldn't show weakness in his concept. Here, he had to deliver a decisive blow. Moreover. 'But isn't it a bit annoying to reduce the promotion?? Is it just me? It feels like running away.' Woojin's true feelings were completely different from the current situation. 'I can just run away to Korea,' he thought, which was a judgment he could make. His mindset was completely different from everyone else here. Woojin, who was. -Swish. He glanced at Chairman Hideki, who was looking at him, then director Kyotaro, writer Akari, Choi Seonggeon, the representatives of the distribution and film companies. The focus was on him. Ugh, this is so burdensome. However, Kang Woojin, contrary to his inner thoughts, spoke in a very calm voice. It was a low and concise Japanese. \\"I believe it would be better to expand the scale even more.\\" Most were surprised. Among them, Chairman Hideki at the head of the table responded. \\"...Expand the scale more?\\" Kang Woojin was completely calm. \\"Yes. If we backpedal, people will see us more like fools, and the trend of insults will intensify.\\" A smile spread across Chairman Hideki's wrinkled mouth. \\"So, we should stand up straighter, and instead amplify the situation as if we're taking the initiative. We'll expand all the boards, including promotion, marketing, production announcement conferences, and events, more than before. We'll invite more journalists and related parties than usual.\\" \\"Yes. In other words, don't be scared and let's spread the seeds of chaos even more. Chairman Hideki, with a deepening smile, said to Kang Woojin. \\"We'll break through the board that we've expanded several times over.\\" Kang Woojin replied in an indifferent tone. \\"That's what I think.\\" Meanwhile, at the same time. In Korea. The Korean film industry media was pouring out articles related to the weekend that was yesterday. 『The weekend theaters are packed with people, the cinemas are filled with crowds coming to watch movies/ Photos』 Full house at the cinema 『[Movie Talk] The car theater filled with cars coming to watch the phenomenon 'Island of the Missing'』 And at a bamboo house restaurant in Jinju, Gyeongnam, Kang Woojin's parents, Seo Hyunmi and Kang Woocheol, were preparing to open but stopped to look up at the large TV on the wall. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" Both were just staring blankly at the TV. The morning news was currently flowing on the TV. It was the cultural segment. The female anchor's clear voice rang out.

음 그래 불어. 솔직히 강우진이 살면서 불어를 해볼 일이나 있었을까? 아니, 아마 아공간이 없었다면. ‘뒤질 때까지 생각도 안 해봤겠지.’ 영어나 일본어야 주변에서 자주 들리니 그러려니 하겠지만, 불어라는 언어는 생소하기 짝이 없었다. 하지만 강우진의 흥분도는 끝없이 올라간다. ‘어디서든 쓸모는 있지 않겠냐? 뭐가 됐든 언어 하나를 이렇게 개편하게 습득하는데 쌉이득이지!’ 전세계 언어를 가질 수도 있는 강우진이었다. 뭐, 백날천날 써먹지는 못하겠지만 내면에 각인되는 것만으로도 다분히 흥분될만했다. 이쯤 컴컴한 아공간에 선 우진에게 익숙한, 끝없이 거대한 회색이 보였다. 회색이 강우진을 덮친다. 우진은 웃었다. 짧은 순간 생각했다. 빠른 시일 내에. “아- 그래, 불어. 칸 영화제 가면 써먹을 수도 있겠네.” 불어를 쓸 수 있는 무대를 떠올린 것이었다. 시간이 얼마나 흘렀나? bw 엔터의 대회의실은 점차 더 붐비기 시작했다. 각 팀의 팀장들은 물론이며, 배우들의 스탭들도 나타나기 시작했으니까. 다들 같은 회사지만 얼굴 보기 힘든 탓에 인사하기 바쁘다. 와중. “······” “······” 이미 자리에 앉은, bw 엔터의 간판 배우 두 명은 왜인지 입을 다물고 있었다. 강우진과 홍혜연. 우진은 그녀가 내민 시나리오를 가만- 히 내려보고 있었고, 긴 생머리를 쓸어넘긴 홍혜연은 작게 미간을 좁히며 강우진을 본다. ‘뭐야, 괜히 긴장돼. 왜 아무 말이 없어?’ 평소에도 과묵한 편인 강우진이긴 했지만, 시나리오를 본 뒤부터 그는 더 없이 침착해졌다. 홍혜연은 은근 긴장됐다. 주변에 시선이 많아 아닌 척은 하지만 우진에게서 눈을 못 뗐다. 이때. -팔락. 뭐랄까, 티 안 나게 멈칫하던 강우진이 보던 시나리오 한 장을 넘겼다. 여전히 표정은 근엄했다. 고민하는 홍혜연. 그냥 물어볼까? 하지만 역시 그녀는 입을 열진 않았다. 그러면서도 생각했다. ‘······근데 우진씨가 별로라고 하면 난 이걸 안 해야 되나?’ 작품은 분명 나름 마음에 든 홍혜연이었다. 다만, 강우진이 낮고 확고하게 ‘재미없다’라고 한다면 어떨까? 역시 패스하는 게 맞나? 그러다 문득 그녀는 작게 고개를 저었다. ‘아니. 기대는 건 안 돼.’ 강우진의 감이나 동물적인 느낌은 분명 신들릴 정도로 대단했다. 과거에도 증거는 많았고, 지금껏 그가 들어간 작품은 모두 초대박을 쳤다. 믿고 안 믿고의 기준점을 넘었다. 종교다. 강우진의 말을 듣는 것이 무조건 나을 것. 하지만 그리 의지해서는 나쁜 버릇이 들 수 있다. 최소 홍혜연의 생각에선 그랬다. ‘그냥 참고만. 쓰레기라고 말해도 내가 해야겠다 하면···하는 게 맞아.’ 약간 차가운 투의 강우진 목소리가 들린 건 그때였다. “고맙습니다.” “아 정말? 재미가······어? 잠깐만요. 고마워? 뭐가요?” 얼굴에 의아함이 묻은 홍혜연이 되묻자 강우진이 대수롭지 않게 답했다. “그냥요.” “에?” “그리고 이 시나리오, 나쁘지 않습니다.” “고맙다에서 나쁘지 않다로 튀는 거예요?” “순서를 바꿔 드릴까요.” “뭐가 달라요?” “들어보시면 알겠죠.” 이 남자가 진짜. 늘 그랬지만, 강우진과 얘기하면 휘둘린다 생각한 그녀가 아랫입술을 작게 깨물었다. 동시에 홍혜연이 우진의 손에서 시나리오를 뺐으며 헛기침했다. “큼! 여튼요. 저도 고마워요, 이거 봐줘서.” 강우진이 각인된 불어를 상기하며 솔직하게 읊조렸다. “이 정도는 얼마든지요.” 다음 날 7일. 월요일. 정신없던 주말이 지나고 평일이 밝았다. 시간은 아침 7시쯤. 이른 아침이지만 강우진은방금 샵에서 나온 참이었다. 뒤로 넘긴 헤어와 메이크업은 이미 완료된 상태. 이유야 간단했다. ‘오늘도 뭐 스케줄 풀.’ 이른 아침부터 바삐 움직여야 할 일정이었으니까. 어제인 일요일은 거의 대부분 ‘거머리’ 촬영으로 보냈으나, 오늘은 대략 정오가 조금 지난 뒤 합류하면 됐다. 대신에 아침과 점심까지 사이에 스케줄이 촘촘했다. “우진아!” 샵의 외부 주차장에 세워진 커다란 밴에서 꽁지머리 최성건이 손을 흔들었다. 며칠간 회사 일로 안 보였고 오늘 아침에도 없던 그가 복귀한 것. “하하, 안 보고 싶었냐? 난 그- 너의 딱딱한 얼굴 며칠 안 보니까 서운하더만.” 포커페이스가 짙은 우진의 어깨를 두어 번 치던 최성건이 움직이자는 손짓을 던졌다. 곧, 여러 스탭들이 탄 강우진의 밴이 샵을 벗어났다. 그런 밴이 도로를 달리기 시작할 쯤, 기지개를 쭉 켜던 최성건이 몸을 돌려 강우진에게 말했다. “일단, 어울림 영화사부터 간다.” 현재 한국 영화계를 뒤집어엎은 ‘실종의 섬’을 제작한 어울림 영화사. 이 아침부터 우진이 상암동의 어울림 영화사로 이동하는 이유는 간단했다. “관람객들 놀라 자빠지겠구먼.” 금의환향한 강우진이 ‘실종의 섬’ 관련 후반 홍보에 지원 사격을 시작하는 것이 오늘부터니까. 그것을 위해 강우진 포함 모두는 어울림 영화사에 일단 모이기로 했다. 뒤로 잠시간 설명을 잇던 최성건이 핸드폰을 꺼내며 주제를 바꿨다. “일본 쪽은 뭐, 네가 빠졌는데도 더 난리네.” 강우진이 없는 일본 쪽의 얘기였다. “우리가 의도적으로 뿌리는 거하고, ‘낯기생’ 영화사랑 배급사가 돌리기 시작한 게 있다고 쳐도 예상보다 몇 배는 시끄럽다.” 실제로 그랬다. 심지어 일본 언론은 마치 강우진에게 돌아오라고 울부짖듯, 한국의 영화인 ‘실종의 섬’의 실시간 성적도 일본에 알리고 있었다. 그뿐인가? 현재 본격 편집에 돌입한 ‘낯기생’과 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 관련도 미친 듯이 파생된다. 거기에 더해. 『낯기생 주연 중 한 명「우라마츠 미후유」, “강우진 부캐 채널 게스트 나갈 예정이며 한국 방문 설렌다”』 강우진을 경험한 일본 배우들의 인터뷰, 예능 출연 등이 엮이면서 눈덩이가 상당히 커지고 있었다. 그 중심엔 늘 강우진이 존재했다. 그럴수록, 우진의 활동 영역이 넓어질수록 일본 연예계에 미치는 우진의 영향력은 커진다. 이름이 오르락내리락 안 할 수가 없다. 배우, 성우, 감독, PD, 스탭, 관계자 외의 일본 연예계에 산재하는 수많은 인물들. 그들 사이로는 최근 유별나게 여러 감정들이 뒤섞였다. 견제, 시기, 기대, 질투, 감탄, 괄시. 그에 관한 방증은 아주 쉽게 찾을 수 있었다. 예를 들어, 최근 ‘낯기생’ 촬영을 마치고 잠시 휴식을 취하는 마나 코사쿠. ‘낯기생’에서 형사 요시자와 모치오를 맡았던 일본 배우. 우진과 가장 많은 대사를 주고받았었던 그는 사모임의 자리에 나온 참이었다. 그의 태생은 일본 유명 밴드지만, 지금 그가 나온 사모임은 일본 탑배우들로만 형성됐다. 얼추 열댓 명. 여기서 마나 코사쿠는. “너희들도 강우진과 연기를 한다면 느낄 거야, 그는 타국의 배우지만 배울 점이 상당하다고. 한국의 배우인 게 아쉬울 따름이야.” 입에 침이 마르게 강우진을 극찬하고 있었다. 이상한 모습은 아니었다. ‘낯기생’ 촬영 내내 우진에게서 몇 번이나 경이로움을 느낀 그였으니까. 다만, 그것을 말로써 표현하긴 힘들다. 그렇기에 경험과 칭찬을 열심히 전하는 것. “이제 일본 배우판은 변해야 돼. 아마 그가 수면 위로 올라오면 많은 배우들이 각성할 거야.” 하지만 이 사모임에 모인 일본 탑배우들 대부분은 코사쿠와 같은 마음이 아니었다. 오히려 반 이상은 아까부터 그를 아니꼽게 보고 있었다. 아니, 왜 자꾸 짜증 나게 그의 이름을 꺼내는 거야? 따위의 표정이었다. 그러다 결국. “어이, 코사쿠.” 양주를 홀짝이던 일본 배우 한 명이 울컥한 심정을 뱉었고. “너 너무 심하게 강우진을 빨아주는 거 아니야? 지겨울 정돈데.” 몇몇 남녀 배우들이 고개 끄덕이며 동참한다. “그러게. 안 그래도 요즘 그 강우진 얘기로 언론, 여론 시끄러워서 불편해 죽겠구만.” “그만해 코사쿠. 우리가 그 배우에게 뭘 배울 게 있다고 그래.” “있다고 한들 대선배님들에게 배우지, 2년 차 한국배우에게 배운다는 게 말이 되나?” 결과적으론 나머지 배우들도 비슷한 반응을 보였다. 그중, 제일 처음 짜증을 부렸던 배우가 다시 마나 코사쿠에게 미간을 찌푸리며 물었다. “코사쿠. 너도 일본의 탑배우 중 한 명이야. 강우진의 뭐에 반했는지는 모르지만 조금 꼴사납게도 보여. 긍지는 버린 거냐?” 긍지? 과일 안주 중 수박을 집던 마나 코사쿠는 하마터면 웃음이 터질 뻔했다. 아니, 실제로 조금 실소는 나왔다. “크크, 긍지? 긍지라-” 그러면서 자신을 보는 일본 배우들을 쭉 훑었다. 얼굴에 불편함이 가득하다. 아, 그렇군. 코사쿠는 순간 직감했다. “변하려면 한참이겠어.” 일본의 이 배우판. 아니, 썩은 물이 정화되려면 너무도 긴 시간이 필요하다는, 그 사이에서 헤엄치던 게 자신이었다는 걸 말이다. 하지만 우진을 본 뒤로 그는 각성했다. “내가 왜 여기 있었을까. 나도 눈이 멀었었어. 타노구치 쿄타로 감독님의 말들이 이제야 이해가 가.” 그의 혼잣말에 주변 일본 배우들은 미간을 더 구겼다. “뭐? 코사쿠 혼자 뭐라고 하는 거야.” “에이, 괜히 분위기 흐리지 말고 마시자고.” 하지만 마나 코사쿠는 별 대답 없이 소파에서 일어났다. 그러면서 글라스 잔을 드는 일본 배우들에게 나지막이 말했고. “너희 모두는 이 좁은 웅덩이에 고였어. 그래서 여기가 전부인 줄 알아. 위를 보고 발버둥 치지 않으면 썩어버릴 거야, 냄새를 풍기며.” “뭐, 뭣?! 이봐!!” 제일 처음 짜증 낸 일본 배우와 시선을 맞춘 코사쿠가 최근에 목도했던, 온몸에 소름이 돋았던 강우진의 ‘낯기생’ 마지막 씬을 상기하며 웃었다. “겐지로, 네가 강우진과 연기할 날은 없겠지만 하나 말해 줄게.” “······뭐지.” “나라고 처음부터 강우진이 편했던 건 아니야. 당당한 그의 콧대를 꺾어보고도 싶었고.” “그런데?” “의미 없는 짓이야.” 코사쿠의 미소가 깊어진다. 많은 의미가 담긴 웃음이었다. “긍지나 뭐 그런 건 강우진의 앞에선 쓰레기나 다름없어.” 그대로 사모임 인원이 모였던 룸을 빠져나온 코사쿠. 그가 천천히 복도를 걸으며 나지막이 읊조렸다. “배우들의 정신상태가 저 모양인데- ‘낯기생’ 개봉하면 진짜 볼만 하겠군.” 한편, 한국. 상암동 어울림 영화사. 강우진을 태운 밴이 영화사의 주차장에서 멈췄다. 곧바로 내리는 강우진. 그의 오늘 의상은 얇은 흰 셔츠에 청바지였다. 이어 스타일리스트 등의 팀 인원은 밴에 남고, 우진과 최성건만이 엘리베이터로 움직였다. 도착한 것은 3층. -띵! 엘리베이터 문이 열리자마자 최성건이 복도를 따라 오른쪽으로 꺾었다. 반면, 강우진은 왜인이 왼쪽으로 움직였다. 그러면서 낮은 톤으로 최성건에게 말했다. “화장실 좀.” 고개 끄덕이며 꽁지머리를 재차 묶던 최성건이 엄지를 보였다. “오케이- 먼저 가서 자리 펴고 있을게.” “예, 대표님.” 짧게 답한 우진이 다시금 침착한 발걸음을 옮겼다. “······” 가는 내내 그의 얼굴은 딱딱했다. 변화는 없다. 화장실 유리문을 열었다. 안을 살피는 강우진. 사람은 없다. “훗.” 잠시잠깐 입가에 미소가 스친 우진이 입을 열었다. 다만, 이번에 그의 입에서 쏟아지는 건 한국어가 아니었다. [“나는 강우진이고, 한국의 배우입니다.”] 이미 각인된 불어였다. 써도써도 신기했다. 평생을 써온 것처럼 유창했으니까. 얼굴을 가린다면 프랑스에 사는 사람이라 봐도 전혀 이상하지 않았다. ‘이게 발음이 개특이하네 진심.’ 영어나 일본어와 달리 묘한 쾌감이 있다. 덕분에 우진은 오줌을 갈긴 뒤 손을 씻으면서 다른 불어를 뱉었다. [“오늘 점심은 뭐가 나올까, 고기가 나왔으면 좋겠네.”] ‘거머리’ 현장의 밥차는 수준급의 맛을 자랑했다. 몇 시간 뒤 현장에 도착하면 바로 점심을 먹는데 고기가 나왔으면. 아무 거리낌 없이 나오는 불어. 강우진은 미소를 머금으며 물기 묻은 손을 탈탈 털었다. 그 순간. -스으. 화장실 유리문이 열렸다. 인기척에 우진은 단숨에 컨셉질을 입혔고 몸을 돌렸다. 화장실 문을 연 건 존잘남. 아니, 초록색 니트 반팔을 걸친 탑배우 류정민이었다. 그 역시 강우진과 같은 목적으로 영화사에 도착한 것. 특이한 건 그의 동공이 퍽 커졌다는 것. “우진씨.” 그런 류정민이 무던하게 선 우진에게 한 걸음 다가서며 말했다. “······밖에서 얼핏 들었는데. 불어였죠? 설마 불어도 할 줄 아는 겁니까?” 생각지 못한 상황이었으나 무심한 얼굴의 강우진은 태연하게 반응했다. 즉, 적당히 둘러댔다. “아니요. 그냥 인사말 정도만 연습해본 겁니다.” “인사말?” 번개처럼 우진의 머릿속을 스치는 영화제가 있었다. 불어가 각인되기 직전 아공간에서도 떠올랐던 것. “네, 칸 영화제요.” 바로 칸 영화제. 잘했다, 자연스러웠어. 칸 영화제를 위한 가벼운 인사말을 연습했다 하면 되지. 불어가 각인된 걸 숨길 필요는 없지만 굳이 지금 알릴 이유도 없다. 괜히 귀찮기도 하고. 반면, 류정민은 더 이상한 듯 두 눈을 끔뻑였다. “칸? 칸- 이면 아직 몇 달은 남았고, 굳이 불어로 인사를 준비 안 해도 통역은 붙을 텐데요. 거기다 수상으로 무대 오를 게 아니라면···인사말을 할 기회도 적을 거고.” 그의 말은 사실이었다. 세계적 3대 영화제 중 으뜸인 칸 영화제엔 헐리웃 포함, 여러 국가의 명망 높은 수많은 영화인들이 참석한다. 그러나 호명되어 무대에 오르는 것은 극소수. 강우진은 별수롭지 않게 답했다, 에둘러 말하는 것과 같았다. “압니다, 그저 미리 해본 겁니다.” “······” 재밌는 건 잠시간 강우진을 묘하게 바라보던 류정민이 대뜸. “아, 그냥 인사말이 아니라.” 픽 하고 웃는다는 것. “수상 소감을 준비한 거네, 안 될 리가 없으니까.” 불어로 된 착각이 생성됐다. < 역대 (16) > 끝","output":"< Chronicles (16) > Behold, this is my pocket dimension! It was a vehement exclamation spreading through Kang Woojin's mind, which was filled with a deepening smile. In the past, he might have been slightly flustered, but now... \\"Sweet.\\" The current Woojin was enjoying the gift of the pocket dimension. So French? Yes, French. Honestly, had Kang Woojin ever had a reason to speak French in his life? No, probably not if it weren't for the pocket dimension. \\"I wouldn't have even thought about it until I died.\\" He might have been okay with English or Japanese since he heard them often around him, but French was an unfamiliar language. However, Kang Woojin's excitement level kept rising. \\"There must be some use for it somewhere, right? It's a total win to acquire a language this easily!\\" Kang Woojin could potentially possess all the languages in the world. Well, he might not use them every day, but just having them imprinted in his mind was exciting enough. At this point, in the dark pocket dimension, Woojin saw the familiar, endlessly vast grey. The grey engulfed Kang Woojin. Woojin smiled. He thought for a brief moment. In the near future. \\"Ah- right, French. I could use it if I go to the Cannes Film Festival.\\" He thought of a stage where he could use French. How much time had passed? The conference room of bw Entertainment began to get busier. Not only the team leaders from each department but also the staff of the actors started to appear. They were all from the same company, but since it was hard to see each other's faces, they were busy greeting one another. In the meantime. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" Two of bw Entertainment's leading actors, who had already taken their seats, were for some reason silent. Kang Woojin and Hong Hye-yeon. Woojin was quietly looking at the script she had handed him, and Hong Hye-yeon, with her long hair swept back, narrowed her eyes slightly as she watched him. 'What's this, I'm getting nervous. Why isn't he saying anything?' Woojin was usually reticent, but he had become even more composed after looking at the script. Hong Hye-yeon was quietly tense. Although she pretended not to care due to the many eyes around, she couldn't take her eyes off Woojin. At that moment. -Flip. Kang Woojin, who had been subtly hesitating, turned a page of the script he was looking at. His expression remained solemn. Hong Hye-yeon, who was contemplating, wondered if she should just ask. But she didn't speak up after all. Yet, she thought. '...But if Woojin says it's not good, should I not do it?' She quite liked the project. However, what if Kang Woojin firmly and lowly said, \\"It's not interesting\\"? Should she pass on it then? Suddenly, she shook her head slightly. 'No. I can't rely on expectations.' Kang Woojin's intuition and animalistic sense were certainly phenomenal. There had been many proofs in the past, and every project he had been involved in had been a huge hit. It had gone beyond the point of trust; it was a religion. Listening to Kang Woojin's words would definitely be better. But relying on him too much could lead to bad habits. At least that's what Hong Hye-yeon thought. 'I'll just take it as a reference. Even if he says it's trash, if I think I should do it... that's the right thing to do.' It was then that Kang Woojin's voice, slightly cold in tone, was heard. \\"Thank you.\\" \\"Ah, really? Is it fun... huh? Wait. Thank you? For what?\\" Hong Hye-yeon, with a puzzled look on her face, asked back, and Kang Woojin replied nonchalantly. \\"Just because.\\" \\"Eh?\\" \\"And this script, it's not bad.\\" \\"You jump from 'thank you' to 'it's not bad'?\\" \\"Should I change the order for you?\\" \\"What's the difference?\\" \\"You'll know if you hear it.\\" This man, really. As always, she felt swayed when talking to Kang Woojin, and she bit her lower lip slightly. At the same time, Hong Hye-yeon snatched the script from Woojin's hand and cleared her throat. \\"Ahem! Anyway. I'm also thankful that you looked at it.\\" Kang Woojin, recalling the French that had been imprinted on him, recited honestly. \\"I can do this much anytime.\\" The next day, the 7th, Monday. The hectic weekend had passed, and the weekday dawned. It was around 7 a.m. Although it was early in the morning, Kang Woojin had just left the salon. His hair was slicked back, and his makeup was already done. The reason was simple. 'I have a full schedule today too.' He had a busy schedule that required him to move around from early in the morning. Although most of Sunday was spent filming \\"Leech,\\" today he only needed to join around a little after noon. Instead, his schedule was packed between morning and lunch. \\"Woojin!\\" Choi Seonggeon with a ponytail waved from a large van parked in the salon's external parking lot. He had been away for a few days due to company work and was not there this morning either, but now he had returned. \\"Haha, did you miss me? I missed your stiff face when I didn't see you for a few days.\\" Choi Seonggeon, who had patted the poker-faced Woojin's shoulder a couple of times, gestured for him to move. Soon, Kang Woojin's van, filled with several staff members, left the salon. As the van began to drive on the road, Choi Seonggeon, who had stretched out, turned to Kang Woojin and said. \\"First, we're going to Eoullim Film Company.\\" Eoullim Film Company, which had turned the Korean film industry upside down with \\"Island of the Missing.\\" The reason Woojin was heading to Eoullim Film Company in Sangam-dong this morning was simple. \\"The audience will be shocked.\\" Kang Woojin, who had returned in triumph, was starting to provide support for the post-promotion of \\"Island of the Missing\\" from today. For that purpose, everyone, including Kang Woojin, decided to gather at Eoullim Film Company first. Then, Choi Seonggeon, who had been explaining for a while, took out his phone and changed the subject. \\"Japan, well, it's even more chaotic there without you.\\" It was about Japan, where Kang Woojin was absent. \\"Even if we intentionally spread it, and the film company and distributor of 'Nakigoe' start spinning it, it's several times noisier than expected.\\" It was true. Even the Japanese media, as if crying out for Kang Woojin to return, were informing Japan of the real-time performance of Korea's film \\"Island of the Missing.\\" Not only that? The currently in full editing \\"Nakigoe\\" and \\"Male Friend: Remake\\" were also crazily derived. Furthermore. 『One of the leads of 'Nakigoe', 'Uramatsu Mihuyu', \\"Planning to be a guest on Kang Woojin's sub-character channel and excited to visit Korea\\"』 Interviews with Japanese actors who had experienced Kang Woojin, appearances on variety shows, and more were snowballing significantly. At the center was always Kang Woojin. The more Woojin's activities expanded, the greater his influence on the Japanese entertainment industry became. His name couldn't help but rise and fall. Actors, voice actors, directors, PDs, staff, and numerous other figures scattered throughout the Japanese entertainment industry. Recently, a variety of emotions were particularly mixed among them. Check, envy, expectation, jealousy, admiration, disdain. Proof of this was very easy to find. For example, Mana Kosaku, who had recently finished filming \\"Nakigoe\\" and was taking a short break. A Japanese actor who played detective Yoshizawa Mochio in \\"Nakigoe.\\" He, who had exchanged the most lines with Woojin, was now at a social gathering. His origin was a famous Japanese band, but the social gathering he attended was formed only of top Japanese actors. Roughly a dozen people. Here, Mana Kosaku was. \\"If you guys act with Kang Woojin, you'll feel it too, he's an actor from another country, but there's a lot to learn from him. It's a pity he's a Korean actor.\\" He was praising Kang Woojin to the point of dry mouth. It wasn't a strange sight. Kosaku had felt awe several times from Woojin during the filming of \\"Nakigoe.\\" However, it was hard to express that in words. That's why he was eagerly sharing his experiences and praise. \\"Now, the Japanese acting scene needs to change. When he comes to the surface, many actors will awaken.\\" However, most of the top Japanese actors gathered at this social gathering did not share Kosaku's sentiment. More than half had been looking at him with disdain from the start. Why does he keep annoyingly bringing up his name? That kind of expression. Eventually. \\"Hey, Kosaku.\\" A Japanese actor sipping whiskey blurted out his frustration. \\"Aren't you sucking up to Kang Woojin too much? It's getting tiresome.\\" Several male and female actors nodded and joined in. \\"Exactly. It's already uncomfortable enough with all the media and public noise about that Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Stop it, Kosaku. What do we have to learn from that actor?\\" \\"Even if there is something to learn, we learn from the great seniors, not from a Korean actor who's only been in the business for two years.\\" As a result, the rest of the actors showed similar reactions. Among them, the actor who first showed annoyance asked Mana Kosaku again, frowning. \\"Kosaku. You're one of Japan's top actors. I don't know what you're fascinated by about Kang Woojin, but it looks a bit pathetic. Have you lost your pride?\\" Pride? Mana Kosaku, who was picking up a piece of watermelon from the fruit snacks, almost burst into laughter. In fact, he did let out a slight chuckle. \\"Keke, pride? Pride, huh-\\" He then scanned the Japanese actors looking at him, their faces full of discomfort. Ah, I see. Kosaku had a sudden intuition. \\"It will take a long time to change.\\" The Japanese acting scene. No, it would take too long for the rotten water to be purified, and he realized he had been swimming in it. But after seeing Woojin, he had awakened. \\"Why was I even here? I was blind too. Now I understand what Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro said.\\" The surrounding Japanese actors furrowed their brows even more at his muttering. \\"What? What's Kosaku mumbling about by himself?\\" \\"Hey, don't ruin the mood, let's just drink.\\" But Mana Kosaku simply stood up from the sofa without much response. Then he spoke softly to the Japanese actors holding their glasses. \\"You're all stuck in this narrow puddle. So you think this is everything. If you don't flail and look up, you'll rot, giving off a stench.\\" \\"What, what?! Hey!!\\" Kosaku, who locked eyes with the first Japanese actor to get annoyed, remembered the last scene of \\"Nakigoe\\" with Kang Woojin that had sent shivers down his spine and smiled. \\"Genjiro, you may never act with Kang Woojin, but let me tell you one thing.\\" \\"......What?\\" \\"I wasn't comfortable with Kang Woojin from the start either. I even wanted to break his proud nose.\\" \\"And then?\\" \\"It's a meaningless act.\\" Kosaku's smile deepened. It was a smile filled with many meanings. \\"Pride or whatever, it's no different from trash in front of Kang Woojin.\\" Kosaku then left the room where the social gathering members had gathered. As he slowly walked down the corridor, he murmured softly. \\"If the mental state of the actors is like that - 'Nakigoe's release will really be something to see.\\" Meanwhile, in Korea. Eoullim Film Company in Sangam-dong. The van carrying Kang Woojin stopped in the parking lot of the film company. Kang Woojin got out immediately. His outfit for the day was a thin white shirt with jeans. Then the team members, including the stylist, stayed in the van, and only Woojin and Choi Seonggeon moved to the elevator. They arrived on the 3rd floor. -Ding! As soon as the elevator doors opened, Choi Seonggeon turned right along the corridor. On the other hand, Kang Woojin moved to the left. He then spoke to Choi Seonggeon in a low tone. \\"I need to use the restroom.\\" Choi Seonggeon, who was retying his ponytail, gave a thumbs up. \\"Okay- I'll go ahead and set up the place.\\" \\"Yes, Mr. President.\\" Woojin replied briefly and moved with a calm step. \\"......\\" His face was stiff all the way. No change. He opened the glass door to the restroom. Kang Woojin looked inside. There was no one. \\"Huh.\\" For a brief moment, a smile crossed Woojin's lips as he spoke. However, this time, what poured out of his mouth was not Korean. [\\"Je suis Kang Woojin, et je suis un acteur coréen.\\"] It was the already imprinted French. It was still amazing to use. It was fluent as if he had been speaking it all his life. If his face was covered, no one would think it strange to assume he lived in France. 'The pronunciation is really unique, seriously.' Unlike English or Japanese, there was a peculiar pleasure. Thanks to that, Woojin, after relieving himself, washed his hands while uttering other French phrases. [\\"What's for lunch today, I hope it's meat.\\"] The food truck on the set of \\"Leech\\" boasted top-notch flavors. If meat was served when he arrived at the set in a few hours for lunch... French flowed out without any hesitation. Kang Woojin, with a smile on his lips, shook the water off his hands. At that moment. -Swish. The glass door to the restroom opened. Woojin quickly put on his concept act and turned around at the sound. The man who opened the restroom door was a handsome man. No, it was the top actor Ryu Jungmin, wearing a green knit short-sleeve shirt. He had also arrived at the film company for the same reason as Kang Woojin. What was peculiar was that his pupils were quite dilated. \\"Woojin.\\" Ryu Jungmin, standing nonchalantly, took a step towards Woojin and said. \\"......I overheard from outside. It was French, right? Don't tell me you can also speak French?\\" It was an unexpected situation, but Kang Woojin, with an indifferent face, reacted calmly. In other words, he beat around the bush. \\"No. I was just practicing some greetings.\\" \\"Greetings?\\" A film festival flashed through Woojin's mind. It was something he had thought of just before French was imprinted in the pocket dimension. \\"Yes, the Cannes Film Festival.\\" The Cannes Film Festival. Well done, it was natural. If he said he was practicing light greetings for the Cannes Film Festival, that would suffice. There was no need to hide the fact that French was imprinted, but there was also no need to reveal it now. It would just be bothersome. On the other hand, Ryu Jungmin blinked his eyes as if it was even stranger. \\"Cannes? Cannes- is still months away, and you don't need to prepare greetings in French since there will be interpreters. Besides, unless you're going on stage to receive an award... there will be few opportunities to greet.\\" His words were true. At the Cannes Film Festival, the pinnacle of the world's three major film festivals, many prestigious filmmakers from various countries, including Hollywood, attend. However, only a handful are called to the stage. Kang Woojin replied nonchalantly, as if speaking evasively. \\"I know, I just tried it in advance.\\" \\"......\\" The interesting thing was that Ryu Jungmin, who had been looking at Woojin strangely for a moment, suddenly. \\"Ah, it's not just a greeting.\\" He chuckled. \\"You're preparing an acceptance speech, aren't you? Because there's no way you won't win.\\" A misunderstanding in French was created. < Chronicles (16) > End"},{"instruction":"主题曲《人世间》还浓缩了青年叙事的“成长母题”。改写","output":"主题曲《人世间》不仅呈现了世俗生活中的种种亲情、友情和爱情，还贮藏了青年叙事中的“成长母题”。我们可以将其改写成以下版本： 在这喧嚣的世界中，我们都是成长的旅人，脚步匆匆，不停地追寻着梦想的脚印。年少时的我们，带着无尽的热情和青春的鲜活，踏上了自己的生命之旅。 曾经，我们怀揣梦想，信心满满地向前奔跑。那些无忧无虑的岁月里，我们跳跃在青春的音符上，以为生命会一直如此灿烂。然而，成长的路上并非常马虎，我们不得不经历各种挫折和磨难。 有时，迷茫笼罩着我们，梦想变得模糊不清。我们开始思考人生的价值，追问自己真正的追求是什么。在痛苦和无助中，我们慢慢明白，成长并不仅仅是岁月的累积，更是探索内心世界的过程。 在这个过程中，我们渐渐与周围的人相遇，他们给予我们支持和力量。亲情的温暖、友情的陪伴、爱情的滋润，这些都成为我们成长路上的财富。我们学会了珍惜与他们的相遇，感激他们对我们的付出。 而如今，我们已经不再是年少的模样，肩上承载着更多的责任和压力。但是，我们明白生活中的每一个挑战都是一个成长的机会。我们不再害怕失败，因为我们知道失败不是终点，而是下一次奋斗的起点。 年轻的我们，用梦想的火焰燃烧起岁月的书页。虽然有时会迷失，但我们坚信自己的内心，奔跑着，舞动着，创造着属于自己的成长之路。 这首新版本的《人世间》将更加突出青年成长的主题，以更加深刻的方式表达了一个人在成长的道路上所经历的挫折、坚持和成长。"},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[“······”] ‘낯선 이’ ‘이요타 키요시’였다. 여기까지 읽은 아카리 작가가 잠잠한 얼굴로 쿄타로 감독에게 작게 물었다. “이 결말을······우진씨가 제의했다는 거죠?” < 역대 (1) > 끝","output":"< Chronicles (1) > As soon as he heard Kang Woojin's comments, Director Kyotaro began to mutter phrases like 'stranger' or 'someone who ignores all causality'. It was as if he was talking to himself. Watching Director Kyotaro become serious as he stroked his chin, Woojin remained silent. \\"......\\" He didn't react outwardly, but inside he felt a bit intimidated. 'Did it work? Or not? What is it, which one is it?' He cursed inwardly as if he didn't care, but this was the first time he had ever done something like this. Even after suddenly becoming an actor. However, he would have regretted it if he hadn't spoken up. That was Kang Woojin's true intention. The ending of a work could possibly determine the rise and fall of the overall performance. In other words, if the ending of 'The Stranger' changes as Kang Woojin suggested, the rating could change. -[7/Scenario (Title: The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger), SS Rank] It's currently SS rank, but it could fall to A rank or even, god forbid, B rank. Well, it could be the opposite too. 'If the ending doesn't change, there's nothing I can do.' It's okay if the rating drops a bit. Or is it not okay? 'But still, does it feel like something- Kiyoshi is saved?' Even if the rating of 'The Stranger' drops, Kiyoshi will be saved. Woojin felt that was good enough. The reason wasn't clear at all. It was just a feeling. Unbeknownst to him, this was the greed of an actor. Something similar to not wanting to ruin the character? Kang Woojin, who didn't realize he was growing. He spoke to Director Kyotaro, who was deep in thought right in front of him. \\"I know that a different ending from the original might upset the fans of the original work, but I still wanted to mention it. It seemed like Kiyoshi was being ruined.\\" He even took care of pretending to be a big shot in the midst of this. Why? Because this line was no different from directly challenging the world-famous writer Akari. 'It's tough, really tough. Pretending to be strong is like walking on thin ice every day.' On the other hand, Director Kyotaro, full of gray hair, was silent for a moment and then slowly nodded. \\"......I understand what you're saying.\\" Then he took out the shooting script and pen that had been tucked in his back pocket. He began to write something in the blank space. He was noting down a brilliant idea. At the same time, Director Kyotaro thought. 'This could be, no, definitely is a gamble. It will 100% draw complaints from the hardcore fans of the original.' Or it could even draw massive criticism from the entire Japanese content market. Because it's an act of blatantly breaking the cliché of 'karma'. Many in the public and the Japanese entertainment industry will be negative. 'Especially in Japan, change is poison.' To be precise, there's a strong aversion to anything new. That's why Japanese actors have been performing standardized, screaming acting for decades. Movies and dramas also continue to maintain similar plots. To put it crudely, they hit the average mark. The plots of powerful Japanese animations are the same. However, since the manga market, which is the basis of animation, is somewhat creative, animation evolves. On the other hand, the rest of the content market stagnates. Yet, every year it's the same. It doesn't improve. 'It's already ruined.' Japanese dramas and movies have reached the point where they mainly consist of live-action adaptations of anime and manga. They've long been left behind by Korea. Just look at the global phenomenon of the Korean Wave. Meanwhile, Japan still relies on the domestic market. Because they fear change. Director Kyotaro remembered the initial significance of 'The Stranger'. It was about delivering a blow to this stupid market. The acting of Japanese actors, the atmosphere of the market, the rigid flow of money, the directors who are afraid, and many others. Kang Woojin was chosen as the hitman for them. His monstrous acting, placing a Korean actor at the center of a work by the world-famous Japanese writer Akari, was an attempt to create a reversal. And now, Woojin was trying to overturn even the ending of 'The Stranger'. But Director Kyotaro was positive. 'Yes, if we're going to do it, we should do it right-' He was ready to take the lead. 'Kiyoshi will shine more if we go as Mr. Woojin suggested.' He imagines the bombardment. No matter how fierce the war that breaks out. \\"......Alright, I got it. Let's take a break. 5 minutes. No, 10 minutes.\\" Director Kyotaro, who spoke in Japanese, turned around while still writing something on the script, and then took out his phone. He was probably calling writer Akari, but Woojin didn't think much of it. 'Well, is it done? I've said all I had to say.' Soon, the assistant director shouted across the set, '10-minute break!!' or something like that. The staff of about a hundred people were puzzled by the sudden break called right after shooting began, but they quickly started moving their hands and feet to prepare for the next cut. In the meantime, as Kang Woojin was leaving the set, Japanese actors approached him. For some reason, they all gave him a thumbs up. \\"Congratulations, Mr. Woojin.\\" \\"I saw the article and was like, 'Wow!' I'm shocked! I've never even experienced those audience numbers!\\" \\"Congratulations. It's a rare result in Japan, so I'm envious but also impressed.\\" What? Why are they suddenly congratulating me? At first, Woojin wondered what they were talking about, but then a lightbulb went off in his head. Ah, 'The Island of the Missing'! At that moment, Choi Sunggun with a ponytail joined Woojin's side. With a smile, he whispered into Kang Woojin's ear. \\"'The Island of the Missing' has 700,000 viewers. It's tied with the first-day performance of the number one movie in Korean history.\\" \\"···Is that so?\\" Kang Woojin asked coldly, but inside he was screaming. 'Crazy??!!! 700,000 in one day??!! That's insane!!' At the same time. For some reason, the Japanese media was throwing out news about a Korean movie. 『'The Stranger' Kang Woojin's starring movie 'The Island of the Missing', attracts 700,000 viewers in Korea in just one day』 It's not a small number. But compared to the current state of Korea, it was just a drop in the bucket. At this time in Korea. 『[Movie Ranking] \\"It's crazy!\\", 'The Island of the Missing' takes first place with 700,000 viewers on its opening day』 『Truly a masterpiece by director Kwon Ki-taek!

Subsequently, from the late afternoon of the 20th, various media also joined in. News, radio, and many other places discussed the winner of this 'movie war'. It might be an overreaction. After all, it's only been one day. Regardless, the movies that lost to 'The Island of the Missing' were like a house of mourning. \\"700,000 in one day. Was that still a possible score?\\" \\"I, I can't believe it either. But let's hope! Maybe there will be a reversal tomorrow!\\" \\"What reversal? Have you seen the ratings and public reaction to 'The Island of the Missing'? Do you think it will sink easily?\\" \\"......\\" \\"It's a defeat. Sigh- we have no choice but to hit the BEP.\\" Moreover, there were those who were determined. \\"Don't hang your head! The more this happens, the more we need to step up the promotion!\\" \\"Ah, understood!\\" \\"It's not about beating 'The Island of the Missing'! People won't just watch that! Aim for second place and you might turn things around at the last minute! Get a grip!\\" Is there opportunity in crisis? Many movies aiming for the peak season were planning a counterattack. Movies that opened earlier than 'The Island of the Missing', those that opened on the same day, and all upcoming movies were doing so. However, that hope was shattered on the 21st, a day later. 1. The Island of the Missing/ Release date: May 19/ Viewers: 715,005/ Screens: 1159 / Cumulative viewers: 1,415,228 Not only did it lead the pack, but 'The Island of the Missing' surpassed 1.4 million viewers in just two days. Currently, Kang Woojin in Japan was facing a slight crisis with his concept. 'Two days, 1.5 million!! Wow- shit, this is crazy! Even when I was a drug dealer, I thought it was insane!!!' 'Drug dealer' was also astounded by the sight he had never seen before, but now the scale was several times larger. It felt unreal. Meanwhile, his phone was bombarded with contacts from numerous people. His phone was exploding. In addition, word of mouth about 'The Island of the Missing' also exploded. The result was announced on the morning of the 22nd, Saturday, which showed the results of Friday, the third day. 1. The Island of the Missing/ Release date: May 19/ Viewers: 865,448/ Screens: 1159 / Cumulative viewers: 2,280,676 Over 700,000 viewers, more than 800,000. Cumulative viewership surpassed 2 million in just 3 days. This was the moment when 'The Island of the Missing' first toppled the stronghold of the number one movie 'Sea Battle'. 『[Movie Talk] The all-time number one 'Sea Battle' had 2.1 million on its third day, the challenger 'The Island of the Missing' has 2.28 million... The tables have turned!』 At this time. Late in the morning, Japan's TOP3 animation studio 'A10 Studio' was in the midst of a big event. Specifically, the entire team of 'Boyfriend: Remake' was doing so. \\"Oh-\\" \\"It's well made.\\" \\"The effects and 3D are very clean.\\" \\"Even without the OST and sound, it's promising.\\" Dozens of people gathered in a medium-sized studio, speaking Japanese. They were the team of 'Boyfriend: Remake' and the executives of 'A10 Studio'. And on the large and small monitors in front of them, an animation was being displayed. Among them, the male character looked familiar. He resembled Kang Woojin a lot. The reason was simple. \\"The characters are all charming. Above all, the male lead character is great, it was the right decision to model it after Mr. Kang Woojin.\\" What they were watching was the animation 'Boyfriend: Remake', adapted from Korea's 'Boyfriend'. Moreover, it wasn't the first episode. It was the 12th episode. In other words, the test of the last episode. Excluding the post-production work such as dubbing and sound or mixing, and only displaying the video, the eyes of those watching the animation were filled with anticipation. It was worth it. Recruiting Korean actor Kang Woojin as a voice actor. Adapting the original drama and several other challenges were included in the life-threatening 'Boyfriend: Remake', and from episode 1 to 12, it was a completed moment. An incredibly fast pace of about half a year. Operating 4 teams was a stroke of genius. Now, the OP and EP, OST will be inserted. \\"Have the schedules for voice dubbing, sound, and OST recording been set?\\" \\"We're coordinating, but we've got a rough outline.\\" \\"Good. Oh, what about Mr. Kang Woojin?\\" \\"We've been informed that he's in the latter part of filming 'The Stranger'.\\" \\"......Finally, the end is in sight.\\" It was ready to launch once the voices of the voice actors, including Kang Woojin, were added. Meanwhile, outside the set of 'The Stranger', in the parking lot. In the vast parking lot, among many vans, two familiar figures sat facing each other in the back seat of a white van. One was Director Kyotaro, full of gray hair. His expression was firm. \\"......\\" Opposite him sat the original author of 'The Stranger', Takikawa Akari. She was looking down at a few sheets of paper with her glasses perched on the tip of her nose. The pages were filled with text. -Falak. Naturally, it was handed over by Director Kyotaro. Specifically, the revised ending of 'The Stranger'. It was like a proposal that Director Kyotaro had created in a few days. Akari's confirmation was absolutely necessary for this. Akari, who was reading it, had an unreadable expression on her face. Neither expressionless nor smiling. The ending that Akari was reading about 'Iyota Kiyoshi' was after all his 'homework' was finished. It starts with the morning rush hour on the subway. The background of the ending written by Director Kyotaro was very ordinary and familiar. Not only Akari but everyone would think so. 'An everyday morning commute scene that can be seen anywhere. It's not unusual or shocking.' It's extremely quiet. The crowded crowd waiting for the subway. The office workers tired from commuting. They're all the same. Black or navy suits with no expression at all. At a glance, it's hard to tell who is who. Hundreds of people swarm into the subway. And they got off. They look like a massive movement of black ants. Maybe they're people churned out of a factory. They don't say anything to each other. Of course. They are 'strangers' to each other. The angle is from behind the hundreds of people climbing the stairs. Among the hundreds of strangers, one person stops and slowly turns his head back. One of the many strangers who returned to the starting point after finishing his 'homework' and living an ordinary life. [“......”] It was 'the stranger' 'Iyota Kiyoshi'. Having read up to this point, Akari, with a calm face, quietly asked Director Kyotaro. \\"This ending... Mr. Woojin suggested it?\\" < Chronicles (1) > End"},{"instruction":"< 역대 (5) > 오열하던 엎어진 자세 그대로인 강우진은 키요시를 벗어내자마자, 자신의 얼굴과 입가에 콧물과 침이 범벅이라는 걸 인지했다. ‘미친. 이거 얼마나 나온 거냐?? 탈수 현상까지 오겄네.’ 아니, 뭐 사실 말라비틀어진 오열 연기를 할 때도 알고는 있었지만 연기와 현실은 다르지. 콧물 좀 얼굴에 범벅됐다고 누구도 욕하지 않을 걸 알지만. ‘그래도 빈틈이 없는 게 낫잖아?’ 이건 컨셉질 포함 자기관리의 영역이었다. 굳이 오바떨 건 없지만, 이렇게 하나둘 놓기 시작하면 모든 포기가 쉬워진다. 강우진은 엎어진 채 다시 한번 스스로 강조했다. 방심은 금물. 덕분에 우진은 가만히 엎어진 채 콧물과 침들을 닦아 냈다. 경박스럽지 않고 의연하게 또는 부드럽게. 들썩거리는 것이 옅다. 이쯤 우진의 등 뒤의 스탭들의 박수소리가 들려왔다. -짝짝짝짝짝짝짝! 뭐냐? 갑자기 뭔 박수? 콧물 닦는다고 극찬을 하는 건 아닐 거고. 아마도 조금 전의 연기에 관한 박수겠지. 어쨌든 저 박수가 끝나기 전엔 일어나야 했다. 꽤 오랫동안 무릎을 꿇은 탓과 수분을 빼낸 탓에 우진의 힘이 많이 빠졌다. 그래도 어떻게든 콧물 등을 제거하는 것에 성공한 그가. -스윽. 언제 그랬냐는 듯 태연한 포커페이스를 얼굴에 장착한 채 스르륵 일어났다. 생각보다 오래 걸렸다. 다들 우진이 콧물 닦다가 일어났다는 걸 눈치챘을 것이다. 최소 강우진은 그리 생각했다. 이럴 때일수록 세상 뻔뻔한 철판이 중요하다. ‘몰라, 씨. 당당하게 걷기.’ 우진은 냉혹함을 평소보다 더 진하게 만들었다. 민망함을 조금이나마 중화시킬 반사적 행동이랄까? 이어 대강 바지를 털던 우진의 눈에 바로 보이는 일본 배우. 직전까지 시체였던 ‘츠즈키 이츠마’ 역을 맡았던 배우가 아직도 우진의 앞에 서 있었다. 그가 강우진과 눈이 맞았다. “······” “······” 잠시간 침묵한 채 서로 시선을 교환한다. 일본 배우는 초반보다 더 딱딱해진, 평소보다 컨셉질이 배가 된 우진의 얼굴을 보곤 확신했다. ‘······아직 감정 추스린 게 완벽하진 않아. 그래도 프로다, 이렇게나 빨리 본인으로 돌아오다니.’ 강우진은 속으로 움찔했다. ‘뭔데? 왜 그렇게 보는데요? 아직 내 얼굴에 콧물의 잔해가 남았냐??’ 서로 상충하는 속내가 충돌하는 가운데 일본 배우가 먼저 일본어를 뱉었다. 심히 심각하다. “감동했습니다. 연기나 그 이후의 자세도. 무리하지 않아도 됩니다. 충분히 시간을 가시셔도 돼요. 감정을 다 추스른 후에 움직이세요.” 이게 뭔 쌉소리지? ‘콧물이 아직 거기 턱 쪽에 남았습니다’ 따위의 대사를 생각했던 우진이었다. ‘근데 뭔 감동이고 감정을 추스려? 뭐라는 거야 이 양반.’ ‘이요타 키요시’의 모든 건 이미 진작에 강우진의 몸에서 사라졌다. 장착하고 빼는 것 하니만큼은 귀신같은 그였으니까. 하지만 저 일본 배우의 반응이 이상하다. “······” 우진은 시니컬함을 유지한 채 천천히 고개를 뒤쪽으로 돌렸다. 여러 카메라, 조명 등의 사이에 선 수십 스탭들이 보였다. 다들 진중한 얼굴들이다. 몇몇은 한 손으로 입을 막은 채 감격하기도 한다. 단 한 명의 얼굴에서도 ‘콧물’은 찾을 수 없다. 심지어. ‘대표님은 또 왜 저렇게 심각한데?’ 늘 붙어 다니는 꽁지 머리 최성건마저도 매우 단단한 표정이다. 강우진은 이 지점에서 확신했다. 이 향기, 이 분위기, 이 언발란스한 공기. ‘또또또 뭔가 멋대로 굴러갔구만.’ 오해 또는 착각. 어디선가 우진이 겪어봤던 상황과 일치했다. 뭐, 나야 개꿀이지. 강우진은 굳이 콧물을 내세우며 사태를 정정하지 않는다. 그는 프로가 확실했다, 컨셉질의 장인. -스으. 천천히 오른손으로 흑발을 쓸어 넘긴 강우진이 일본 배우를 보며 목소리를 세상 낮게 깔았다. “추스른 게 아닙니다.” “······그, 그럼?” “기억했습니다.” 순간, 일본 배우의 눈이 커졌다. 강우진의 극한의 쎈척이 먹혔단 소리였고, 우진은 차분히 인사한 뒤에 몸을 돌려 최성건에게로 걸었다. 도중에 여러 스탭들의 억제된 찬사와 격려 등이 들렸다. 물론, 우진은 적당히 낮게 답할 뿐이었다. 곧, 앞에 도착한 강우진에게 심각한 최성건이 물었다. “괜찮냐? 오열, 통곡 연기도 처음인데 그걸 통제하면서 해야 된대서 좀 걱정하긴 했다. 네가 워낙에 짙은 메소드적인 연기를 하니까. 근데 역시···너라도 방금 같은 연기는 썩 불편했지? 바로 회복이 안 될 정도로.” 아니요, 콧물을 닦았습니다. 라고 말은 못 하니 우진은 거만함을 택했다. “회복은 쉬웠습니다. 중요한 건 기억이죠.” “기억?” “예, 그래야 나중에 다른 것과 붙여서 써먹을 수 있으니.” “······미친놈.” “감사합니다.” 질린다는 듯 고개를 젓던 최성건이 이내 엄지를 세웠다. “근데 뭐, 씬은 진짜 죽여줬다. 이만한 연기는 진짜 너니까 살렸고 소화한 거지, 딴 배우였어 봐라 숱한 NG에 죽어났을 거다. 개봉하면 관객들 놀라 자빠지겠네.” 실제로 방금 우진이 보인 오열 연기, 눈물 연기 등 녹진한 감정이 필수인 연기는 힘들다. 특히, 배우가 씬을 소화하지 못하면 무수한 NG와 함께 리액션이 나온다. 가능하면 원샷원킬이 좋겠지만 그런 배우는 드물다. 아니, 없다고 봐도 된다. 강우진이기에 가능했고 해냈다. 당연히 몇 발 뒤에서 우진을 지켜보는, 썼던 모자 덕에 머리가 눌린 쿄타로 감독은. “······방금 컷이면 차고 넘치지.” 리액션을 외칠 생각이 전혀 없었다. 구도 변경도 없다. 자신이 본 것이 최고이며 최상이다. 그런 그가 나지막이 일본어로 읊조렸다. “때때로 감독은 배우를 기만할 때가 있어.” 이에 바로 옆에 있던 조감독이나 스탭들이 고개를 갸웃했고. “예?” 쿄타로 감독은 우진에게서 눈을 떼지 않고 계속 말했다. “배우의 연기가 부족함에도, 배우의 연기가 과할 때도, 배우의 연기가 어중간함에도, 나는 그들을 격려하고 OK 사인을 내릴 때가 그럴 때지.” 타협을 말하는 것이었다. 시장의 암묵적인 룰에 기대는. “그건 보기엔 별거 없지만, 사실 기만이고 기망이다. 저 위에서 배우를 내려다보고 있다는 착각, 더는 행동하지 않고 고장 나버린 멍청이에 불과하지. 그런 게 현장에선 꽤나 빈번해.” “아- 그렇습니다. 배우의 컨디션도 조절해야 하고.” “그런데 오늘 나는 그것과는 결 다른 타협이 있다는 것을 알았어.” “그, 그게 무슨.” “강우진씨. 그가 직전에 보여준 연기를···예술을 나는 판단할 수 없었다. 함부로 NG냐 OK냐 선택할 수 없는 것이었어.” 연기가 부족해서가 아닌, 아득함을 느끼는 연기기에 판단의 오류가 생긴다. 머리가 백지장이 된 탓에 내릴 수밖에 없는 타협. 쿄타로 감독이 발을 움직였다. -터벅, 터벅. 그리곤 강우진에게 붙어 진중하며 확고하게 말했다. “방금의 씬으로 인해, 영화를 보는 관객들에게 닿는 ‘낯기생’의 결말은 폭발할 겁니다.” 도화선이란 얘기였다. 뒤로. 24일 월요일의 촬영은 자정이 돼서야 마무리됐다. ‘낯기생’의 촬영 스케줄이 마무리에 치닫고 있기에 조금 무리하는 건 당연한 일이었다. 이어 다음날인 25일이 밝았다. ‘낯기생’의 크랭크업까지는 이제 3일 남짓. 하지만 강우진은 다급한 것 없이 25일의 ‘낯기생’ 촬영에 참여했다. 이른 아침부터였다. “액션!!” 현장의 호흡은 점차 가빠졌다. 쿄타로 감독이나 백여 명 스탭들의 기백도 증폭됐다. 어제의 강우진 연기를 봐서일지도 모르지. 뭐가 됐든 진행되는 촬영은 ‘이요타 키요시’의 숙제 뒤의 내용, 그리고 시나리오 전체의 빈틈을 채울 인서트 컷이었다. 그러면서도 강우진은. ‘워- 미친!!’ 쉬는 시간마다 티 안 나게 핸드폰을 들여다봤다. 한국은 현재 ‘실종의 섬’ 붐이 일어나고 있었고 하루마다 기사 폭탄이 터지는 중이었으니까. 그뿐인가? SNS나 너튜브도 ‘실종의 섬’이 점령했다. 그냥 ‘실종의 섬’이란 해일이 한국을 뒤덮었다 봐도 무방했다. ‘터진다! 이건 진심 사고 제대로 터질 듯!’ 속으로 흥분이 점철되던 우진은 촬영에 돌입하면 귀신같이 차갑게 변했다. 이날도 밤늦은 시간에 스케줄이 정리됐다. 다음날인 26일의 스탠바이 시각은 점심쯤. ‘낯기생’의 촬영은 마무리에 접어들었다고 나태하지 않았다. 도리어 몇 배는 더 긴박했다. 시간이 어떻게 녹는지 알아채기 힘들 정도로. 그렇게 이틀 뒤, 28일 금요일이 밝았다. 장소는 도쿄. 시간은 새벽녘 6시쯤. 보통이라면 많은 이가 하루를 시작할 시각이지만, 이미 바삐 움직이는 사람들이 있었다. ‘낯기생’ 팀이었다. 모인 곳은 최근 ‘낯기생’팀이 상주했던 대형 세트장. 그중에서도 야외 컷을 위해 꾸며진 공간. 각 인물들의 집이나 가게 등. 꽤 자주 이용하는 세트의 외부 모습이 지어졌다. 규모만 봐도 이 세트 공사에 많은 시간을 투자한 것이 쉽게 느껴졌다. 그 사이로. “조명 테스트합니다!!” “보고 있어요!” “조명 끝나고 카메라 갈게요!” “감독님! 이쪽 확인 좀 부탁드립니다!!” 백여 명 스탭들이 각자의 파트에서 분주하다. 물론, 오늘도 모자를 푹 눌러쓴 쿄타로 감독도 마찬가지. 동분서주. 이들이 촬영 세팅에 공을 들이는 세트는 2층으로 된 맨션이었다. 복도형 맨션이며 2층 끝쪽엔 철계단이 붙었다. 맨션의 외벽은 회색이지만 검은 때가 많다. 턱 봐도 오래된 느낌. 시나리오상 이 맨션은 ‘이요타 키요시’의 집이었다. 오늘 ‘낯기생’팀은 여러 컷을 찍을 예정이지만 두 가지 정도가 핵심이었다. 이 맨션에서의 키요시와 형사 모치오의 첫 대면, 그리고 장소를 이동해 찍는 ‘낯기생’의 바뀐 결말 씬. 그래서인지 백여 명 스탭들의 눈빛에 힘이 잔뜩 들어갔다. 아니, 정확하게는. “하하, 이런 날이 오기는 하는군.” “그러니까요. 크랭크인 한 게 어제 같은데.” “시원한 맥주가 마시고 싶어, 오늘 마지막 촬영에 뒷정리까지 끝내면 한 잔 시원하게 하자고.” “찬성!” 오늘이 ‘낯기생’의 마지막 촬영 날이라 그렇다. ‘낯기생’의 마지막 촬영 날이 도래했지만 마음이 풀어진 스탭은 단 한 명도 없었다. 원래도 그럴 테지만, 특히나 오늘 이 현장에는 많은 손님들이 몰려들 예정이었으니까. “촬영 잡힌 배우님들 말고, 이미 빠진 배우님들도 오신다고 들었는데 진짜예요?” “아아. 맞아, 말고도 영화사 쪽이나 배급사 쪽도 올 거야.” “와- 다 오는 거네요.” “아카리 작가님도 오신다고 들었는데?” “확실한 건 아니지만 요시무라 히데키 회장도 올지 몰라.” “에에에?? 정말로??” 대화를 나누는 스탭들의 예측만 들어보면 오늘 세트장은 여러 인물로 가득 찰 게 빤했다. 실제로 이 시각엔 많은 이들이 ‘낯기생’ 세트장으로 가기 위해 준비 중이었다. 방금 일어난 강우진은 물론이며. “아으- 개피곤. 그래도 뭐, 오늘이 마지막 촬영이니까. 근데 좀 아쉽긴 하네.” 우진과 연기할 형사 모치오 역의 마나 코사쿠, ‘낯기생’의 배우들, 원작자 아카리 작가, 그리고 히데키 회장까지. 모두가 ‘낯기생’의 마지막을 기대하고 있었다. 오늘 촬영의 스탠바이 시각은 아침 7시 30분. 시작은 강우진부터였고 그다음이 마나 코사쿠. 둘의 솔로컷 등의 촬영이 끝난 다음이, 오늘 올 손님들이 볼 촬영 씬이었다. 확실한 건 아니지만 아침 10시쯤이 되겠지. 그렇게 시간이 흘러. “강우진씨 오셨습니다!!” 세트장에 강우진이 배우 중 1등으로 도착했다. 포커페이스가 짙다. “어서 와요, 우진씨.” “안녕하세요, 감독님.” “컨디션이나 기분은 좀 어때요.” “평소와 같습니다.” “역시 그렇군.” 마지막 촬영이라는 것에 속으론 약간의 긴장은 서렸지만, 그럴수록 그의 컨셉질은 더욱 단단해졌다. 이어 몇십 분 후 강우진의 촬영부터 시작됐다. 그 사이 얼굴선이 짙은 마나 코사쿠가 도착했다. 준비와 촬영이 번갈아 진행됐다. 이윽고 9시쯤. 서서히 세트장으로 ‘낯기생’의 배우들이 등장했다. “안녕하세요!” “아아, 미후유씨 어서 와요.” 촬영 상 이미 사망한 ‘호리노치 아미에’ 역의 우라마츠 미후유를 포함한 여러 배우들. 당연히 모두 맡은 역이 죽었기에 이탈한 상태였다. 이미 백여 명 스탭들이 뛰어다니는 세트장이 점차 몇 배는 더 북적이기 시작했다. 영화사, 배급사 간부들도 속속 도착했으니까. 그리고 아침 10시가 됐을 무렵엔. “감독님, 역시나 크랭크업하는 날이라 세트장이 정신없네요.” “오셨습니까 작가님.” 타키카와 아카리 작가가 나타났다. 쿄타로 감독과 대화한 뒤 여러 배우들과 인사하는 그녀. 그중에서도 이미 키요시와 다를 게 없는 강우진과의 대화가 제일 길었다. “오늘 촬영 열심히 해요, 아닌 척했지만 기대하고 있어요. 이러면 너무 부담되나?” “아니요. 잘 부탁드립니다.” “나야말로.” 이쯤. “에에- 지, 진짜 왔어요! 저기!” 촬영 세팅 중이던 조명 팀 스탭 몇몇이 호들갑을 떨며 세트 입구 쪽을 가리켰다. 곧, 주변의 수십 스탭들의 시선이 움직였다. “······요시무라 히데키 회장- 정말로 왔네??” 비서를 대동한 히데키 회장이 마지막 손님이었다. < 역대 (5) > 끝","output":"< Chronicles (5) > Still in the position he had collapsed in, Kang Woojin, as soon as he finished his portrayal of Kiyoshi, realized that his face and the area around his mouth were smeared with snot and saliva. 'Crazy. How much did I let out?? I might even get dehydrated.' Well, he was aware of it even when he was doing the intense crying acting, but acting and reality are different. He knew no one would criticize him for having his face smeared with snot. 'But still, it's better to be flawless, right?' This was part of self-management, including maintaining his concept. There was no need to overdo it, but once you start letting go of things one by one, it becomes easier to give up on everything. Kang Woojin emphasized this to himself once more while still lying face down. Complacency is forbidden. Thanks to this mindset, Woojin quietly wiped away the snot and saliva while lying down. Not frivolously, but calmly and gently. The movement was subtle. At this point, he could hear the sound of clapping from the staff behind him. -Clap clap clap clap clap clap! What's this? Why the sudden applause? They wouldn't be praising him for wiping his nose. It must be applause for the acting he had just done. In any case, he had to get up before the clapping stopped. His strength had drained quite a bit due to kneeling for a long time and losing fluids. Nevertheless, having successfully cleaned himself up, he... -Swish. ...rose smoothly, as if nothing had happened, with a poker face back in place. It took longer than he thought. Everyone must have noticed that Woojin had gotten up after wiping his nose. At times like this, it's important to have the shamelessness of a thick face. 'I don't care, just walk confidently.' Woojin intensified his usual coldness even more. Perhaps it was a reflexive action to neutralize the embarrassment a little? Then, Woojin's eyes caught sight of a Japanese actor right in front of him. The actor who had just played the role of the 'dead' 'Tsuzuki Itsuma' was still standing in front of Woojin. Their eyes met. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" They exchanged glances in silence for a moment. The Japanese actor, seeing Woojin's face, which had become even stiffer than at the beginning and doubled down on his concept, was convinced. '......He hasn't fully regained his composure yet. But he's a pro, returning to himself so quickly.' Kang Woojin flinched inwardly. 'What? Why are you looking at me like that? Is there still a trace of snot on my face??' Amidst their conflicting inner thoughts, the Japanese actor spoke first, his tone serious. \\"I was moved. By your acting and your attitude afterward. You don't have to push yourself. Take all the time you need. Move after you've fully regained your emotions.\\" What the hell is he talking about? Woojin had expected something like 'You still have snot on your chin,' but... 'But what's this about being moved and regaining emotions? What is he talking about?' Everything about 'Iyota Kiyoshi' had already disappeared from Kang Woojin's body long ago. He was adept at putting on and taking off roles. However, the reaction of the Japanese actor was strange. \\"......\\" Woojin maintained his cynicism and slowly turned his head back. He saw dozens of staff members standing between various cameras and lights. All of them had serious faces. Some were even moved to the point of covering their mouths with one hand. Not a single face showed any sign of 'snot'. Even. 'Why is the boss looking so serious?' Even Choi Sunggun, who always followed him around with a ponytail, had a very firm expression. Kang Woojin was certain at this point. This scent, this atmosphere, this unbalanced air. 'Something has gone off on its own again.' A misunderstanding or a mistake. It matched a situation Woojin had experienced before. Well, it's all good for me. Kang Woojin didn't bother to correct the situation by highlighting the snot. He was a true pro, a master of maintaining his concept. -Swish. Slowly running his right hand through his black hair, Kang Woojin lowered his voice to a whisper as he looked at the Japanese actor. \\"I haven't regained anything.\\" \\"......Then, what?\\" \\"I remembered.\\" In an instant, the Japanese actor's eyes widened. Kang Woojin's extreme pretense had worked, and Woojin calmly greeted him before turning and walking towards Choi Sunggun. Along the way, he heard subdued praise and encouragement from various staff members. Of course, Woojin only responded modestly. Soon, the serious Choi Sunggun asked Kang Woojin, who had arrived in front of him. \\"Are you okay? It was your first time doing a crying and wailing scene, and I was a bit worried since you had to control it while acting. You tend to do deep method acting. But still... even for you, an act like that must have been quite uncomfortable, right? To the point where you couldn't recover immediately.\\" Since he couldn't say, 'No, I wiped my nose,' Woojin chose arrogance. \\"Recovery was easy. What's important is the memory.\\" \\"Memory?\\" \\"Yes, so I can use it later with other things.\\" \\"......You're insane.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Choi Sunggun, shaking his head as if he was fed up, soon gave a thumbs up. \\"But really, the scene was killer. Only you could have pulled off and digested such acting. Any other actor would have died from countless NGs. The audience will be shocked when it's released.\\" In reality, the crying and tearful acting that Woojin had just shown, which required deep emotion, was difficult. Especially if the actor can't digest the scene, it results in countless NGs and reactions. Ideally, one-shot-one-kill would be great, but such actors are rare. In fact, it's safe to say they don't exist. It was possible and achieved because it was Kang Woojin. Naturally, Director Kyotaro, who had been watching Woojin from a few steps back and whose hair was flattened by the hat he had worn, thought. \\"......That last cut was more than enough.\\" He had no intention of shouting for a reaction. No change in composition. What he saw was the best and the highest quality. He murmured quietly in Japanese. \\"Sometimes a director deceives an actor.\\" The assistant director and staff nearby tilted their heads in confusion. \\"Yes?\\" Director Kyotaro continued without taking his eyes off Woojin. \\"Even when an actor's performance is lacking, when it's excessive, when it's mediocre, I encourage them and give the OK sign.\\" He was talking about compromise. Relying on the implicit rules of the market. \\"It may not seem like much, but in fact, it's deception and fraud. The delusion that I'm looking down on the actor from above, nothing more than a broken idiot who doesn't act anymore. That's quite common on set.\\" \\"Ah, I see. We also have to adjust the actor's condition.\\" \\"But today, I realized that there's a different kind of compromise.\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"Kang Woojin. I couldn't judge the acting... the art he just showed. I couldn't rashly choose between NG or OK.\\" It wasn't because the acting was lacking, but because the acting made him feel so distant that he made a judgment error. A compromise that had to be made because his mind went blank. Director Kyotaro moved his feet. -Thud, thud. Then he approached Kang Woojin and spoke to him seriously and firmly. \\"Because of that last scene, the ending of 'The Stranger' that reaches the audience will explode.\\" He was talking about a fuse. Behind. The shooting on Monday, the 24th, ended around midnight. It was natural to push a little harder as the shooting schedule for 'The Stranger' was coming to a close. The next day, the 25th, dawned. There were only about three days left until the crank-up of 'The Stranger', but Kang Woojin joined the shooting of 'The Stranger' on the 25th without any urgency. It started early in the morning. \\"Action!!\\" The pace on set quickened. The spirit of Director Kyotaro and the hundred or so staff members also intensified. Perhaps it was because of Kang Woojin's acting the day before. Whatever the reason, the shooting that was underway was for the content after 'Iyota Kiyoshi's' homework and insert cuts to fill the gaps in the entire scenario. Even so, Kang Woojin was... 'Wow- insane!!' During breaks, he discreetly checked his phone. In Korea, there was a 'The Island of the Missing' boom happening, with a barrage of articles exploding every day. Not only that, but SNS and YouTube were also dominated by 'The Island of the Missing'. It was fair to say that a 'The Island of the Missing' tsunami had engulfed Korea. 'It's going to explode! This is seriously going to be a major incident!' Internally excited, Woojin turned cold as a ghost when he entered the shooting. That day too, the schedule ended late at night. The standby time for the next day, the 26th, was around noon. The shooting of 'The Stranger' was coming to an end, but the staff were not lax. Especially since many guests were expected to flock to the set today. \\"Are the actors who are scheduled to shoot coming, and even those who have already left are coming too? Is that true?\\" \\"Yes. That's right, and people from the film company and the distributors will be coming too.\\" \\"Wow- everyone's coming.\\" \\"Did you hear that writer Akari is also coming?\\" \\"I'm not sure, but Chairman Yoshimura Hideki might come too.\\" \\"Really??\\" Just listening to the staff's predictions, it was clear that the set would be filled with various people today. In fact, at this time, many were preparing to head to the set of 'The Stranger'. Including Kang Woojin, who had just woken up. \\"Ah- so tired. But well, today is the last day of shooting. It's a bit sad, though.\\" Mana Kosaku, who would act with Woojin as Detective Mochio, the actors of 'The Stranger', writer Akari, and even Chairman Hideki. Everyone was looking forward to the last day of 'The Stranger'. The standby time for today's shooting was 7:30 AM. It started with Kang Woojin, followed by Mana Kosaku. After their solo shots were finished, the next was the shooting scene that today's guests would see. It would probably be around 10 AM, but not certain. As time passed. \\"Mr. Kang Woojin has arrived!!\\" Kang Woojin arrived at the set first among the actors. His poker face was intense. \\"Welcome, Mr. Woojin.\\" \\"Hello, Director.\\" \\"How's your condition and mood?\\" \\"The same as usual.\\" \\"Of course.\\" Although he felt a bit of tension inside since it was the last shooting, his concept became even more solid because of it. A few dozen minutes later, the shooting started with Kang Woojin. In the meantime, Mana Kosaku, with his deep facial features, arrived. Preparation and shooting alternated. Around 9 AM. Gradually, the actors of 'The Stranger' began to appear on set. \\"Hello!\\" \\"Ah, Mihuyu-san, welcome.\\" Including Uramatsu Mihuyu, who played the role of 'Horinochi Amie' and had already 'died' in the shooting. Naturally, all of them had left since their roles had died. The set, already bustling with a hundred staff members running around, began to buzz even more. Executives from the film company and distributors also arrived one after another. And around 10 AM. \\"Director, as expected, the set is chaotic on the day of the crank-up.\\" \\"Has the writer arrived?\\" Writer Takikawa Akari appeared. After talking with Director Kyotaro and greeting various actors, her conversation with Kang Woojin, who was already indistinguishable from Kiyoshi, was the longest. \\"Work hard on today's shooting. I'm pretending not to, but I'm looking forward to it. Is that too much pressure?\\" \\"No, thank you for your consideration.\\" \\"Likewise.\\" At this point. \\"Eh- He really came! Look over there!\\" Some staff from the lighting team, who were setting up for the shoot, made a fuss and pointed towards the entrance of the set. Soon, the gazes of dozens of staff members shifted. \\"......Chairman Yoshimura Hideki- he really came??\\" Chairman Hideki, accompanied by his secretary, was the last guest to arrive. < Chronicles (5) > End"},{"instruction":"< 역대 (9) > 5인 소파 상석에 앉은 히데키 회장의 제안. 그 제안은 꽁지머리 최성건의 건너편 소파에 앉은 통역 직원을 통해 넘어갔고, 정확한 뜻을 이해한 최성건의 두 눈이 확장됐다. ‘해, 해외 지사??’ 살짝 당황하는 그. 충분히 그럴 만했다. 급작스러워도 너무 급작스러웠으니까. 히데키 회장은 현재 ‘낯기생’의 메인 투자자임과 동시에, bw 엔터의 든든한 뒷배이기도 했다. 물론, 카시히 그룹의 수장이 아닌 히데키 회장의 개인적인 힘이었다. 전권은 모두 최성건에게 맡긴 상태. 덕분에 히데키 회장은 때때로 최성건의 보고를 확인하는 정도가 다였다. 뭐, 알아서 잘 굴러가겠지 따위의 느낌. 이번엔 최성건이 일본에 있기에 직접 브리핑을 하러 왔는데, 돌연 히데키 회장이 처음으로 제안 또는 제의를 던졌다. bw 엔터의 해외 지사를 만들어보라는 것. 최성건은. ‘이 양반 급발진을 종잡을 수가 없네. 일단, 살짝 떠보지 뭐.’ 퍼뜩 정신과 자세를 바로잡았다. 왜인지 큰 게 올 것 같은 느낌에서였다. “······해외 지사라고 하심은- 어느 쪽을 말씀하시는 건지.” 어느 정도 일본어가 가능한 최성건이었지만, 정확한 뜻의 전달을 위해 한국어로 말했고 통역 직원이 히데키 회장에게 전달했다. 곧, 작게 웃던 히데키 회장이 거끌한 목소리를 냈다. “어디겠어요, 헐리웃이지.” “아.” 진심이다. 히데키 회장은 대충 말하고 있는 게 아니었다. 최소 최성건은 그리 생각했다. 히데키 회장의 주름진 입은 웃고 있으나 눈빛은 날카로웠으니. 이쯤 최성건은 머릿속으로 계산기를 두드리고 있었다. 상황 파악과 눈치 하나만큼은 수준급인 그였으니까. ‘가만있어 봐, 진심으로 하는 소리면 여기서 최대한 많은 것을 들어야 돼.’ 이미 한국의 사업확장은 탄탄하게 굴러가는 bw 엔터였다. 강우진, 홍혜연, 류정민 등 탑들이나 A급도 꽤 모였다. 신인들 쪽의 사업도 확장하는 중이다. 아마 현재 국내 엔터들 중 bw 엔터의 성장세가 가장 가파를 테지. 다만. ‘조금 빠른 감도 있어.’ 아직 국내의 사업들이 안정화된 건 아니었다. 이 상태로 해외까지 뻗어가면 어디선가 문제가 터질 가능성이 다분했다. ‘돈을 퍼준다면야 땡큐지만, 소화가 안 되면 그건 그것대로 탈이야.’ 물론, 언젠가는 분명 bw 엔터도 해외로 뻗어가야 할 테지만 당장은 힘에 부친다. 그럼에도 투자자의 돈을 마다하는 건 병신이다. 최성건은 일단 확답 정도는 받아두는 게 낫다 판단했다. 계약금. 아니면 돈은 받고 사업의 진행률은 좀 천천히 가져가도 된다. 이때. “그런데 당장은 조금 벅차겠지요?” 천천히 다리를 꼰 히데키 회장이 여유 묻은 일본어를 뱉었다. 역시나 히데키 회장도 잘 알고 있는 듯했다. 최성건이 가져온 보고서나 자료들을 보기도 했고, 뭣보다 그는 일본의 거대 그룹 카시히의 총수였다. 모르는 게 더 이상했다. “bw 엔터의 현 상황을 봤을 땐 해외보단 한국의 일을 견고히 하는 게 맞을 테고.” 최성건이 인정은 하면서도 가능성은 열었다. “예, 그렇습니다. 평소 보내드리는 결산들을 보시면 아시겠지만, 현재 bw 엔터는 한창 날개를 펼치고 있는 터라 무리할 필요는 없습니다. 허나 해외 지사를 두는 게 불가능하진 않습니다. 다급하게만 진행하지 않는다면요.” 통역을 들은 히데키 회장이 느지막하게 고개를 끄덕였고, 진중해진 최성건이 되물었다. “그런데 왜 갑자기 해외 지사 생각을 하셨는지 여쭤봐도 되겠습니까?” ‘낯기생’ 세트장에서의 강우진을 상기하던 히데키 회장이 답했다. “탑들을 꽤 영입했으니 그릇을 키워야지. 영역은 기업의 얼굴이기도 하니까. 뭣보다 강우진이 한국이나 일본에서만 첨벙댈 인물이 아니잖아요. 이미 헐리웃에서 입질은 시작됐고. 일본도 그래, 강우진이 다 닦아 놨으니 해외 지사를 시작으로 일본 지사까지 파생시켜야지요.” 강우진이라는 괴물이 앞장서서 우거진 산길을 뚫고 있다. 후발타는 우진의 영향력에 힘입어 편히 걷기만 하면 됐다. 그렇기에 어느 영역이든 시장을 휘젓는 슈퍼스타가 필요한 것. 히데키 회장이 말을 이었다. “‘낯기생’이 잘된다면 일본 지사부터 만들어도 문제없겠지. 그래도 역시 해외 지사가 먼저라고 생각해요. 강우진의 ‘거머리’, 마일리 카라와의 앨범 작업, 이미 거절했지만 헐리웃에서의 러브콜. 이미 그는 헐리웃에 눈도장을 찍은 셈이고 빠른 시일 안에 뻗어 나가겠지.” “이르면 내년이라도.” “‘거머리’가 칸에서 잘된다면 더 빠를 테죠. 내가 말한 해외 지사는 그 시기에 강우진이 헐리웃에서 지낼 터전을 만들어 두라는 겁니다. 당장은 겉치레라도 상관없어요. 하지만 헐리웃에서 활개 칠 강우진의 케어는 필수불가결, 추가로 그 와중에 소속사가 홍보가 될 테니 헐리웃에 구심점은 있어야 하지 않겠어요?” “음 확실히. 회사가 한국에 있는 것보단- 본사가 한국, 헐리웃이 지사인 그림이 더 화려한 감이 있죠.” “강우진의 폼도 챙겨야 한단 소리지.” 둘의 대화엔 강우진의 실패 따윈 존재치 않았다. 100% 헐리웃을 휘젓는 설계가 포함돼 있었다. 당연했다. 강우진은 이미 전초전으로 한국과 일본을 집어삼키는 중이니까. 이어 최성건이 옅게 미소를 머금으며 답했다. “해외 지사 건, 최대한 빨리 정리해보겠습니다.” 몇 시간 뒤, 늦은 점심. 한식당에서 배 터지게 식사를 마친 강우진은 현재 도쿄 도로를 달리고 있는 승합차 안이었다. 그가 가려는 목적지는 도쿄역 근방에 있는, 애니메이션 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 제작사 ‘A10 스튜디오’였다. 오늘 전체 성우의 첫 만남과 더불어 간단한 대본리딩이 있으니까. 실제 녹음은 며칠 뒤로 잡혔다. 어쨌든 강우진이 탄 승합차는 떠들썩했다. 분위기를 잡아줄 최성건이 없어선지 더 그랬다. 나름 싸늘한 한예정이 맥을 끊고는 있지만 이들의 흥분은 좀처럼 가라앉지 않았다. 뭐, 우진도 이해 못 하는 건 아니었다. ‘일본, 한국 할 것 없이 빵빵 터지고 있으니. 아 근데 내 얘기지?’ 배우의 스탭들은 맡은 아티스트가 잘 되는 게 곧 기쁨이니까. 배우가 잘 되면 스탭들의 필모가 딴딴해지는 것도 있었다. 현재 우진은 일본은 물론이고 한국까지, 더 나아가 온라인 세상에서도 괴물급이었다. SNS나 너튜브 채널을 말하는 것. 어느 영역 하나 빠짐이 없으니 기쁠 수밖에. 당연히 강우진의 속내는 날뛰고 있었다. 하지만 무던한 포커페이스가 더 중요하긴 했다. 솔직히 마음 같아서는 지금 당장 탭댄스를 춰도 모자랄 판이었다. 하지만 우진은 꾹 참는다. 반면. -우우웅. -우우웅. 강우진의 핸드폰은 참지 않았다. 아침부터 뭐가 울려대고 있었으니까. 아니, 근래 그의 핸드폰은 미친 듯 진동을 울려댔다. 숱한 연락이 도착하고 있었으니까. DM을 포함해 톡과 문자 등이 폭발한다. 불알친구들이 모인 단톡방에선 실시간 ‘실종의 섬’의 반응이나 성적을 던져대고 있었다. 이런 연락들로 인해 우진은 현재 일본에 있지만 한국에 있다는 착각이 들 정도였다. ‘이 새끼들은 일을 안 하나?? 꿀이야 아주.’ 도착한 연락들에 적당히 답장을 보낸 강우진이 포털사이트에 접속했다. 컨셉질을 위해 최대한 안 보려고 했지만 이번엔 궁금증이 그를 이겼다. 바로 보이는 어마무시한 이슈들. 여러 주제들이 범람하는 중에 가장 두드러지는 것은 역시나 파란을 일으키는 ‘실종의 섬’이었다. ‘와- 미친, 진심 언론 난리 났네.’ 강우진이 연예면에 빼곡한 기사들의 타이틀을 쭉 훑었다. 재밌는 것은 대부분 기사들의 업로드 시각이 몇 분 전이라는 것. 그만큼 홍수처럼 쏟아지고 있다는 얘기였다. 뭐 언론이 이 지경인데 커뮤니티 등의 여론은 안 봐도 비디오. -와 시밬ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ진짜 1위 영화 바뀌나??! -근데 그럴만한겤ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ난 오늘 실종섬 보고 왔는데 진심 황금시간대 아직도 싹다 매진임ㅋㅋㅋㅋ -화력 지리네;;; -재밌기도 하고 배우들이 연기를 졸라 잘함 특히 강우진이 진심 찐이더라 -미다스의 손x 강우진의 손o -아니 호들갑들 지리넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ난 씹노잼이었구만 -ㅇㅈㅈ지금 실종의 섬 거품 심함 -근데 우리나라 1등 영화 뭐임? -검색을 해 병시나 -↑영화 해전이 1등임 1670만이었나? 우리나라 전체 영화 통틀어서 1위 -헐ㄹㄹㄹㄹㄹ그걸 지금 실종섬이 넘길라 하는거임?? 근데 1670...졸라 쎄긴하네 -근데 강우진이랑 류정민은 진심 연타석 홈런이지 않냐? 특히 강우진 폼이 그냥 씹지림 -강우진 얘는 걍 작품 선택하는 거 신내림 받은듯 · · · 대중들의 입과 손가락이 쉴 새가 없다. 그렇게 서서히 ‘실종의 섬’은 1000만 관객수를 향해 돌진하는 중이었다. 『‘실종의 섬’ 이미 800만 돌파, ‘해전’ 기록 깨지기 직전···벌써 성적은 이틀 앞서는 중』 『[빅이슈]‘해전’ 大기록 넘을까?··· ‘실종의 섬’ 1000만 카운트다운』 『1000만 눈앞 ‘실종의 섬’, 한국의 역대 1위 영화 타이틀도 마찬가지!』 하지만 1000만에서 그칠 것 같지 않은 속력이었다. 한편, 한국 인천. 인천의 부둣가 중 화수부두 쪽. 다른 곳들과 비교해 규모가 작은 화수부두 근방엔 꽤 넓은 갯벌이 보였고, 반대편엔 작은 집들과 가게들이 다닥다닥 붙은 형태였다. 가게들은 나름 종류가 다양했다. 가정집, 음식점, 철물점 등등. 사이사이 골목길도 많다. 앞쪽에 난 도로는 비포장, 흙, 포장이 섞였다. 그곳에 수십 인파들이 몰렸다. 몇몇은 카메라를 걸고, 몇몇은 조명을 올리고, 몇몇은 테이블과 각종 오디오 기기를 내리고, 몇몇은 주변의 보이는 곳에 필요한 소품을 세팅한다. 그런 촬영터를 지나 갓길에 세워진 승합차나 미니 버스들까지. 턱 봐도 촬영팀이었다. 이때. “음-” 촬영터로 적당한 검은 니트를 입은 늙은 남자가 등장했다. 이 근방을 둘러보고 온 노장 안가복 감독이었다. 짧은 흰 머리에 주름이 가득한 얼굴은 여전했다. 아니, 어쩌면 주름이 더 짙다. 밤을 자주 지새워서 그렇다. 그런 그가 세팅이 한창인 곳을 바라보다가 옆에 선 조감독에게 지시했다. “저기 흙길 말이야, 굳이 평평하게 할 필요가 있나? 오히려 더 어색한데 내 눈에는. 저거 원상복구 시키지.” “아! 옙! 알겠습니다!!” 영화 ‘거머리’의 팀이 야외 촬영을 나온 참이었다. 안가복 감독을 지나 저 앞엔 탑배우 진재준이 메이크업 중이다. 아마 이번 씬은 진재준의 차례인 듯 보였다. 이어 여러 모니터가 세팅된 테이블에 앉은 안가복 감독이. -스윽. 작게 한숨을 뱉으면서도 테이블에 올려진 촬영 콘티를 집었다. 남은 촬영분은 얼추 30% 정도. 천천히 다리를 꼰 그가 나지막이 읊조렸다. “······중후반부- 조금 더 속력을 내야 되나.” 이미 지옥 같은 스케줄로 촬영을 진행하고 있지만, 안가복 감독은 여전히 촉박하다는 기분을 지울 수가 없었다. ‘며칠 지나면 벌써 6월이야.’ 다행히 촬영을 이으면서도 틈이 나면 후반 편집의 초벌 작업은 하고 있었다. 그러나 아무리 봐도 시간을 쪼개야 했다. 최소 영물 안가복 감독을 그리 생각했다. 이때. -♬♪ 안가복 감독의 핸드폰이 벨소리를 뱉었다. 상대는 ‘거머리’의 제작을 맡은 영화사 대표였고. “그래, 나야.” 핸드폰 너머로 영화사 대표의 약간 흥분된 목소리가 퍼졌다. “감독님, 방금 칸 쪽에서 공식 개막날 발표했습니다.” 2시쯤, 일본. 방금 일본 TOP3 애니 제작사 ‘A10 스튜디오’에 도착한 강우진이 승합차에서 내렸다. 근엄한 우진이 건물을 바라본다. ‘A10 스튜디오’의 건물은 여전히 거대했고, 입구 근방에 놓인 애니 캐릭터의 여러 동상이나 등신대들도 그대로였다. ‘아니, 몇 개가 추가됐나? 저기 여자 캐릭터는 처음 보는데?’ 어쨌든 강우진의 주변으로 팀이 붙었고 그가 발길을 뗐다. 더불어 약간의 긴장감이 솟았다. ‘일본 성우들이라- 보는 건 처음인데. 어떠려나?’ 곧, ‘남사친: 리메이크’에 참여하는 많은 성우들과 조우할 참이었으니까. 일본에선 애니메이션이 워낙 강대하기에, 한국과 달리 성우가 약간 연예인 취급을 받는다. 실제 인기 좋은 성우는 팬미팅이나 사인회도 열고 예능에도 출연한다. 그래도 강우진에겐 매우 낯설었다. 이 순간. -우우웅, 우우우웅. 우진이 움직이던 발을 멈췄다. 청재킷 속 주머니에 핸드폰이 긴 진동을 뱉었으니까. 전화였고, 강우진이 장수환 등의 스탭들에게 잠시라는 손짓을 한 뒤 발신자를 확인했다. ‘영물. 아니, 안가복 감독님이네?’ 전화 건 이는 안가복 감독이었다. 이내 단단한 얼굴로 핸드폰을 귀에 붙이는 강우진. “네, 감독님. 안녕하십니까.” 핸드폰 건너편에서 늙은 목소리가 울렸다. “그래요, 피차 바쁘니 핵심만 전달할까 해서 전화했어요.” “예 말씀하세요.” “칸 영화제 개막날이 확정됐어요, 9월 30일. 그로부터 10일간 진행될 거야.” 9월 30일 칸 영화제 개막. “그렇습니까?” 즉, 그쯤 강우진이 프랑스에 간다. < 역대 (9) > 끝","output":"< Chronicles (9) > Seated in the prime spot on the five-person sofa, Chairman Hideki's proposal was passed through an interpreter sitting opposite Choi Sunggun on the other sofa. Upon understanding the exact meaning, Choi Sunggun's eyes widened. 'Overseas branch??' He was slightly flustered, and rightly so. It was too sudden. Chairman Hideki was currently the main investor in 'The Stranger' and also a solid backer of BW Entertainment. Of course, it was the personal influence of Chairman Hideki, not as the head of the Kashihi Group. He had entrusted all authority to Choi Sunggun. Thanks to this, Chairman Hideki only occasionally checked in on Choi Sunggun's reports. It was a feeling like, 'Well, it'll probably roll along fine.' This time, since Choi Sunggun was in Japan, he came to give a direct briefing, but suddenly Chairman Hideki made his first proposal or offer. He suggested creating an overseas branch for BW Entertainment. Choi Sunggun thought, 'This guy's sudden acceleration is unpredictable. Let's test the waters a bit.' He quickly composed himself and his posture, sensing that something big was coming. \\"......By overseas branch, you mean- which region are you referring to?\\" Choi Sunggun, who could speak some Japanese, spoke in Korean for accurate translation, and the interpreter conveyed it to Chairman Hideki. Soon, Chairman Hideki, who had been smiling faintly, spoke in a gruff voice. \\"Where else but Hollywood.\\" \\"Ah.\\" He was serious. Chairman Hideki wasn't just speaking casually. At least that's what Choi Sunggun thought. Chairman Hideki's wrinkled mouth was smiling, but his eyes were sharp. At this point, Choi Sunggun was mentally running calculations. He was known for his exceptional situational awareness and intuition. 'Hold on, if he's serious about this, I need to get as much as I can out of this situation.' BW Entertainment was already rolling along solidly with its business expansion in Korea. Top stars like Kang Woojin, Hong Hye-yeon, and Ryu Jung-min, as well as several A-listers, had been gathered. The business for newcomers was also expanding. Probably, BW Entertainment's growth was the steepest among domestic entertainment companies. However, 'It feels a bit too soon.' The domestic businesses had not yet stabilized. Expanding overseas in this state could lead to problems somewhere. 'Thanks for the money, but if we can't digest it, that's a problem in itself.' Of course, BW Entertainment would eventually need to expand overseas, but it was too much to handle right now. Still, turning down an investor's money would be foolish. Choi Sunggun decided it was better to at least get a firm answer. A down payment. Or take the money and proceed with the business more slowly. At that moment, \\"But wouldn't it be a bit overwhelming to start right away?\\" Chairman Hideki, who had been leisurely crossing his legs, spoke in a relaxed Japanese tone. It seemed he was well aware too. He had seen the reports and materials brought by Choi Sunggun, and after all, he was the head of Japan's giant Kashihi Group. It would be strange if he didn't know. \\"Considering the current situation of BW Entertainment, it would be right to solidify work in Korea rather than go overseas.\\" Choi Sunggun acknowledged this but kept the possibility open. \\"Yes, that's correct. As you can see from the financial statements we regularly send you, BW Entertainment is currently spreading its wings, so there's no need to rush. However, establishing an overseas branch is not impossible. As long as we don't rush it.\\" After listening to the translation, Chairman Hideki slowly nodded, and Choi Sunggun, who had become serious, asked, \\"May I ask why you suddenly thought of an overseas branch?\\" Chairman Hideki, who had been reminded of Kang Woojin on the set of 'The Stranger', answered. \\"We've recruited quite a few top talents, so we need to expand our capacity. Territory is also the face of a company. Besides, Kang Woojin isn't someone who should only splash around in Korea or Japan. Hollywood has already started showing interest, and Japan too, since Kang Woojin has paved the way, we should start with an overseas branch and then derive a Japanese branch.\\" Kang Woojin, the monster, was leading the way through the dense forest. The followers would simply benefit from Woojin's influence and walk comfortably. That's why a superstar who can stir up any market is needed. Chairman Hideki continued, \\"If 'The Stranger' does well, we can start with a Japanese branch without any problems. But I still think an overseas branch should come first. Kang Woojin's 'Leech', the album work with Miley Kara, and although he declined, the love calls from Hollywood. He's already made his mark in Hollywood and will expand there soon.\\" \\"As early as next year.\\" \\"If 'Leech' does well in Cannes, it could be even sooner. The overseas branch I mentioned is about creating a base for Kang Woojin to stay in Hollywood. For now, even a facade is fine. But care for Kang Woojin, who will spread his wings in Hollywood, is essential, and in the meantime, the agency will get publicity, so it's necessary to have a focal point in Hollywood, right?\\" \\"Hmm, definitely. It's more glamorous to have the company in Korea and Hollywood as a branch.\\" \\"It's about taking care of Kang Woojin's image.\\" In their conversation, the possibility of Kang Woojin's failure did not exist. It included a 100% plan to stir up Hollywood. Naturally. Kang Woojin was already swallowing up Korea and Japan as a prelude. Then Choi Sunggun, with a faint smile, responded, \\"I'll sort out the overseas branch matter as quickly as possible.\\" A few hours later, late lunchtime. Kang Woojin, who had finished a hearty meal at a Korean restaurant, was now in a van driving through the streets of Tokyo. His destination was 'A10 Studio', the production company of the animation 'Boyfriend: Remake', located near Tokyo Station. Today was the first meeting of all the voice actors and a simple script reading. The actual recording was scheduled for a few days later. In any case, the van Kang Woojin was in was noisy. Perhaps even more so without Choi Sunggun to set the mood. Han Ye-jeong was trying to break the excitement, but their enthusiasm was hardly subsiding. Well, Woojin understood. 'Whether in Japan or Korea, everything is exploding. Oh, but it's about me, isn't it?' For the actors' staff, their artist's success is their joy. If the actor does well, the staff's filmography becomes more solid. Currently, Woojin was a monster not only in Japan and Korea but also in the online world. He was talking about SNS and YouTube channels. With no area left untouched, they had to be happy. Naturally, Kang Woojin's inner thoughts were racing. But maintaining a calm poker face was more important. Honestly, he felt like even tap dancing right now wouldn't be enough. But Woojin held back. On the other hand, -Vroom, vroom. Kang Woojin's phone did not hold back. It had been ringing since the morning. No, lately, his phone had been vibrating like crazy. Countless contacts were arriving. Including DMs, chats, and texts were exploding. In the group chat with his close friends, real-time reactions and performance of 'The Island of the Missing' were being thrown around. Because of these contacts, Woojin, currently in Japan, felt as if he was in Korea. 'Do these guys not work?? It's sweet.' After sending appropriate replies to the contacts, Kang Woojin accessed a portal site. He had tried his best not to look for the sake of maintaining his concept, but this time curiosity got the better of him. The overwhelming issues were immediately visible. Among the flood of various topics, the most prominent was 'The Island of the Missing', causing a stir. 'Wow- the media is going crazy.' Kang Woojin skimmed through the titles of the densely packed entertainment articles. What was interesting was that most of the articles had been uploaded just a few minutes ago. It meant they were pouring in like a flood. Well, if the media is like this, the public opinion on communities and such is obvious without even looking. -Wow, shitㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Is the number one movie really changing?? -But it's worth itㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I just saw The Island of the Missing today and seriously, even the prime time slots are still all sold outㅋㅋㅋㅋ -The firepower is insane;;; -It's not only fun, but the actors also act really well, especially Kang Woojin was genuinely top-notch -Midas's handx Kang Woojin's hando -Are you guys kiddingㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I found it utterly boring -ㅇㅈㅈ Right now, The Island of the Missing is overhyped -But what's the number one movie in our country? -Do a search, you idiot -↑The movie Sea Battle is number one with 16.7 million, right? It's the top of all movies in our country -Holyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Is The Island of the Missing really going to surpass that?? But 1670... that's really strong -But seriously, Ryu Jung-min and Kang Woojin are hitting back-to-back home runs, right? Especially Kang Woojin's form is just insane -Kang Woojin seems to have a divine gift for choosing projects · · · The public's mouths and fingers are non-stop. And so, 'The Island of the Missing' was gradually charging towards 10 million viewers. 『'The Island of the Missing' already surpasses 8 million, on the verge of breaking 'Sea Battle's record... already leading by two days』 『[Big Issue] Will it surpass 'Sea Battle's great record?... 'The Island of the Missing' countdown to 10 million』 『'The Island of the Missing' close to 10 million, aiming for the title of Korea's all-time number one movie!』 But the speed suggested it wouldn't stop at 10 million. Meanwhile, in Incheon, Korea. At the Hwasu Wharf in Incheon, compared to other places, the Hwasu Wharf area was small, with a wide mudflat visible, and on the opposite side, small houses and shops were tightly packed together. The shops were quite diverse. Family homes, restaurants, hardware stores, etc. There were also many alleys. The road in front was a mix of unpaved, dirt, and paved. Dozens of people had gathered there. Some were setting up cameras, some were raising lights, some were unloading tables and various audio equipment, and some were setting up necessary props in visible areas. Passing through the filming site, there were vans and minibusses parked on the side of the road. It was obviously a filming team. At that moment, \\"Hmm-\\" An old man in a simple black knit appeared at the filming site. It was the veteran director Ahn Ga-bok, who had looked around the area. His short white hair and face full of wrinkles were the same as ever. No, maybe the wrinkles were even deeper due to frequent all-nighters. As he looked at the busy setting, he gave instructions to the assistant director standing next to him. \\"About that dirt road, do we really need to flatten it? It actually looks more awkward to my eyes. Restore it to its original state.\\" \\"Ah! Yes! Understood!!\\" It was the team of the movie 'Leech' out for outdoor shooting. Passing by Director Ahn Ga-bok, top actor Jin Jae-jun was getting makeup done in the distance. It seemed like it was Jin Jae-jun's turn for this scene. Then, Director Ahn Ga-bok, who had sat down at a table set with various monitors, -Swish. Let out a small sigh but picked up the shooting script on the table. About 30% of the shooting was left. He crossed his legs slowly and murmured quietly, \\"......Should I speed up a bit for the second half?\\" Even though he was already on a hellish schedule, Director Ahn Ga-bok couldn't shake the feeling that it was still too tight. 'In a few days, it'll already be June.' Fortunately, while shooting, he was also doing preliminary editing work whenever there was a gap. But no matter how he looked at it, he needed to split his time. At least that's what the legendary Director Ahn Ga-bok thought. At that moment, -♬♪ Director Ahn Ga-bok's phone rang. The caller was the head of the film company in charge of producing 'Leech'. \\"Yes, it's me.\\" The film company head's slightly excited voice came through the phone. \\"Director, they just announced the official opening day for Cannes.\\" Around 2 PM, Japan. Kang Woojin, who had just arrived at Japan's TOP3 animation studio 'A10 Studio', got out of the van. The solemn Woojin looked at the building. 'A10 Studio's building was still massive, and the various statues and life-size figures of anime characters near the entrance were the same. 'No, have a few been added? I've never seen that female character before?' Anyway, the team gathered around Kang Woojin, and he started walking. A slight tension arose. 'I wonder what the Japanese voice actors will be like - it's my first time seeing them.' Soon, he would meet many voice actors participating in 'Boyfriend: Remake'. In Japan, where animation is so powerful, voice actors are treated a bit like celebrities, unlike in Korea. Popular voice actors even hold fan meetings, sign autographs, and appear on variety shows. Still, it was very unfamiliar to Kang Woojin. At this moment, -Vroom, vroom, vroom. Woojin stopped in his tracks. His phone in the pocket of his blue jacket was vibrating with a long buzz. It was a call, and Kang Woojin gestured to the staff, including Jang Su-hwan, that he would be a moment and checked the caller. 'The legend. No, it's Director Ahn Ga-bok.' The caller was Director Ahn Ga-bok. Kang Woojin then pressed the phone to his ear with a stern face. \\"Yes, Director. How are you?\\" An old voice came through the phone. \\"Yes, we're both busy, so I thought I'd just get to the point and called you.\\" \\"Please go ahead.\\" \\"The Cannes Film Festival opening date has been confirmed, September 30th. It will run for 10 days from then.\\" September 30th, the opening of the Cannes Film Festival. \\"Is that so?\\" Meaning, around that time, Kang Woojin would be going to France. < Chronicles (9) > End"},{"instruction":"< 역대 (11) > 처음 강우진이 리딩장에 있는 ‘A10 스튜디오’의 복도에 발을 들였을 때. “강우진씨 캐스팅되고 화제성은 확 높아졌는데, 뭔가- 좀 성우 업계가 쉽게 보여지는 것 같지 않아?” 성우로 보이는 인원 둘의 일본어가 바로 들려왔다. 보니 몇 걸음 앞에서 연신 강우진을 주제로 쑥떡대고 있었다. 천천히 그들을 따라가는지라 인기척을 못 느꼈는지 성우들은 수군댐을 멈추진 않았다. 그들의 대화를 가장 적나라하게 알아들은 건 당연히 강우진 본인이었다. 그런 그가 미간을 티 안 나게 좁혔다. ‘미친? 내 뒷담?’ 살짝 울컥이는 강우진. 솔직히 빡쳐도 이상하지 않은 장면이었다. 하지만 컨셉질로 인해 늘 의연해야 하는 그였기에 일단 시니컬함은 유지한다. 참는 것은 아니었다. 어디까지 씨불이나 지켜보는 것. 그러거나 말거나 일본 성우들은 우진의 얘기를 신명나게 푼다. 이쯤 우진의 옆에 선, 파란 단발에 끝부분이 검게 변한 한예정이 세상 차갑게 말했다. “오빠, 쟤네 오빠 얘기하는 거 같아요. 안 좋은 쪽으로.” 전문적이진 않지만 그녀도 일본어를 듣는 수준은 됐다. 이 소식은 스타일리스트 팀에 금세 퍼졌다. 강우진이 그녀들을 진정시켰다. “나도 알아, 일단 둬봐.” 일본 성우들은 리딩장으로 보이는 대회의실 유리문을 열었을 때 멍청한 소리를 시전했다. “내기 어때?” “무슨 내기?” “그가 첫 대사부터 저는지 아닌지로.” 강우진은 벼르고 있었다. 뭐, 컨셉질로 센척을 할 타이밍이기도 했지만, 우진의 원래 성격상으로도 이런 장면에선 노빠꾸였다. 안 건들면 모를까 대놓고 터치하면 못 참지. 따라서 우진이 목소리를 저 밑으로 깔았다. “좋습니다, 내기하시죠.” 하지만 음량은 키웠다. 낮고 무거운 그의 음성이 리딩장에 울렸다. 따라서 안에 있던 수십 스탭들, 미리 도착한 일본 성우들이 입구 쪽으로 짠 듯이 고개를 돌렸다. 그리고 강우진의 뒷담을 하던 일본 성우들은 화들짝 놀랐다. 반면, 강우진은 모두에게 들으라는 듯 차분히 말했다. “내기, 아마추어인 저와 프로인 두 분 포함, 성우분들 중 누가 더 많이 저는지로. 어떠십니까?” 일본 성우들의 눈이 훅 커졌다. 아니, 리딩장에 있는 모든 이가 그랬다. 덕분에 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 스탭들이 수군거린다. “바, 방금 강우진씨가 뭐라고 했어?” “내기하자고 했던 것 같아.” “성우분들이랑 자기랑 누가 더 잘하는지로?” “나도 그렇게 들었어.” “뭐지? 말려야 하나?” 이미 성우들 사이로 우진의 소문이 안 좋다는 걸 인지한 스탭들이었다. 대부분의 표정이 단숨에 어두워졌다. 리딩장에 있는 몇몇 성우들도 마찬가지였다. 다만, 그들은 어둡기보단 찡그림에 가깝다. 강우진의 말에 약간 기분이 나쁜 듯 보였다. 허나 우진은 아랑곳없이 앞에 선 성우들에게 눈을 떼지 않았다. “왜 말씀이 없으십니까.” 워낙에 그의 눈동자가 냉소적이라 그런지 우진의 뒷담을 하던 성우들이 바짝 얼었다. “예? 그, 그게.” “안 하실 겁니까? 내기.” 물론, 그딴 건 강우진에게 신경 쓰이지 않았다. “여기 오시면서 제 얘기를 하셨잖아요. 뭐라 그러셨죠? ‘오늘 고단하겠어, 강우진씨 아마추어라 실수 연발일 테니까.’라고 하셨나요?” “저, 저기. 그건.” “다른 말들도 하셨는데 기억이 잘 안 나네요.” “······” 우물대며 눈치를 살피는 일본 성우들. 반면, 근엄한 얼굴의 우진은 그들을 보다가 고요해진 리딩장을 쭉 훑었다. 전부가 본인을 응시하고 있다. 몇몇 스탭은 말리려는 움직임도 보였다. 다시금 앞에 선 성우들에게 시선을 붙인 강우진. 보통이라는 상황과 많은 사람들의 시선 덕에 적당히 정리하겠지만. “흠-” 우진은 ‘개썅마이웨이’답게 멈추지 않았다. “이런 게 그 텃세입니까?” “······” “안 들었으면 모를까, 직접 들으니 기분이 썩 불편한데요.” 슬슬 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 스탭이나 성우들이 분위기 파악을 했다. 아, 뒷말하다가 걸렸구나. 80% 이상이 당황하기 시작했다. 강우진처럼 이렇게 대놓고 찌르는 게 일본에서는 흔하지 않았으니까. 일본이란 나라의 특유한 분위기랄지. 그래서 뭐? 물론, 강우진에겐 하등 관계 없는 것이었다. ‘내가 그런 것까지 맞춰야 되냐? 빡치면 그때그때 풀어야지.’ 우진이 다시 차갑게 말했다. “내기, 안 하십니까?” 반대로 성우들은 거의 혼이 빠진 상태였다. 이런 경우가 없었기에 사고가 멈춘 것. “······죄송, 죄송합니다.” “어쩌다 보니 말실수를- 사과드릴게요.” 노빠꾸인 강우진의 태도에, 그의 뒤에 있던 한예정 등 인원들의 어깨가 쭉 올라갔다. 봤냐? 이게 우리 강우진이야 따위의 느낌. 와중 스탭들이 조심조심 다가와 중재를 시작했다. “저, 저기 강우진씨 일단 진정하세요. 저희도 사과드리겠습니다.” 강우진이 별수롭지 않게 답했다. “딱히 평소와 다르지 않습니다.” “네? 아- 네. 죄송해요.” 여러 스탭들과 ‘A10 스튜디오’ 기획팀 직원들이 사과를 시전했다. 물론, 우진의 앞에 선 성우들도 마찬가지. 강우진은 비록 성우 쪽으론 경험이 없으나 어쨌든 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 남주였다. 그 무게감을 무시할 수는 없다. 잠시간 사과를 받던 우진은. “······” 딱히 답하는 것 없이 그들을 응시하다가 돌연 무심한 표정으로 발을 움직였다. 그리곤 어정쩡하게 선, 리딩장에 미리 자리를 채웠던 일본 성우들에게 고개를 숙였다. “안녕하세요, 강우진입니다. 오늘 잘 부탁드립니다.” 인사할 건 또 해야지. 강우진이 나름 뒤끝 없는 성격이기도 했다. 곧, 성우들이 하나둘 엉거주춤 우진을 향해 허리를 숙였다. 묘한 분위기를 단번에 강우진이 휘어잡았다. 이어. -스윽. 우진이 ㄷ자형 책상 위에 올려진 배역표를 보며 덤덤히 움직였다. 그의 배역표는 당연하겠지만 제일 첫 자리였다. -드륵. 아무렇지 않게 앉아서 대본을 펼치는 그. 반대로 일본 성우들은 눈치를 살피기 바빴다. 말은 안 하지만 그들의 눈엔 비슷한 대사가 서렸다. ‘뭐 저런 별종이 다 있지?’ 분노하는 것처럼 보이다가 대뜸 예의 있게 인사를 하는 모습. 거기에 지금은 또 평온하게 대본을 보고 있다. 다분히 또라이처럼 보일 만했다. 그리고 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 직원 또는 스탭들은 단번에 우진의 성격을 파악했다. 그럴만한 포스였으니. “와- 강우진씨 무게감 미쳤는데요?” “그러니까. 저번 미팅 땐 그냥 좀 과묵하구나 싶었는데, 오늘 보니까 카리스마가 그냥······” “일본에선 진짜 보기 드문 캐릭터네요.” “성우님들 표정 봐, 그냥 한 번에 꺾였네.” 의외로 만족하는 건 강우진의 팀들이었다. ㄷ자형 책상을 둥그렇게 감싼 간이 의자에 엉덩이를 붙이던 그들 중, 스타일리스트 실장 한예정이 물꼬를 텄다. “어디 뒷담을. 이게 깡우진이다 이거야 이것들아.” ‘깡우진’, 우진이 모르는 새로운 별명이었다. 잠시 후. 엄숙해진 리딩장으로 인원들이 계속 추가됐다. 일본의 유명 성우들, 스탭들, ‘A10 스튜디오’의 간부나 관계자들 등등. 초반엔 20명 남짓이던 게 지금은 거의 50명이 넘어가고 있었고, 어느새 수십 자리를 거의 꽉 채운 일본 성우들 사이로 소문이 퍼진다. “진짜? 저 강우진씨가 그렇게 말했다고?” “예예, 정말이라니까요. 아마추어인 자기하고 프로 성우님들이랑 누가 더 잘하는 지로 내기하자고 하는데 포스가 줄줄 흘렀어요.” “······잘못이야 저 성우님들이 먼저 하긴 했네. 그래도 자신감이 넘치는데? 우진님, 성우 경험이 있나?” “처음이라고 들었어요 저는.” 강우진의 노빠구 선포가 가열차게 번졌다. 반응은 적당히 갈렸다. 신인류는 보듯 신기해하는 성우 반, 세상 자신감이 넘치는 우진을 묘하게 바라보는 성우 반. 이쯤. “안녕하세요오-” 웅성대는 리딩장으로 여자 성우 한 명이 입장했다. 딱 붙는 반팔티에 루즈한 청바지, 키나 얼굴이 아담한 여자였다. 눈이 상당히 크고 덧니가 눈에 띈다. 뭐랄까, 딱 일본에서 인기 있을 미모. 그녀는 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 여주 ‘엔마 쿄코’를 맡은, 일본 성우계의 아이돌로 불리는 나츠미 우미였다. 인지도, 인기로 따지면 탑급. “어어? 분위기 왜 이렇게 무거워요??” 과연 목소리 역시 좋다. 아나운서 느낌으로 명확하면서도 부드럽다. 그런 나츠미 우미는 인기가 폭발하고 있기에 콧대가 퍽 높은 상태였고, 리딩장에 입장하자마자 여러 성우들과 인사하면서도 소문을 전해 들었다. “에에에- 정말 그런 일이 있었어요?” 당연히 강우진 관련이었다. 나츠미 우미가 제일 앞자리에 앉은 우진을 힐끔했다. 앉은 우진에겐 누구도 다가가지 않았다. 뭔가 검은 에너지가 풀풀 풍기는 것 같다. ‘우와 미쳤나 봐. 약간 음침한 것 같기도 하고? 아니, 센고쿠 토오루랑 비슷한가?’ 이 자리에 오기 전부터 나츠미 우미는 강우진의 얘기를 몇 번 들었었다. 친한 배우들 사이로도 그는 핫했으니까. 어쨌든 직접 본 건 처음. ‘내 상상보다 좀 더 심한데??’ 그런 나츠미 우미가 목을 가다듬으면서도 강우진에게로 걸었다. 본인이 여주니 인사는 해야 했고 호기심이 발동했으니까. 그녀는 콧대가 높아진 탓에 자존감이 높았다. 남자와 친해지는 건 일도 아니라고 생각했다. “큼큼, 저기-” 남자들이야 다 똑같잖아? 나츠미 우미가 우진의 옆에 서서 눈웃음쳤다. “안녕하세요?” 들리는 일본어와 향기에 우진이 고개를 돌렸다. 강우진의 얼굴을 보자마자 나츠미 우미는 속으로 외쳤다. ‘와!! 냉미남!’ 반대로 우진은 나츠미 우미를 봤지만 단단한 표정엔 별 변화가 없다. “네, 안녕하십니까.” 컨셉질이 짙지만 속내도 같았다. ‘누군데? 아- 성운가? 오, 성우 중에서도 꽤 귀여운 애가 있네.’ 큰 동요가 없었다. 그에게 나츠미 우미는 그저 꽤 예쁜 성우네? 정도가 다였다. 이미 강우진의 주변엔 패왕급 미모의 여배우들이 넘쳤으니까. 이를 모르던 나츠미 우미는 우진에게 대뜸 손을 내밀었다. 보통 이러면 대부분의 남자는 실실 웃으며 그녀의 손을 잡았었다. “강우진님? 엄청 잘생기셨어요! 잘 부탁드려요, ‘엔마 쿄코’ 역 맡은 나츠미 우미라고 해요. 친해졌으면 좋겠다 우리, 그죠?” 자리서 천천히 일어난 우진은 나츠미 우미의 손을 대강 잡은 뒤 낮고 짧게 답했다. “잘 부탁합니다.” 그리곤 다시 앉았다. 과정이 5초도 안 걸렸다. 이는 나츠미 우미가 예상한 반응이 아니었다. 살짝 당황한 그녀가 속으로 외쳤고. ‘이게 이러면 안 되는데?? 약간 거, 거만하지 않아??!’ 애매하게 허공에 뜬 자신의 손을 휙 내린 그녀가 아랫입술을 잘근 씹었다. ‘칫, 왜 이렇게 쌀쌀맞아? 뭐냐고. 지금 좀 잘나간다 이건가? 됐다 이거야, 성우판에선 내가 더 잘나가니까.’ 그때였다. “우진님.” 둘 사이로 중년의 여자 목소리가 끼었다. 돌아보니 짙은 갈색 머리를 묶은 선한 인상의 여자가 다가오고 있었다. 피아노로 강우진과 엮인 유명 성우 아사미 사야였다. 대선배의 등장에 나츠미 우미가 약간 놀라며 허리를 숙였다. “허! 아, 안녕하세요 선배님!” 사야가 빙긋 웃으며 손을 흔든다. “응, 안녕하세요.” 이어 그녀는 바로 강우진에게 붙었다. “오랜만이죠? SNS 관련 일 터지고 나서 연락드릴까 엄청 고민했었어요, 제가 피해를 드렸나 싶어서.” 우진은 진작에 일어난 상태였다. “아니요, 전혀 그런 거 없었습니다.” “다행이네요. 우진님 덕에 우리 딸이 요즘 항상 웃어요. 감사합니다.” “그렇습니까?” “네. 참, 아세요? 요즘 애들 학교에서 우진님 인기가 엄청나다고 들었어요. 딸이 엄청 자랑하거든요.” “처음 듣습니다.” “더 잘되셨으면 좋겠다고 딸이 매일 노래를 불러요. 혹시 성우 관련해서 어려운 게 있으면 저한테 말해주세요.” “감사합니다.” 참으로 평온한 대화였다. 다만, 옆에서 지켜보던 나츠미 우미는 평화롭지 않았다. 우진의 목소리 톤이 자신과 판이했으니까. ‘왜 부드러워? 온도차 뭐냐고. 서, 설마 연상이 취향인가??!’ 그 순간. “자자, 다들 앉아 봅시다.” ‘A10 스튜디오’ 간부들 포함 동그란 안경을 낀, ㄷ자형 책상 상석에 선 남자가 리딩장을 정리했다. ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 총괄 감독이었다. “안녕하십니까, ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 감독을 맡은 사쿠이치 마히로입니다.” 애니메이션 업계에선 유명 감독. 덕분에 우진과 아사미 사야, 나츠미 우미 등 전체 성우들이 제자리에 엉덩이를 붙였다. 감독은 성우들의 소개를 이었다. 남주 강우진, 여주 나츠미 우미, 아사미 사야 등 수십 성우들의 소개를 마친 감독이 제작진과 ‘A10 스튜디오’의 간부들까지 알렸다. 이윽고. “그럼, 목 푸는 느낌으로 1화 리딩 가볍게 시작하겠습니다.” 상석의 감독이 앉고 정면 대형 모니터에 애니메이션이 틀어졌다. 완성본이 아니라서 오프닝이나 OST 또는 타이틀은 없다. 바로 내용부터 나왔다. 여주 나츠미 우미 포함 수십 성우들은 시선을 모니터에 붙이면서도, 덤덤한 얼굴인 강우진을 힐끔했다. ‘실수···하겠지?’ ‘내기를 그렇게 선포했을 정도면- 어지간히 연습했겠지만, 처음 대사 들어가는 건 맘추기 힘들어.’ ‘근데 떨리는 것도 없나? 왜 저리 평화로워?’ 은근 강우진이 실수하길 바라는 분위기. 유일하게 아사미 사야만 걱정의 마음이었다. ‘너무 부담가지지 않았으면 좋겠는데.’ 이때 초대형 모니터 속 ‘남사친: 리메이크’에서, 애매한 크기의 안경에 더벅머리 남자 캐릭터가 나왔다. 침대에서 부스스 일어나는 그. 남주 캐릭터 센고쿠 토오루였다. 즉, 그의 첫 대사가 나오기 직전. 강우진은 덤덤하게 모니터를 보다가 딱히 고민하는 것 없이 입을 열었다. “하······귀찮아. 역시 고요함이 최고야. 아니 내방이 최고.” 중구난방인 캐릭터의 입과 우진의 목소리는 조금의 오차도 없이 완벽했다. 당연했다. 강우진은 저 초대형 모니터 속의 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 세상을 직접 살았으며, 지금 각인된 ‘센고쿠 토오루’를 끌어올린 상태니까. 이어진 대사 역시 같았다. 캐릭터 입 모양의 리듬, 쉼, 감정과 상황에 따른 강세 등 어처구니없을 정도로 스무스했다. 심지어 그는 표정 하나 변하지 않았다. 상석에 앉은 감독이 우진을 보며 놀랄 정도. ‘첫 대사부터 저렇게 깔끔하게 들어가는 건- 나도 처음 봤는데. 근데 성우가 처음이라고??’ 곧, 수십 성우들의 시선 전부가 강우진에게 박혔다. 황당을 넘어 환장의 느낌이 담겼다. 특히. ‘······어? 어어어어??!’ 여주 나츠미 우미는 저도 모르게 한 손으로 입을 막았다. ‘거짓말! 더럽게 잘하잖아 저, 저 냉미남!!’ < 역대 (11) > 끝","output":"< Chronicles (11) > When Kang Woojin first stepped into the corridor of 'A10 Studio' where the reading was taking place. \\"Kang Woojin's casting has definitely increased the buzz, but doesn't it make the voice acting industry seem a bit too accessible?\\" He immediately heard a conversation in Japanese between two people who appeared to be voice actors. They were gossiping about Kang Woojin just a few steps ahead. Unaware of Woojin's presence, they didn't stop their murmuring. Naturally, Woojin himself understood their conversation most vividly. He slightly furrowed his brow without showing it. 'Crazy? Are they talking behind my back?' Woojin felt a surge of irritation. It was a scene that would understandably make anyone angry. However, due to his commitment to maintaining his concept, he kept his cynicism. It wasn't about enduring; it was about observing how far they would go. Regardless, the Japanese voice actors were gleefully gossiping about Woojin. At this point, Han Ye-jeong, with her blue bob hair that darkened at the ends, spoke coldly beside him. \\"Oppa, they seem to be talking about you. In a not-so-nice way.\\" She wasn't a professional, but she understood Japanese well enough. The news quickly spread among the stylist team. Kang Woojin calmed them down. \\"I know, just let it be for now.\\" The Japanese voice actors were making a foolish bet as they opened the door to the conference room that seemed to be the reading room. \\"How about a bet?\\" \\"What bet?\\" \\"Whether he messes up his first line or not.\\" Woojin was ready. It was time to act tough according to his concept, but even by his own nature, he was relentless in such situations. If left alone, he might not react, but if openly provoked, he couldn't hold back. So Woojin spoke up with his voice lowered. \\"Sure, let's bet.\\" But he raised his volume. His low and heavy voice echoed in the reading room. As a result, the dozens of staff members and Japanese voice actors already inside turned their heads towards the entrance. The Japanese voice actors who had been badmouthing Woojin were startled. On the other hand, Woojin calmly addressed everyone as if to make sure they heard. \\"Let's bet, amateurs like me and the professional voice actors here, to see who messes up more. How about it?\\" The eyes of the Japanese voice actors widened. In fact, everyone in the reading room did. The staff of 'Boyfriend: Remake' began to murmur. \\"Did Kang Woojin just say something?\\" \\"It sounded like he suggested a bet.\\" \\"Between the voice actors and himself to see who performs better?\\" \\"That's what I heard too.\\" \\"Should we stop this?\\" The staff, who had become aware of the negative rumors about Woojin among the voice actors, had their expressions darken instantly. Some of the voice actors in the reading room felt the same, though their expressions were closer to frowning. They seemed slightly offended by Woojin's words. However, Woojin didn't care and kept his eyes on the voice actors in front of him. \\"Why aren't you saying anything?\\" Perhaps because his gaze was so cynical, the voice actors who had been talking behind his back froze. \\"Eh? That, that is...\\" \\"Are you not going to take the bet?\\" Of course, Woojin wasn't really bothered by such things. \\"You were talking about me on your way here, weren't you? What did you say? 'It's going to be tough for Kang Woojin today, he's an amateur so he'll make a lot of mistakes.' Was that it?\\" \\"Uh, that's...\\" \\"I can't quite remember the other things you said.\\" The Japanese voice actors hesitated and looked around nervously. Meanwhile, the stern-faced Woojin glanced over the now-silent reading room. Everyone was staring at him. Some staff members even seemed to be trying to intervene. Kang Woojin, who had turned his gaze back to the voice actors in front of him, would normally settle things amicably given the situation and the many eyes on him. \\"Hmm-\\" But Woojin, true to his 'my way or the highway' attitude, didn't stop. \\"Is this what you call seniority?\\" \\"......\\" \\"It's one thing not to hear it, but quite another to hear it directly. I find it quite unpleasant.\\" The staff and voice actors of 'Boyfriend: Remake' began to grasp the situation. Ah, they got caught talking behind his back. Over 80% started to panic. It was uncommon in Japan to confront someone so directly, given the country's unique atmosphere. So what? Of course, Kang Woojin didn't care about that. 'Do I have to adjust to that too? If I'm angry, I should vent it right away.' Woojin spoke again coldly. \\"Are you not going to bet?\\" On the contrary, the voice actors were almost soulless. They had never encountered such a situation before and were at a loss. \\"......I'm sorry, I apologize.\\" \\"We misspoke, we apologize.\\" With Woojin's relentless attitude, the shoulders of Han Ye-jeong and others behind him rose. See? This is our Kang Woojin. Meanwhile, staff members cautiously approached to mediate. \\"Uh, Mr. Kang Woojin, please calm down for now. We apologize as well.\\" Woojin replied nonchalantly. \\"I'm not any different than usual.\\" \\"Really? Ah- yes. I'm sorry.\\" Several staff members and 'A10 Studio' planning team employees offered apologies. Of course, the voice actors in front of Woojin did the same. Although Woojin had no experience in voice acting, he was still the male lead of 'Boyfriend: Remake'. His significance couldn't be ignored. After receiving apologies for a while, Woojin... \\"......\\" Without giving any particular response, he simply looked at them and then suddenly moved on with an indifferent expression. He then bowed to the Japanese voice actors who had awkwardly taken their seats in the reading room. \\"Hello, I'm Kang Woojin. Please take care of me today.\\" He had to greet them, after all. Woojin was also someone without much of a grudge. Soon, the voice actors one by one awkwardly bowed back to Woojin. He had quickly taken control of the strange atmosphere. Then, -Swish. Woojin casually looked at the role chart on the U-shaped desk and moved nonchalantly. His role chart was, of course, in the very first spot. -Click. He sat down as if nothing was amiss and opened the script. In contrast, the Japanese voice actors were busy glancing around. They didn't say it, but their eyes conveyed a similar sentiment. 'What kind of oddity is he?' He seemed angry but then suddenly greeted politely, and now he was peacefully looking at the script. It was enough to make him seem a bit crazy. The employees and staff of 'Boyfriend: Remake' quickly grasped Woojin's character. He had that kind of presence. \\"Wow- Kang Woojin's presence is insane, isn't it?\\" \\"Exactly. I thought he was just a bit taciturn at the last meeting, but today I see he has charisma that's just......\\" \\"It's really rare to see such a character in Japan.\\" \\"Look at the expressions of the voice actors, they just got knocked down in one go.\\" Surprisingly, it was Woojin's team that was satisfied. Among them, stylist director Han Ye-jeong, who had taken a seat on the makeshift chairs surrounding the U-shaped desk, started the conversation. \\"Talking behind his back. This is Kang Woojin, you guys.\\" 'Kang Woojin', a new nickname Woojin was unaware of. Shortly after, The solemn reading room continued to fill with people. Famous Japanese voice actors, staff, executives, and officials of 'A10 Studio', etc. What started with about 20 people had now grown to over 50, and rumors spread among the Japanese voice actors who had nearly filled the dozens of seats. \\"Really? Did Kang Woojin really say that?\\" \\"Yes, yes, it's true. He proposed a bet with the professional voice actors about who's better, and he was just oozing confidence.\\" \\"......It's the voice actors' fault for starting it, but he's so confident. Does Mr. Woojin have experience in voice acting?\\" \\"I heard it's his first time.\\" Kang Woojin's declaration of no backing down spread like wildfire. The reactions were mixed. Half of the voice actors were intrigued as if seeing a new species, while the other half looked at the overly confident Woojin strangely. At this point, \\"Hellooo-\\" Into the buzzing reading room, a female voice actor entered. She wore a tight short-sleeved tee and loose jeans, and she was petite in stature and face. Her eyes were quite large, and her snaggletooth was noticeable. In short, she had the kind of beauty that would be popular in Japan. She was Natsumi Umi, the idol of the Japanese voice acting world, who was cast as the female lead 'Enma Kyoko' in 'Boyfriend: Remake'. Top-tier in terms of recognition and popularity. \\"Uh? Why is the atmosphere so heavy??\\" Indeed, her voice was pleasant. Clear yet soft, like an announcer. Natsumi Umi, who was exploding in popularity and thus quite proud, entered the reading room and greeted several voice actors while also hearing the rumors. \\"Eeeh- Did that really happen?\\" Naturally, it was about Kang Woojin. Natsumi Umi glanced at Woojin, who was sitting in the front row. No one approached him. It seemed as if he was emitting some sort of dark energy. 'Wow, he must be crazy. He seems a bit gloomy? Or is he like Sengoku Tooru?' Before coming here, Natsumi Umi had heard about Kang Woojin a few times. He was hot among her actor friends. Anyway, this was her first time seeing him in person. 'He's a bit more intense than I imagined??' Clearing her throat, Natsumi Umi walked towards Woojin. She had to greet him since she was the female lead, and her curiosity was piqued. Her pride was high due to her raised nose. She thought befriending men was no big deal. \\"Ahem, excuse me-\\" Men are all the same, right? Natsumi Umi stood beside Woojin and smiled with her eyes. \\"Hello?\\" Woojin turned his head at the sound of Japanese and the scent. As soon as Natsumi Umi saw Kang Woojin's face, she exclaimed internally. 'Wow!! A cold beauty!' Conversely, Woojin saw Natsumi Umi but showed no change in his stern expression. \\"Yes, hello.\\" His concept was strong, but his inner thoughts were similar. 'Who is this? Ah- a voice actor? Oh, there's quite a cute one among the voice actors.' He wasn't particularly shaken. To him, Natsumi Umi was just a pretty voice actor. Kang Woojin was already surrounded by actresses of imperial beauty. Unaware of this, Natsumi Umi extended her hand to Woojin. Usually, most men would smile and take her hand. \\"Mr. Kang Woojin? You're very handsome! Please take care of me, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, playing the role of 'Enma Kyoko'. I hope we can become friends, right?\\" Woojin, who had slowly stood up, casually took Natsumi Umi's hand and replied briefly and lowly. \\"Please take care of me.\\" Then he sat back down. The process took less than 5 seconds. This was not the response Natsumi Umi had expected. Slightly flustered, she thought to herself. 'This isn't how it's supposed to go?? Is he, like, arrogant??!' She quickly withdrew her hand that was awkwardly hanging in the air and bit her lower lip. 'Tch, why is he so cold? What's this about? Is he feeling a bit too successful now? Fine, I'm more popular in the voice acting world anyway.' That's when, \\"Mr. Woojin.\\" A middle-aged woman's voice intervened between them. Turning around, a kind-looking woman with tied-up dark brown hair was approaching. It was Asami Saya, a famous voice actor linked to Kang Woojin through piano. Natsumi Umi was slightly surprised and bowed. \\"Ah! Hello, senior!\\" Saya smiled and waved her hand. \\"Yes, hello.\\" Then she immediately joined Kang Woojin. \\"It's been a while, hasn't it? I was really worried about contacting you after the whole SNS incident, wondering if I had caused you any trouble.\\" Woojin had already stood up. \\"No, not at all.\\" \\"That's a relief. Thanks to you, my daughter is always smiling these days. Thank you.\\" \\"Is that so?\\" \\"Yes. By the way, did you know? I heard that you're incredibly popular at my daughter's school. She brags about it all the time.\\" \\"I hadn't heard.\\" \\"She sings every day, hoping you'll do even better. If you have any difficulties related to voice acting, please let me know.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" It was a truly peaceful conversation. However, Natsumi Umi, who was watching from the side, was not at peace. Woojin's tone of voice was completely different from when he spoke to her. 'Why is he so gentle? What's with the temperature difference? Is he into older women??!' At that moment, \\"Everyone, please take a seat.\\" A man with round glasses, standing at the head of the U-shaped desk, organized the reading room. He was the overall director of 'Boyfriend: Remake'. \\"Hello, I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, the director of 'Boyfriend: Remake'.\\" A famous director in the animation industry. As a result, Woojin, Asami Saya, Natsumi Umi, and all the voice actors took their seats. The director continued with the introductions of the voice actors. After introducing the male lead Kang Woojin, the female lead Natsumi Umi, Asami Saya, and dozens of other voice actors, he also informed everyone about the production team and executives of 'A10 Studio'. Then, \\"Let's start with a light reading of episode 1 to warm up.\\" The director sat down, and the animation was played on the large monitor in front of them. Since it wasn't the final version, there was no opening, OST, or title. It started with the content right away. Natsumi Umi and dozens of other voice actors focused on the monitor, but they also glanced at the calm Kang Woojin. 'He'll make a mistake... right?' 'He declared the bet so confidently - he must have practiced a lot, but it's hard to get the first line right.' 'But isn't he nervous? Why is he so peaceful?' There was an underlying hope that Woojin would make a mistake. Only Asami Saya was genuinely concerned. 'I hope he's not putting too much pressure on himself.' At that moment, in the 'Boyfriend: Remake' on the large monitor, a male character with ambiguous-sized glasses and bushy hair appeared. He was getting up from the bed, groggy. It was the male lead character, Sengoku Tooru. In other words, it was just before his first line. Woojin, who had been calmly watching the monitor, opened his mouth without much thought. \\"Ha...... Annoying. Silence is the best. No, my room is the best.\\" The character's mouth movements and Woojin's voice matched perfectly without any discrepancy. It was natural. Kang Woojin had lived in the world of 'Boyfriend: Remake' on that large monitor, and he was now channeling the character 'Sengoku Tooru'. The following lines were the same. The rhythm of the character's mouth movements, the pauses, the emphasis according to the emotions and situation were absurdly smooth. Even the director seated at the head was surprised by how flawlessly Woojin entered with his first line. 'I've never seen anyone enter their first line so cleanly - and he's a first-time voice actor??' Soon, all the eyes of the dozens of voice actors were fixed on Kang Woojin. Their expressions were beyond astonishment. Especially, '......Eh? Ehhhhhh??!' The female lead Natsumi Umi involuntarily covered her mouth with one hand. 'No way! He's so damn good, that cold handsome guy!!' < Chronicles (11) > End"},{"instruction":"< 역대 (15) > 길다면 길었던 ‘낯기생’과 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 스케줄을 마친 강우진. 그가 일본에서 한국으로 넘어온 시각은 오늘인 4일의 이른 아침이었다. 그럼에도 공항에는 수십 기자들과 수백의 팬들이 몰렸었다. 『[스타포토]일본 스케줄 마치고 공항에 나타난 강우진/ 사진』 『강우진, 몰린 취재진과 수백 팬들에게 여유롭게 손 흔들며/사진』 생각보다 많은 인파가 몰렸기에, 당초 간단한 인터뷰를 하려던 강우진도 급하게 공항을 빠져나가야 했다. 덕분에 금의환향한, 혈혈단신으로 일본은 뒤집어 놨던 강우진의 복귀컷은 간단히 손을 흔드는 게 다였다. 하지만 그의 한국 복귀 기사는 끝없이 파생됐다. 사실, 어제부터 적잖게 떡밥이 던져지고는 있었지만 실제 우진이 한국에 도착하자 더 극심해졌다. 더불어 언론 또는 여론은 그와 관련된 숱한 이슈, 작품들을 다시금 폭발적으로 언급하기 시작했다. 『‘강우진 복귀’, 1300만 코 앞인 ‘실종의 섬’에 부스터 달아 줄까』 『[기획]‘낯기생’ 촬영 끝낸 ‘강우진’, 이젠 ‘거머리’와 ‘이로운 악’ 차례?』 과연 이슈의 왕 다운 화려한 환향이었다. 다룰 재료는 넘쳤다. -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아니 아침부터 강우진 기사 ㅈㄴ많길래 뭔가 했더니 컴백했넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -그럴만함 혼자서 국위선양하며 쌉캐리중이니까 -↑ㅇㅈㅈ본인 일본 사는데 강우진 일본 여자들한테 인기 지림....이상형 물어보면 죄다 냉미남이래 ㅅㅂ...... 한국뿐 아니라 일본 쪽의 건까지. -근데 강우진은 성우하는 거 더빙은 마친 거임?

넌 우진씨 처음 보나?” “네! 오신다는 말만 들었지 처음 뵀어요!” “실물이 훨 낫지?” “완전요, 100배 정도.” 샵의 디자이너부터 직원들까지 강우진을 구경하기 바빴다. 자주 오는 곳이지만 그간 우진의 위세가 퍽 오른 탓이었다. 뭐가 됐든 간만에 샵의 자리에 앉은 우진이 정면 거울은 본다. -스윽. 차분한 흑발에 간편한 반팔과 청바지. 물론, 얼굴엔 시니컬함이 짙지만 그의 속은 꽤 달아오른 상태였다. ‘크- 역시 한국이 좋네. 속이 편해, 속이.’ 고향에 돌아와서였다. 부적 비행기 탈 일이 많아진, 여기저기서 해외파라는 착각이 붙은 그였어도 알맹이는 여전히 토종 한국인이었으니까. 이때. -스윽. 우진의 뒤로 덩치 좋은 장수환이 들어섰다. “형님.” 최근 로드에서 스케줄 매니저로 승급한 그였다. 물론, 전반적인 핸들링은 최성건이 하지만 때때로 장수환이 진행하기도 했다. 그런 그가 몸집과 비교하면 좁쌀만 한 다이어리를 펼친 채 우진에게 브리핑했다. “근데 정말 괜찮으십니까? 하루 정돈 쉬셔도-” 우진이 무심히 낮은 톤으로 답했다. “별문제 없어. 괜찮으니까 말해.” “후, 대단하십니다, 진짜. 그럼 바로 말씀드릴게요. 오늘도 심히 빡빡합니다. 일단 시작은 인터뷰 두 건이 있구요, 그런 다음에······” 장수환이 오늘과 내일의 스케줄을 읊는다. 그런데 끝이 없다. 순간, 강우진은 실수했나? 싶은 생각이 들기도 했다. 예정된 인터뷰 뒤로 강우진의 SNS용 포함 화보, ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널의 복귀 인사 같은 소통 관련 간단한 촬영과 미팅, 오후엔 ‘실종의 섬’ 팀과 조우해 미뤘던 후반 홍보용 영상 촬영까지. ‘어우- 미친. 밤 11시 이후 퇴근 확정이네.’ 그래도 새벽에 안 끝나는 게 어딘가? 우진은 긍정적으로 생각하기로 했다. ‘어차피 해야 될 것들 미루면 뭐하냐~ 걍 닥치고 하는 거지.’ 이어 장수환이 다이어리 한 장을 넘기며 내일 스케줄을 읊었다. “내일은- 오전에 ‘김자반 막국수’ 관련해서 농신이랑 2차 광고 미팅, 정오쯤에 ‘거머리’ 촬영 복귀하실 겁니다.” 내일은 영화 ‘거머리’ 촬영의 복귀가 핵심이었다. ‘촬영이 얼추- 70%쯤 됐다고 했나?’ 곧, 다이어리를 덮은 장수환이 비죽 웃었다. “그리고 형님, 스케줄 전에 식사하고 움직일까 하는데 뭐 드시고 싶으십니까?” 강우진이 묵직한 얼굴로 답했다. 진한 진심이 섞인 대답이었다. “해물 라면에 참치 김밥.” 이후 샵에서 나온 강우진은 식사 뒤 바로 스케줄에 투입됐다. ‘실종의 섬’ 홍보 성격이 포함된 언론사들의 인터뷰부터 각종 촬영들까지. 시간이 어찌 갔는지 모를 만큼 신속하게 녹았다. 따라서 눈 깜짝하니 우진은 집에 도착해 있었다. 시간은 자정이 넘은 상태. “와- 씨, 진심 얼마 만에 집이냐 이거.” 아공간을 적극 활용한 탓에 남들에겐 철인으로 비췄지만, 그래도 피곤한 건 피곤한 거였다. 강우진은 신속한 샤워를 마치고 바로 침대에 몸을 던졌고. -♬♪ 다음 날, 우진의 핸드폰이 알람을 울린 시각은 아침 7시. 그러나 부스스 눈을 뜬 강우진에겐 7분 같았다. “으어어어어-” 컨셉질이 소멸한 채 고통을 호소하는 그. 자연스레 강우진은 아공간에 진입했다. 그리고 철퍽 누웠다. “하, 진심 아공간이 개꿀이긴 해. 사랑한다.” 아공간에선 시간 따위 무의미했기에, 아무 생각 없이 빈둥대던 우진은 가까스로 현실로 돌아갔다. 이윽고 강우진은. “감독님! 강우진씨 도착하셨습니다!!” 전주의 종합세트 부지에 도달했다. 아니, 정확하게는 ‘거머리’의 대형 세트장이었다. 금세 백여 명 스탭들이 우진을 반겼고, 그새 더 늙은 안가복 감독이 강우진에게 주름진 미소를 보였다. “왔구만, 고생 많았을 텐데 또 고생을 시켜야 되겠어.” “문제없습니다.” 강우진이 ‘거머리’ 후반부 촬영에 복귀했다. 한편. 강우진의 금의환향으로 ‘실종의 섬’이 다시금 급물살을 탔지만, ‘실종의 섬’ 관련 인물들은 만족할 생각이 없는지 활동 속도를 높였다. 우진이 ‘거머리’ 촬영에 복귀했을 쯤, 류정민 외의 배우들이나 권기택 감독은 더 없이 홍보에 장작을 추가했다. 각양각색의 프로에서 모습을 드러냈다는 뜻. 예를 들면 류정민. ‘실종의 섬’의 주연 중 한 명인 그는, 각종 영화를 소개하고 탐구하는 예능에 출연해. “크- 그래, 저 장면 압권이었지.” “영화를 이미 봤어도 소름이 돋네요.” “근데 정민씨는 ‘실종의 섬’의 촬영에서 가장 힘든 게 뭐였어요?” “힘든 거요? 글쎄요? 대체로 재밌었는데 아무래도 해외로케 촬영이 좀 괴롭긴 했어요.” “아아, 이번에 베트남에서 촬영했나요?” “다낭이요. 진짜 덥고 습하고 벌레 많고.” “어우, 듣기만 해도······난 벌레는 진짜 못 참아. 그럼 가장 기억에 남는 건? 똑같이 다낭?” “아니요. 솔직히 저는 강우진씨 연기가 가장 기억나요. 아무래도 스크린으로 보는 거랑 현실로 보는 게 느낌이 좀 달라서.” 추억과 함께 신명나게 영화 홍보를 잇고 있었다. “아우, 그래 맞아! 우리 복귀하신 우진씨 얘기도 좀 할까요? 연기 죽여줬죠. 진심 이중인격자 표현이 기가 막혔지.” “저는 영화보다가 소름이었던 게, 그- ‘실종의 섬’에서 우진씨 연기를 보면 두 가지 성향이 나오잖아요? 근데 점차 뒤로 갈수록 캘러스가 보이는 걸 보고 엄청 연기 잘하는구나 싶었어요.” “캘러스가 뭐예요?” “사이코패스 진단기준 중에 하난데. 냉담하고 무심한 반응이요, 자신의 분노나 잔혹함을 과장하지 않고 절제하는 것. 사람을 보고는 있지만 눈에 관심이 없어요, 사람으로 인식하지 않거나 신경을 안 쓰는 거죠.” “오- 듣고 보니까 확실히.” “공부를 하신 건지는 모르겠는데, 영화 보는 내내 우진씨는 그냥 진짜 그런 사람처럼 보였어요.” 하유라, 김이원 등의 다른 주연 배우들도 같았다. 너튜브나 각종 프로에 나와 중반부 홍보에 힘을 쏟았다. 물론, 권기택 감독도 쉬진 않았다. 그 덕에 가파른 입소문은 물론이며 ‘실종의 섬’을 여러 번 보는 관객도 생겨났다. 따라서 여러 새로운 경쟁작 영화들이 출항을 알렸으나. 『강우진 복귀 효과? ‘실종의 섬’ 이번 주 역시 ‘예매율 1위’ 굳건하게 수성』 ‘실종의 섬’의 굳건한 ‘예매율 1위’는 요지부동이었다. 6일, 이른 아침. bw 엔터. 시간은 8시쯤. 아직 출근 시간은 아니었지만 bw 엔터의 대회의실엔 꽤 붐비고 있었다. 각 팀의 팀장들과 몇몇 직원들이 회의 세팅에 여념이 없었으니까. 얼추 십수 명. “혹시 배우님들 정해진 자리가 있습니까??” “어? 없어, 없어. 그냥 지그재그로만 앉히면 돼.” “넵!” 책상에 올려지는 다과와 생수통들, 자리마다 세팅되는 투명파일들, 테스트해보는 PPT. 오늘 이 회의엔 대표인 최성건은 물론이며 bw 엔터의 간판 배우들이 모두 모일 예정이었다. 강우진은 당연하며 홍혜연이나 류정민 등등. 올해 하반기를 겨냥한 간단한 미팅이었다. 서로 공유할 것은 하고 되짚어보자는 성격이 짙었다. 이때. -스윽. 더워진 날씨에 복장이 간편해진, 오늘따라 더 냉소적인 표정이 돋보이는 강우진이 회의실에 모습을 드러냈다. 그의 등장에 각 팀의 팀장들의 얼굴에 웃음이 번졌다. “어이구- 우진씨, 일찍 오셨네요!” “이쪽에 앉으시면 됩니다!” “하하하, 오늘 안건 중에 우진씨 거가 제일 많은 건 알고 계시죠??” 그들에게 적당히 인사를 마친 우진이 상석의 바로 옆자리에 앉았다. 그리곤 딴딴한 얼굴로 앞쪽을 힐끔했다. ‘과자네, 살짝 맛만 볼까?’ 강우진이 소리를 죽여 손을 움직이려는 찰나. “안녕하세요-” 회의실 전체로 여자 목소리가 울렸다. 입구 쪽을 보니 긴 생머리 위로 흰 모자를 푹 눌러쓴, 딱 붙는 베이지 반팔의 홍혜연이 팀장들에게 손을 흔들고 있었다. 왜인지 한 쪽 옆구리엔 종이뭉치가 보였다. 그런 홍혜연이 팀장들과 인사하다 눈길을 앞쪽에 던졌다. 덤덤히 자신을 보는 강우진이 보인다. ‘빨리도 왔네, 살이 좀- 빠졌나?’ 속으로 읊조리던 홍혜연이 강우진에게 다가가서는 바로 오른쪽 자리의 의자를 빼낸다. 그러면서도 강우진에게 약간 퉁명스레 말했다. “살아 있으셨네요? 하도 연락이 없어서 생명이 위독한가 싶었어요.” 뭔가 좋은 향이 났지만 애써 참은 강우진은 낮고 진지하게 답했다. “아직은 쌩쌩합니다.” “며칠 전에 한국 온 것도 기사 보고 알았어요. 핸드폰은 가지고 다니는 거죠?” “네, 여기.” “······아니. 보여달라는 게 아니라- 하 됐어요. 그보다 살이 좀 빠진 것 같은데?” “네. 살짝이지만.” “가뜩이나 스케줄 지옥이면서 그러다 쓰러지면 올스톱인 건 알죠? 우진씨 방전 안 되는 건 아는데 그래도 잘 챙겨 먹어요, 좀.” 돌연 우진에게 잔소리하던 홍혜연이 흰 모자를 벗었다. 그 덕에 긴 생머리에서 사락 소리가 났고, 홍혜연이 챙겨온 종이뭉치를 내려보다가 헛기침을 했다. “큼! 그- 있잖아요, 혹시 이 시나리오 좀 살짝 봐줄 수 있어요? 나는 마음에 드는데 우진씨는 어떤가 해서요. 예전엔······제목만 보고도 뭔가 느끼기도 하는 거 같았어서.” 홍혜연 역시 ‘강토템’의 신자 중 하나였다. 이어 강우진이 덤덤히 말했다. “차기작입니까?” “확정은 아니구요, 들어온 것들 보는 중인데. 다음 건 드라마 말고 영화를 하고 싶어서요. 조금 마음을 가볍게 가질 수 있는 쪽으로. 아- 근데 번거로우면 내가 알아서.” “주세요.” 시니컬하게 종이뭉치를 채가는 강우진. 다만, 속으로는 비죽 웃고 있었다. ‘홍혜연님 부탁이면 뭐 쌉가능이지.’ 이내 강우진은 시나리오를 펼치는 척하며 남몰래 검지를 들었다. 당연히 시나리오에 붙은 검은 사각형을 찌른 것. 삽시간에 아공간에 진입한 그. 동시에 컨셉질을 풀었다. “온 김에 나도 좀 쉬고 좋네.” 뭐 시나리오를 줄줄이 읽는 거면 조금 번거로울 순 있으나, 아공간의 등급을 보고 대충 척만 하면 되는 거라 딱히 어려울 것도 없었다. 어차피 강토템이고 미친 감이고 뭐고 죄다 착각이라 둘러대는 것도 편하다. “보자보자-” 나열된 흰 사각형 앞으로 움직인 우진이 방금 리스트업된 시나리오를 확인했다. -[11/시나리오(제목: 프랑스를 들렀다.), B+급] -[*완성도가 매우 높은 영화 시나리오입니다. 100% 리딩이 가능합니다.] 제목만 봐선 내용이 뭔지 파악이 힘들었다. 로코? 뭐가 됐든 우진이 확인한 건 등급. ‘B+급? 아 좀 아쉬운데.’ 아니, 이 정도면 괜찮은 건가? 요즘 워낙 S급 이상 등급들만 봐온 터라 강우진의 감각이 좀 무뎠다.

Despite the early hour, dozens of reporters and hundreds of fans had gathered at the airport. 『[Star Photo] Kang Woojin appears at the airport after finishing his schedule in Japan / Photo』 『Kang Woojin, surrounded by the press and hundreds of fans, waves leisurely / Photo』 Due to the unexpectedly large crowd, Kang Woojin, who had planned to give a brief interview, had to quickly leave the airport. As a result, his return to Korea, after turning Japan upside down, was marked only by a simple wave of his hand. However, articles about his return to Korea continued to proliferate endlessly. In fact, since yesterday, there had been quite a few teasers thrown around, but as soon as Woojin actually arrived in Korea, the situation intensified. Additionally, the media and public opinion began to explosively mention the numerous issues and works related to him again. 『'Kang Woojin's Return', Will 'The Island of the Missing', Approaching 13 Million, Get a Boost?』 『[Feature] 'Kang Woojin', having finished filming 'The Stranger', is it now time for 'Leech' and 'Beneficial Evil'?』 Indeed, it was a glamorous homecoming befitting the king of issues. There was an abundance of material to cover. -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I saw so many articles about Kang Woojin from the morning and wondered what was up, turns out he's backㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -It makes sense since he's been carrying the nation's pride all by himself -↑ㅇㅈㅈ I live in Japan and Kang Woojin is insanely popular with Japanese girls... when they ask about their ideal type, they all say a cold beauty ㅅㅂ...... Not only in Korea but also related to Japan. -But has Kang Woojin finished dubbing for voice acting? -ㅇㅇㅇ It's done, the female lead is Natsumi Umi... so jealous... -Why are you mentioning some unknown like that?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Just skim through 'The Stranger' and you'll see a bunch of top Japanese actressesㅋㅋㅋㅋ -Go check Kang Woojin's Instagramㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He had a fan signing before returning to Korea ㅅㅂ and it was completely packed with thousands of seats Even when Woojin was not in Korea, he was consistently covered, but as soon as he returned, everything connected and multiplied several times over. As an actor with top-tier impact that drove clicks and media sales, new videos related to Woojin proliferated exponentially on various media including radio and video platforms like YouTube. 'BOX Movies', the film company behind 'Sea Battle', was also being detailed about the rapidly changing domestic situation. The briefing was given by a team leader, and the listeners included directors and executives. 『[Issue Pick] 'The Island of the Missing' challenges the all-time number one as Kang Woojin returns, already filling various communities with his name / Photo』 The expressions of the hopeful executives gradually darkened. However, the team leader giving the briefing did not stop. \\"As you can see, the media and public opinion are buzzing as soon as Kang Woojin returns, and 'The Island of the Missing' is being mentioned more frequently than before.\\" \\"......Hmm.\\" \\"As you know, Kang Woojin went to Japan before 'The Island of the Missing' was released, and he has not participated in any official promotional schedules since then. But just his return alone... has created this kind of flow.\\" The team leader then let out a small sigh and concluded with a sense of resignation. \\"......It would be wise to prepare ourselves mentally.\\" At the same time, in Cheongdam-dong. Kang Woojin, who had returned to Korea, had arrived at the shop. In fact, Choi Sunggun had told him to take the day off, but Woojin shook his head. 'I'm feeling pretty lively anyway.' It was a response tinged with bravado, but it was also Woojin's true feeling. Taking a day off might be nice, but he judged that piling up work and having it all come crashing down later would be more stressful. By the way, Choi Sunggun had parted ways with Woojin along the way. No, he had to be away from Kang Woojin for at least a few days. Choi Sunggun had to attend to the rising business of BW Entertainment, and a few new matters had recently been added. For example, the overseas branches of BW Entertainment in Japan and Hollywood. Anyway, the shop was in an uproar with Woojin's arrival. \\"Wow- Kang Woojin!\\" \\"Huh? Is this your first time seeing Woojin?\\" \\"Yes! I only heard he was coming, but this is my first time seeing him!\\" \\"Isn't he much better in person?\\" \\"Definitely, like 100 times better.\\" From the shop's designers to the staff, everyone was busy gawking at Kang Woojin. He was a regular visitor, but his stature had risen significantly in the meantime. Regardless, Woojin, who had taken a seat in the shop for the first time in a while, looked at himself in the mirror. -Swish. With his calm black hair, simple short sleeves, and jeans, his face was cynical, but inside he was quite heated. 'Ah- Korea is really the best. It's so comfortable, so comfortable.' It was because he had returned to his homeland. Even though he had been mistaken for an overseas star due to frequent flights, at his core, he was still a native Korean. At that moment, -Swish. The bulky Jang Su-hwan approached Woojin from behind. \\"Hyungnim.\\" Recently promoted to schedule manager on the road, Jang Su-hwan was. Of course, Choi Sunggun handled the overall management, but sometimes Jang Su-hwan took charge. He opened a diary that seemed tiny compared to his size and briefed Woojin. \\"But are you really okay? You could take at least one day off-\\" Woojin replied indifferently in a low tone. \\"There's no problem. I'm fine, so go ahead.\\" \\"Wow, you're amazing, really. Then I'll get right to it. Today is extremely tight. First, there are two interviews, and then......\\" Jang Su-hwan recited today's and tomorrow's schedules. But there seemed to be no end. For a moment, Kang Woojin wondered if he had made a mistake. After the scheduled interviews, there were various shoots including for Woojin's SNS, a return greeting for the 'Kang Woojin Side Character' channel, simple communication-related filming and meetings, and in the afternoon, he was to meet with the 'The Island of the Missing' team for the postponed promotional video shoot. 'Oh- crazy. Definitely working past 11 PM.' But at least it wasn't ending at dawn. Woojin decided to think positively. 'What's the use of postponing things that need to be done? Just do it.' Then Jang Su-hwan turned a page in the diary and recited tomorrow's schedule. \\"Tomorrow- in the morning, there's a second advertising meeting with Nongshin for 'Kim's Buckwheat Noodles', and around noon, you'll return to filming 'Leech'.\\" Returning to the filming of 'Leech' was the key for tomorrow. 'It's about 70% done, right?' Soon, Jang Su-hwan closed the diary and smirked. \\"And Hyungnim, before we start the schedule, shall we have a meal? What would you like to eat?\\" Kang Woojin replied with a heavy face, his answer laced with genuine sincerity. \\"Seafood ramen and tuna kimbap.\\" After leaving the shop, Kang Woojin was immediately thrown into his schedule, starting with interviews with media outlets related to 'The Island of the Missing' and various shoots. Time melted away so swiftly that he hardly noticed. As a result, Woojin found himself arriving home just past midnight. \\"Wow- shit, how long has it been since I've been home?\\" He had appeared invincible to others by actively utilizing his pocket dimension, but fatigue was still fatigue. Kang Woojin quickly showered and threw himself into bed. -♬♪ The next day, Woojin's phone alarm rang at 7 AM. However, for the groggy Woojin, it felt like only 7 minutes had passed. \\"Ughhhhhhh-\\" Groaning in pain without his concept, Woojin naturally entered his pocket dimension. And he flopped down. \\"Ah, seriously, the pocket dimension is a lifesaver. I love it.\\" Since time was meaningless in the pocket dimension, Woojin, who had been idly lounging, barely managed to return to reality. Eventually, Kang Woojin. \\"Director! Mr. Kang Woojin has arrived!!\\" Reached the comprehensive set site in Jeonju. Or more precisely, it was the large set of 'Leech'. The hundred or so staff members quickly welcomed Woojin, and the now even older-looking Director Ahn Ga-bok gave Woojin a wrinkled smile. \\"You've arrived, you must have had a hard time, and now I have to make you work hard again.\\" \\"No problem.\\" Kang Woojin returned to the second half of the filming for 'Leech'. Meanwhile. While 'The Island of the Missing' surged again with Kang Woojin's triumphant return, the people involved with 'The Island of the Missing' seemed unsatisfied and accelerated their activities. Around the time Woojin returned to filming 'Leech', Ryu Jung-min and other actors, as well as Director Kwon Ki-taek, added more fuel to the promotional fire. They appeared on various programs. For example, Ryu Jung-min. One of the leads of 'The Island of the Missing', he appeared on an entertainment show that introduced and explored various movies. \\"Ah, that scene was indeed spectacular.\\" \\"Even though I've already seen the movie, I still get goosebumps.\\" \\"But Jung-min, what was the hardest part of filming 'The Island of the Missing' for you?\\" \\"The hardest part? Well, it was mostly fun, but I guess the overseas location shooting was a bit tough.\\" \\"Ah, did you film in Vietnam this time?\\" \\"Da Nang. It was really hot and humid, and there were lots of bugs.\\" \\"Ugh, just hearing that... I really can't stand bugs. Then what's the most memorable thing? The same, Da Nang?\\" \\"No. Honestly, I remember Kang Woojin's acting the most. There's a difference between watching it on screen and seeing it in reality.\\" He was energetically promoting the movie with nostalgia. \\"Ah, right! Shall we also talk about Woojin, who has just returned? His acting was killer. The portrayal of a person with a dual personality was just amazing.\\" \\"When I was watching the movie, the thing that gave me chills was, you know, in 'The Island of the Missing', you see two tendencies in Woojin's acting, right? But as it progressed, I could see the callousness and thought he was really good at acting.\\" \\"What's callousness?\\" \\"It's one of the criteria for diagnosing psychopathy. It's a cold and indifferent response, not exaggerating one's anger or cruelty and being restrained. It's like looking at people but not being interested in their eyes, not recognizing them as people or not caring.\\" \\"Oh- now that you mention it, it's definitely true.\\" \\"I don't know if he studied it, but throughout the movie, Woojin just looked like a real person like that.\\" Ha Yura, Kim Yi-won, and other lead actors did the same. They appeared on YouTube and various programs, putting effort into mid-promotion. Of course, Director Kwon Ki-taek didn't rest either. Thanks to that, not only did the word-of-mouth grow steeply, but there were also audiences who watched 'The Island of the Missing' multiple times. Therefore, although several new competing movies announced their releases. 『Kang Woojin's return effect? 'The Island of the Missing' maintains 'No.1 in reservations' firmly this week as well』 'The Island of the Missing' firmly held its position as 'No.1 in reservations'. June 6th, early morning. BW Entertainment. It was around 8 AM. Although it wasn't quite the start of the workday yet, BW Entertainment's conference room was quite busy. Team leaders and a few employees were busy setting up for the meeting. Roughly a dozen people. \\"Is there a designated seat for the actors?\\" \\"Huh? No, no. Just seat them in a zigzag pattern.\\" \\"Got it!\\" Snacks and bottles of water were placed on the tables, transparent files were set up at each seat, and PPTs were tested. Today's meeting was expected to be attended by all of BW Entertainment's leading actors, including Kang Woojin, Hong Hye-yeon, Ryu Jung-min, and others. It was a simple meeting aimed at the second half of the year. The intention was to share information and review together. At that moment, -Swish. Kang Woojin, who looked even more cynical today due to the warmer weather and simpler attire, appeared in the conference room. His arrival brought smiles to the faces of the team leaders. \\"Ah, Woojin, you're early!\\" \\"You can sit over here!\\" \\"Hahaha, you know you're the main topic of today's agenda, right?\\" After greeting them, Woojin took the seat right next to the head of the table and glanced at the front. 'Should I try some snacks?' Just as Woojin was about to quietly reach for a snack, \\"Hello-\\" A woman's voice echoed throughout the conference room. Looking towards the entrance, Hong Hye-yeon, with her long hair and a white hat pressed down, was waving at the team leaders in a tight beige short-sleeved shirt. For some reason, she had a stack of papers tucked under her arm. After greeting the team leaders, she looked forward and saw Kang Woojin looking back at her nonchalantly. 'She arrived quickly, did she lose some weight?' Muttering to herself, Hong Hye-yeon approached Woojin and pulled out the chair to his right. While doing so, she spoke to Woojin somewhat bluntly. \\"You're still alive? I was starting to worry you were in critical condition since you weren't in touch.\\" Despite the pleasant scent, Woojin, who had restrained himself, replied seriously and lowly. \\"I'm still quite lively.\\" \\"I found out you returned to Korea a few days ago from the news. You do carry your phone with you, right?\\" \\"Yes, right here.\\" \\"......No, I didn't mean to show it to me- Never mind. But you seem to have lost some weight, haven't you?\\" \\"Yes, a little.\\" \\"You know if you collapse because you're already in schedule hell, everything stops, right? I know Woojin doesn't run out of battery, but still, make sure you eat well, okay?\\" Suddenly, Hong Hye-yeon, who had been nagging Woojin, took off her white hat. The sound of her long hair rustling followed, and she looked down at the stack of papers she had brought, then cleared her throat. \\"Ahem! Um, could you take a quick look at this script for me? I like it, but I wonder what you think. Before, it seemed like you could feel something just by looking at the title.\\" Hong Hye-yeon was also one of the believers in the 'Kang Totem'. Then Kang Woojin spoke nonchalantly. \\"Is it for your next project?\\" \\"It's not confirmed yet, I'm just looking at what's come in. I want to do a movie next, something that can lighten my mood a bit. Ah- but if it's too much trouble, I'll handle it myself.\\" \\"Give it to me.\\" Woojin cynically grabbed the stack of papers. However, he was smirking inside. 'If it's a request from Ms. Hong Hye-yeon, of course, it's possible.' Soon, Woojin pretended to open the script while secretly raising his index finger. Naturally, he pressed the black square attached to the script. He entered the pocket dimension in an instant. At the same time, he dropped his concept. \\"It's nice to take a break while I'm here.\\" While it might be a bit cumbersome to read scripts in a row, it wasn't particularly difficult to just take a quick look at the grades in the pocket dimension. After all, the Kang Totem and the crazy vibes were all misconceptions, so it was convenient to bluff. \\"Let's see-\\" Woojin moved in front of the listed white squares and checked the newly listed script. -[11/Script (Title: Stopped by France), B+ Grade] -[*This is a movie script with very high completion. 100% reading is possible.] Just by the title, it was hard to grasp the content. A rom-com? Regardless, Woojin checked the grade. 'B+ grade? That's a bit disappointing.' Or was it actually okay? Recently, Woojin had only been seeing S-grade and above works, so his senses were a bit dulled. S-grade and above works were very rare. A few weeks ago, when Woojin had some spare time, he tested dozens of scripts and scenarios that had poured in like a waterfall in the pocket dimension. The result? 'They were all below C-grade. There was only one decent B-grade.' In other words, works from B to A-grade could also be considered quite decent. In the current entertainment market, they were top-tier. 'Frozen Love', which ended with a 10% viewership, was B+. \\"Well, B+ is manageable. Can I say it's okay?\\" Woojin, who had been stroking his chin and muttering, habitually touched 'the work'. The displayed messages changed. -[11/Script (Title: Stopped by France) has been selected.] -[Listing characters available for reading (experience).] -[A: Kim Sung-jin, B: Choi Geon, C: Dominique Debus......] Woojin paused for a moment. \\"Dominique Debus? Wait, that's a really unusual name, isn't it?\\" Sensing something significant about the name, Woojin moved his index finger without hesitation and selected 'Dominique Debus'. And then, [“......”] A robotic female voice echoed in the silent pocket dimension. [\\"A new language other than the basic language has been detected. 'French' will be acquired first.\\"] Woojin's smile deepened. [\\"Preparing to read 'French'......\\"] [\\"......Preparation complete. Starting to read 'French'.\\"] Just before the grey engulfed him, Woojin murmured with a smile. \\"Nice.\\" < Chronicles (15) > End"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Startled by Nick's sudden collapse, Judy ends up calling an ambulance. The doctors tell Judy that Nick collapsed because he ended up thinking of too much stuff in his thoughts that he ends up causing an overflow, causing his mind to shut down to prevent damage (like a computer crashing). The doctors eventually manage to restart Nick's mind, and he ends up getting up and apologizing to Judy for startling her","output":"Title: The Day Nick Wilde’s Brain Rebooted In the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, Officer Judy Hopps was prancing down the streets with her suave partner-in-crime-solving, the ever-so-clever fox Nick Wilde. They strolled with the ease of seasoned veterans, their banter as light and zippy as the morning breeze that ruffled the fur on their cheeks. Everything was perfectly routine: the vendors were yelling out their daily specials, the tiny rodents whisked by with their little briefcases, and the giraffes were ducking under street signs with the grace of acrobats. \\"Hey, Carrots,\\" Nick said with his trademark smirk. \\"You think Bogo will finally let us work on the big case today?\\" Judy chuckled, twirling her police badge on a finger. \\"Only if you promise not to talk him to sleep with one of your infamous 'Nick's life lessons' again.\\" Just as Nick was about to deliver a delightfully witty retort, his train of thought seemed to derail, his eyes glazed over mid-sentence, and - BAM! - he collapsed onto the pavement like a stack of poker cards hit by a gust of wind. \\"Nick!\\" Judy hopped to his side, her heart thumping like a jackrabbit's. A crowd gathered as she frantically dialed for an ambulance. \\"Hang in there, partner!\\" she shouted, tapping his cheek with a paw. Paramedics arrived, loading Nick onto a stretcher and racing to the hospital with Judy in tow, her police badge clutched in a trembling fist. She could only watch in dismay as her foxy friend lay motionless, whiskers devoid of their usual sass. At the hospital, doctors huddled over Nick, subjecting him to a battery of scans and prods. Judy paced in the waiting room, ears drooping like wilted daisies. What could possibly bring down the slyest mammal in all of Zootopia? Finally, a doctor approached Judy, his brow furrowed in a mix of concern and confusion. \\"Officer Hopps, it appears your partner suffered from what we can only describe as a... cognitive overflow.\\" \\"Cognitive overflow?\\" Judy echoed, her paws wringing together. \\"Yes, it's quite rare, but it seems Mr. Wilde's brain simply had too many thoughts all at once. His mind literally crashed to prevent damage. I suppose it's like how humans say their computers freeze when they have too many tabs open.\\" Judy couldn't help but let out a nervous giggle, imagining Nick's brain juggling a hundred thoughts like a circus clown with too many pies. Thankfully, after what they called a 'neuro-cognitive reboot,' Nick's eyes flickered open, and he yawned like a housecat. \\"Hey, Fluff,\\" he rasped, his voice as smooth as silk. \\"Did I miss the part where it's proved that I'm the brainiest fox around?\\" Judy facepalmed, barely containing her laughter. \\"Oh, Nick. Your brain is so 'powerful' it shut down just to prove it.\\" Nick winced, sitting up on the bed. \\"I was practicing my speech for when we inevitably become ZPD's most decorated officers. It was gonna be epic.\\" Judy hopped up onto the bed and nudged him with an elbow. \\"How about we keep those 'epic speeches' short and sweet, huh? For your health.\\" Nick grinned, rubbing the back of his neck. \\"Deal. But you owe me a jumbo popsicle for all this emotional trauma, Hopps.\\" And so, with a roll of her eyes and a bounding heart, Judy helped her partner stand up. They walked out of the hospital side by side, ready to face whatever else Zootopia had to throw at them – as long as Nick's 'supercomputer' brain kept the tabs to a minimum."},{"instruction":"اريد 30 بوست سوشال ميديا عن وكالة تسويق لتوعية الزبون","output":"1. اكتشف دور وكالة التسويق في توعية الزبون وتحقيق أهدافك. 2. كيف يمكن لوكالة التسويق أن تساعد في رفع مستوى الوعي لدى جمهورك المستهدف؟ 3. استفد من خبرة وكالة التسويق في تحليل سوقك وفهم احتياجات عملائك بشكل أفضل. 4. كن مستعدًا لمشاركة التحديات والفرص التي تواجهها في عملك مع وكالة التسويق الخاصة بك. 5. استفد من استراتيجيات وكالة التسويق لتحسين تجربة العملاء وبناء علاقات قوية معهم. 6. من خلال مشروعات وكالة التسويق، ستكتشف كيفية تعزيز قنوات التفاعل الاجتماعي لعملك. 7. تعرف على استراتيجيات التسويق الرقمي الفعالة التي يتم استخدامها من قبل وكالة التسويق لتوعية الزبون. 8. كن على دراية بأحدث اتجاهات وتطورات سوشال ميديا وكيف يمكن أن تسهم وكالة التسويق في ابتكار محتوى جديد. 9. تعرف على أفضل الأدوات والبرامج التي يستخدمها خبراء التسويق لتحليل وقياس أداء وتأثير الحملات. 10. حلل البيانات والتقارير التي تحصل عليها من وكالة التسويق لتحديد النقاط القوية والضعف في استراتيجيتك الحالية. 11. كيف يمكن لوكالة التسويق أن تساعد في بناء صورة إيجابية لعلامتك التجارية وزيادة الثقة لدى الزبائن. 12. استخدام الاجتماعيات لنشر رسائل توعوية وإلهام الزبائن بفوائد منتجاتك وخدماتك. 13. تعلم كيفية تطوير حملات تسويقية فعالة على منصات التواصل الاجتماعي. 14. تحسين الوصول إلى الزبائن المحتملين وبناء علاقات أقوى من خلال وكالة التسويق. 15. كيف يمكن أن تساعد وكالة التسويق في تصميم وتنفيذ برامج وفعاليات توعوية عبر السوشال ميديا. 16. كيفية قياس وتحسين استجابة الزبائن للحملات التوعوية التي تقدمها وكالة التسويق. 17. تفعل حملة إعلانية مدفوعة الأجر لتعزيز التوعية بمنتجاتك أو خدماتك وقدرات وكالة التسويق على القيام بذلك. 18. تسليط الضوء على المعايير الأخلاقية التي يتبعها وكلاء التسويق في التواصل مع الجمهور. 19. جذب انتباه الزبائن باستخدام استراتيجيات تسويقية مبتكرة وفريدة من وكالة التسويق. 20. تعلم كيفية تحويل الزبائن المحتملين إلى زبائن فعليين باستخدام خدمات وكالة التسويق. 21. كيفية تحقيق تواجد قوي عبر منصات التواصل الاجتماعي مع مساعدة وكالة التسويق. 22. استخدام الاستبيانات والدراسات لتقييم مستوى الوعي لدى الزبائن وقياس تأثير الجهود التسويقية. 23. تعرف على أمثلة على حملات تسويق ناجحة قامت بها وكالات التسويق في تعزيز الوعي لدى الزبائن. 24. من خلال وكالة التسويق، تعرف على أفضل الخطوات والتوجيهات لبناء استراتيجية توعية فعالة. 25. استفد من خبرة خبراء التسويق في خلق محتوى مثير للاهتمام وجذاب يحقق أهدافك في تعزيز الوعي. 26. استكشف الأماكن التي يمكنك استهدافها للتوصل إلى الزبائن المحتملين عن طريق استراتيجيات التسويق عبر السوشال ميديا. 27. تطوير نمط تفاعلي ومستدام مع الزبائن من خلال جهود وكالة التسويق. 28. كيفية قياس وتحسين مستوى الارتباط والتفاعل مع الجمهور من خلال وكالة التسويق. 29. اكتشف كيف يمكن أن تساعد وكالة التسويق في تطوير محتوى قابل للمشاركة والانتشار السريع. 30. استكشف ما يمكن أن تقدمه وكالة التسويق من جديد ومبتكر لتحقيق أهدافك في توعية الزبون."},{"instruction":"Write a list of different ways to refer to Nick Wilde from Zootopia, and for each way to refer to him, the level of seriousness and formality in that way to refer to him","output":"1.

[대한민국 역대 박스오피스] [역대 영화 순위(통합)] -1. 실종의 섬/ 누적관객수: 16,752,991명 1675만. 1675만? 모르겠다. 내가 보고 있는 게 현실이 맞나? “역대···1위. 내가? 내가 찍은 영화가? 미친.” 들었던 핸드폰을 툭 하고 내리며 우진이 정면 쪽 허공을 바라봤다. 동공이 확장됐다. 더불어 심장 박동도 커졌다. 당연히 고대한 순간이긴 했으나 막상 닥치니 안 믿겼기 때문이다. 인간이란 때때로 퍽 간절했던 게 이뤄지면 현실을 부정하기도 한다. 그러나 강우진의 현재는 바뀔 리가 없다. 대한민국 영화계의 기나긴 역사가 뒤집혔고 그 바뀐 역사의 부스터를 달아 준건 강우진이었다. 서서히. “크크.” 점차. “후훗.” 현실을 받아들인 강우진. 그의 양쪽 입꼬리가 사정없이 올라가기 시작했다. 변화가 급작스럽다. 뜬금 웃은 탓에 대놓고 미친놈처럼 보일 지경이었다. 뭐 어때. 우진은 미친놈으로 보이기로 작정했는지. -스윽. 산발인 머리인 채 침대서 일어나서는 돌연 엉덩이를 씰룩였다. 아니, 엉덩이만이 아니었다. 허리와 어깨 쪽 등 몸뚱이 전체를 리듬에 맡겼다. “봤냐? 봤냐고. 이게 나야.” 덩실덩실 또는 씰룩씰룩. 물론, 음악은 깔리지 않았다. 그저 흥분되는 기분에 취해 흔들어 재끼는 거였다. 컨셉질? 쎈척? 몰라, 그냥 춤이나 갈겨. 흥분이 가중되는 강우진. 뭐 다분히 이해되는 행동이었다. 굳이 우진만이 아닌, 보통의 배우라도 그랬을 테니까. 철옹성 같던 한국의 역대 1위 영화를 갈아 치웠다. 이만한 영광이 또 어딨겠는가? 특히 강우진의 경우 ‘실종의 섬’이 장편 영화로서 첫 주연이었고, 그가 대히트를 치며 이뤄낸 쾌거였다. 심지어 원샷 원킬. ‘이슈왕’으로만이 아닌 실질적인 영향력을 증명한 셈이었다. 다만, 현재 반쯤 미친 강우진은 저런 구구절절한 의미보단 그저 1위 한 게 기분이 좋았다. 그런 강우진이 돌연 우뚝 멈췄다. “후-” 작게 숨을 고르던 그가 처음 아공간을 습득했을 때를 떠올렸다. 정확하게는 그쯤 반 장난식으로 읊조렸던 본인의 대사였다. ‘배우나 해볼까?’ 그랬던 것이 현재는 천만 배우가 됐다. 아니, 그 이상이지. 디자인회사의 두꺼비 사장에게 사표를 던지고 백수가 됐던 강우진은, 이 시점 부로 대한민국 역대 1위 영화의 주연 배우였다. -우우웅 -우우웅 -우우웅 짧은 진동이 울려댔다. 쉴 새 없이. 침대 위 핸드폰이 뱉는 것이다. 타이밍상 100% 축하 연락들이겠지. 하지만 우진은 바로 핸드폰을 집지 않았다. “훗, 좀만 더 흔들어 재껴야지.” 벅차오르는 흥분도를 몇 분 더 즐길 생각이었으니까. 허나. -똑똑, 똑똑똑똑! 그의 룸 문을 누군가 게걸스럽게 두드리는 바람에 우진은 멈춰야 했다. 아 잠깐만. 누구인지는 둘째치고 지금은 내팽개친 컨셉질부터 다시 써야 했다. 마인드 컨트롤, 포커페이스. 침착해라, 강우진이여. 정신없이 입꼬리가 올라가지만 우진은 어떻게든 보통의 무심함을 얼굴에 붙였다. 재차 거울로 얼굴을 확인한 우진이 문을 열었다. 동시에. “하하! 우진아!!” 살짝 흐트러진 꽁지머리의 최성건이 느닷없이 강우진을 와락 안았다. 호텔이라 그런지 살짝 이상한 그림이 연출됐지만, 우진의 무표정은 달라지지 않았고 최성건이 그의 등을 두드리며 외쳤다. “1위다, 1위! 것도 그냥 1위여??! 아니지! 한국 역사를 싹- 갈아엎고 1위다!! 너 임마! 이제 배우로서 격이 달라진 거라고!!” bw 엔테 대표지만, 최성건은 아주 솔직하게 기뻐하고 있었다. 그럴 만했다. 그 역시 강우진의 첫 시발점부터 같이 했으니까. 물론, 숱한 오해와 착각이 가미된 동행이었으나 상관은 없다. 어쨌든 최성건의 등을 적당히 두드린 강우진은 목소리를 깔았다. “아직 멀었습니다.” 뒤로. 강우진이 ‘거머리’ 세트장으로 움직임과 동시에 한국의 영화 역사가 뒤바꾼 시각. 격한 호들갑을 떠는 것은 최성건만이 아니었다. 국내 전체가 흔들리고 있다 봐도 과언이 아닐 정도였다. 특히, ‘실종의 섬’ 키스탭과 권기택 감독 등이 모인 어울림 영화사는. “으아아악!!” “축하드립니다! 축하드려요!!” “지, 진짭니까 이거?? 보고 있는데도 안 믿기는데요??!” “와!! 소름! 팔뚝에 소름이!!” “감독님! 정말 축하드립니다!” “‘실종의 섬’이- 1위! 1위라니!!” “야야, 누가 내 엉덩이 좀 때려봐! 꿈 아니지? 어??!” 요동치고 있었다. 방방 뛰거나 서로서로 얼싸안으며 울부짖었다. 다분히 이해되는 광경이었다. 1000만 영화도 파급력이 센데, 1600만을 넘어 1위를 탈환했고 심지어 아직 종합 성적은 끝나지 않았다. “대박!! 아니지! 초대박! 아니다!! 전설! 레전듭니다!!” 광란의 파티장을 연상케 하는 분위기. 그사이 자리에 앉은, 푸근한 인상의 권기택 감독은 나지막한 숨을 뱉으며 읊조렸다. “그래, 이 맛.” 많은 장면이 그의 머릿속에 스쳤다. 처음 ‘실종의 섬’ 시나리오를 적던 때, 완성 후 어울리는 배우들을 서치하던 때, 하늘에서 급작스레 뚝 떨어진 강우진, 1년 차 신인에게 주연을 줬던 때 등등. “역시- 이 맛에 연출을 못 그만두는 거야.” 평소 나긋나긋하던 거장 권기택 감독이 양손 모두 주먹을 움켜쥐었다. 나름의 전율을 표한 것이었다. ‘실종의 섬’의 주연 배우들도 같았다. 어울림 영화사에 있지는 않지만 모든 배우는 각자의 위치에서 기뻐하고 있었다. 류정민, 전우창, 하유라, 김이원 등 ‘실종의 섬’에 출연한 조연들부터 보출들까지. 반면, 어울림 영화사나 배우들과는 정반대로 지옥길을 걷는 영화사도 존재했다. “후, 결국엔.” “······음.” “각오는 했다만 역시- 기분은 별롭니다.” “어쩌겠나. 현실인걸.” 어디겠는가? ‘해전’을 제작한 ‘BOX 무비스’ 쪽이었다. 왁자지껄 어울림 영화사와 비교한다면 이쪽은 초상집이었다. 침울하기 짝이 없다. 아마 국내 전체로 봤을 때도 ‘BOX 무비스’ 영화사가 가장 침통하겠지. 실제로 이미 언론은 미친 듯이 또는 신명나게 기사를 갈기고 있었으니까. 『[공식]‘실종의 섬’, 역대 1위 ‘해전’ 제치고 왕좌 꿰찼다!』 『오늘부터 역대 1위 영화는 ‘해전’이 아닌 ‘실종의 섬’, 뒤바뀐 순위에 국내 영화계 들썩』 『“초대박!” 수년 만에 바뀐 한국의 1위, 하지만 ‘실종의 섬’의 질주는 끝나지 않았다』 오늘만큼은 그 어떤 찌라시나 까는 것 없이 대부분의 언론이 ‘실종의 섬’을 축하했다. 『‘강우진’ 효과 톡톡히···1위 탈환한 ‘실종의 섬’ 1800만 관객수 가능할까?』 분위기가 달아오른다. 연예계가 들썩였다. 라디오 등의 각종 매체들이 앞다퉈 ‘실종의 섬’의 소식을 전했다. “이야- ‘실종의 섬’이 진짜 해냈습니다! 권기택 감독님 축하드리고, 배우님들도 축하드려요!” “대단하네요. 솔직히 앞으로 ‘해전’의 성적을 깨는 영화가 안 나올 줄 알았거든요? 근데- 시원하게 1600만 관객수를 넘겨버렸어요.” “근데 더 놀라운 건 그 성적이 최종 스코어가 아니라는 거잖아요.” “그러니까요.” 물론, 너튜브나 영상 플랫폼 또는 SNS 등도 널뛰었다. 커뮤니티 등 여론은 어떠한가? -와!!! 축하드립니다!! 짝짝짝!! -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅁㅊ진짜로 실종이 섬이 해전을 밟아버리넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ왘ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -.....근데 솔까 실종의 섬이 1700만 가까운 영화였냐? 난 씹노잼이었는데 -↑씹노잼인 건 니 면상 -근데 와.....강우진은 대체 어찌되는 거임? 데뷔 2년 차에 사고 제대로 쳤네 -과거도 아니고 현재에 1600만 관객수인 건 진심 개대박인거임ㅋㅋㅋ -거품 영홬ㅋㅋㅋㅋ운이 좋았음 강우진 화력도 한 몫했곸ㅋㅋㅋ 그들 역시 흥분도가 극에 달했다. -권감독은 실종의 섬 하나로 국내 감독 중에 명실상부 1등 감독으로 우뚝ㅎㅎㅎ -배우들 돈파티하겠다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ개부럽 -강우진 ㅁㅊㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ필모 개쩌넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -역대 1위 영화가 바뀐 역사의 날!! -지리는 거 알려드림? 강우진 지금 칸 준비중ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -그치...어디 업계든 물이 썩으면 안 되지..계속 변화가 있어야 됨 -해전 배우들은 개빡칠듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -실종의 섬 존잼!!! 와중, ‘거머리’ 세트장에 도착한 강우진에게도 무수한 축하가 쏟아졌다. 심한호, 오희령, 진재준, 한소진 등 배우들은 물론이며 백여 명 스탭들까지. 마치 자기의 일인양 기뻐하는 게 눈에 선하다. 물론, 노장 안가복 감독 역시 우진에게 축하를 전했다. “우진군, 대단한 업적을 남겼어. 축하하네.” 동시에 의지를 더욱 다졌다. “우리 ‘거머리’도 칸에서 제대로 사고 쳐야지?” 그렇게 주말이 섞인 이틀이 흘렀다. 12일과 13일이 삭제되고 14일에 밝았고, 바뀐 한국 역대 1위 영화는. [대한민국 역대 박스오피스] [역대 영화 순위(통합)] -1. 실종의 섬/ 누적관객수: 17,681,238명 철옹성을 정립하는 중이었다. 한편, 14일 월요일. 일본. 다시금 평일이 밝았을 즈음 일본에도 한국영화계의 왕좌가 바꾼 것을 보도하고 있었다. 『「강우진」주연작 ‘실종의 섬’, 한국 역대 영화 순위 1위 등극』 『「강우진」의 독보적 행보, ‘실종의 섬’ 1위 소식에 일본 팬들 열광』 당연히 한국보다야 약하지만 그래도 강우진이 포함된 소식이라 그런지 퍽 시끄럽게 뿌려댄다. 그에 따라 일본 SNS에서도 우진의 이름은 자주 언급되는 중이었다. 특이한 건 한 편집실에서도 우진의 이름이 자주 대두된다는 것. 바로 일본 TOP3 애니 제작사인 ‘A10 스튜디오’였다. 명확하게는 ‘A10 스튜디오’ 안에 있는 대형 편집실. 각종 기기들과 수많은 모니터들이 달린 곳이었고 편집실엔 꽤 익숙한 인물들이 자리했다. 애니 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 총괄 감독과 여러 스탭들. 이유야 간단했다. 강우진 포함 성우들의 더빙을 마쳤으니 이제 남은 건 마무리 편집뿐이니까. 자리 중앙에 앉은 감독이 진두지휘하고. “오프닝곡 다시 틀어봐요.” “예, 감독님.” 넓은 편집실엔 곡 하나가 울리기 시작했다. -♬♪ 강우진이 소화한 OST 곡이었다. 적당히 빠른 비트에 피아노 선율과 드럼이 섞였다. 더불어 정면에 달린 많은 모니터에는 OST와 합쳐질, 애니의 오프닝 컷들이 교차로 출력되기 시작했다. 감독이 뽑은 ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 여러 씬들. 이쯤. “······와.” 감독의 옆에 앉은 여자 스탭이 감탄 섞인 일본어를 뱉었다. “강우진씨는 노래도 엄청 잘하시네요. 보이스도 좋고. 우진씨라고 말 안 하면 그냥 가수로 느끼겠어요.” 이 말이 시발탄이 되어 편집실에 몰린 대부분의 스탭들이 극찬에 끼었다. “맞아요, 일본어도 전혀 어색한 느낌도 없고.” “우진씨 너튜브에서도 몇 번 듣긴 했는데- 역시 또 들어도 놀랍네요.” “못하는 게 없는 걸까요?” 중앙에 앉은 감독이 천천히 고개를 끄덕였다. “나도 처음 미팅했을 땐 많이 놀랐어요.” 그렇게 애니의 오프닝곡을 확인하던 감독이 이번엔 다른 것을 주문했다. “피아노 딴 것도 들어봅시다.” 금세 편집실에 울리던 곡이 바뀐다. 강우진이 친 피아노였다. 애니의 초반부에 삽입될 컷이었고. “아무리 봐도 우진씨는 과거에 음악적 활동을 활발하게 하신 거 같아요.” “역시 그렇겠죠? 이만한 보컬에 피아노까지.” “근데 연기까지 신들렸잖아요? 거기다 성우 스킬까지 가지고 계시고.” “듣고 보니···대체 뭐지? 이 외계인은? 보통이라면 하나 가지는 것도 평생이 걸릴지도 모르는데.” 팔짱 낀 채 피아노 선율을 듣던 감독이 작게 읊조렸다. 톤이 확정적이었고. “······타고난 천재성에 피나는. 아니 피를 토하는 노력이 있었겠죠. 그게 아니면 설명이 안 돼. 모르긴 몰라도 우진씨는 지금껏 인생을 단 1초도 허비하지 않았을 겁니다.” 편집실 모두가 인정했다. “괴물이네요, 역시.” 후로 흐른 시각이 대략 수 시간. 아침이었던 하늘이 어둑어둑해졌을 때쯤, ‘남사친: 리메이크’의 편집이 한창인 편집실로 여자 한 명이 들어왔다. ‘A10 스튜디오’ 기획팀 여자 팀장이었다. 그녀가 들어오자 스탭 몇몇이 인사했고, 기기 중앙에 앉은 감독에게 붙은 여자 팀장이 말했다. “감독님, 어떤가요?” 하품을 쩍 하던 감독이 기기를 몇 번 조작하더니, 편집을 마친 ‘남사친: 리메이크’ 1화를 모니터에 띄웠다. 곧, 여자 팀장의 시선은 모니터에 고정됐고 한참을 보다가 비죽 웃었다. “좋아요, 벌써 두근두근하네. 특히 강우진씨는 진짜 남주 ‘센고쿠 토오루’ 그 자체네요.” 만족이 얼굴에 가득한 여자 팀장이 감독에게 눈동자를 내렸고. “‘남사친: 리메이크’ 방영 일정이 잡혀서 말씀드리려구요.” 확정된 것을 읊었다. “올해 3분기, 7월쯤으로 나갈 거예요.” 대략 한 달 남았다. < 역사 (2) > 끝","output":"< History (2) > It's done. Really done. The moment when the history of all South Korean movies changed, the moment when it climbed to number one, surpassing countless formidable movies, the moment when it seized the throne that was beyond imagination. \\"......\\" Surprisingly, Kang Woojin did not react immediately. He just looked down at the phone in his hand with a slightly dazed expression. His hair was disheveled and messy, as if his mind had gone blank. Of course, that wasn't entirely wrong. Woojin's current thoughts were a bit broken. [South Korea's All-Time Box Office] [All-Time Movie Rankings (Integrated)] -1. The Island of the Missing / Cumulative Audience: 16,752,991 16.75 million. 16.75 million? I don't know. Is what I'm seeing real? \\"All-time... 1st place. Me? My movie? Crazy.\\" Woojin looked up into the air in front of him as he casually dropped the phone he was holding. His pupils dilated. His heartbeat also increased. It was a moment he had long anticipated, but now that it was here, he couldn't believe it. Sometimes, when humans achieve what they desperately wished for, they deny reality. However, Kang Woojin's present cannot be changed. The long history of South Korea's film industry was overturned, and Kang Woojin was the booster that changed that history. Slowly. \\"Keke.\\" Gradually. \\"Huhuh.\\" Kang Woojin, who accepted reality. The corners of his mouth began to rise uncontrollably. The change was abrupt. He laughed out of the blue, looking almost like a madman. So what. Woojin seemed determined to look like a madman. -Swish. With his disheveled hair, he got up from the bed and suddenly started to wiggle his hips. No, not just his hips. He let his whole body, including his waist and shoulders, follow the rhythm. \\"See that? Do you see? This is me.\\" Dancing or wiggling. Of course, there was no music playing. He was just shaking with excitement. Pretending to be cool? Acting tough? I don't know, just dance. Kang Woojin's excitement intensified. It was a behavior that was quite understandable. Any ordinary actor would have done the same. He had replaced the number one movie in Korea, which had seemed impregnable. What greater honor could there be? Especially for Kang Woojin, 'The Island of the Missing' was his first leading role in a feature film, and it was a great success he had achieved. Even a one-shot, one-kill. He proved his actual influence, not just as an 'Issue King.' However, the currently half-mad Kang Woojin cared less about such detailed meanings and was simply happy to be number one. Suddenly, Kang Woojin stopped. \\"Hoo-\\" He took a small breath and remembered the first time he acquired the subspace. More precisely, it was his own line that he had recited half-jokingly around that time. 'Should I try acting?' What was once a thought had now become a reality as a ten-million actor. No, more than that. Kang Woojin, who had quit his job at a design company and became unemployed, was now the leading actor of South Korea's all-time number one movie. -Woong Woong Woong -Woong Woong Woong -Woong Woong Woong Short vibrations rang out incessantly. It was coming from the phone on the bed. Given the timing, they were probably 100% congratulatory messages. But Woojin did not immediately pick up the phone. \\"Huh, I should shake it off a bit more.\\" He intended to enjoy the rising excitement for a few more minutes. However. -Knock knock, knock knock knock! Someone knocked on his room door greedily, forcing Woojin to stop. Wait a minute. Regardless of who it was, he had to pick up the concept he had thrown away earlier. Mind control, poker face. Stay calm, Kang Woojin. Despite his lips rising uncontrollably, Woojin managed to put an ordinary indifference on his face. After checking his face in the mirror again, Woojin opened the door. At the same time. \\"Haha! Woojin!!\\" Choi Seonggeon, with his slightly disheveled ponytail, suddenly hugged Kang Woojin. It was a slightly strange scene because it was a hotel, but Woojin's expressionless face did not change, and Choi Seonggeon patted his back and shouted. \\"It's number one, number one! And not just any number one?! No! You've completely overturned Korean history and taken number one!! You, man! You've changed your status as an actor!!\\" Choi Seonggeon, the representative of bw Entertainment, was genuinely happy. It was understandable. He had been with Kang Woojin from the very beginning. Of course, their journey was filled with numerous misunderstandings and misconceptions, but that didn't matter. Kang Woojin patted Choi Seonggeon's back appropriately and spoke. \\"We still have a long way to go.\\" Backwards. As Kang Woojin moved to the 'Leech' set, the moment when Korea's film history was overturned. It wasn't just Choi Seonggeon who was making a fuss. The whole country was shaking, to the point where it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say so. Especially at Eoullim Film Company, where the key staff and director Kwon Gitaek of 'The Island of the Missing' were gathered. \\"Aaaah!!\\" \\"Congratulations! Congratulations!!\\" \\"Is this real?? I can't believe it even though I'm looking at it??!\\" \\"Wow!! Goosebumps! Goosebumps on my arms!!\\" \\"Director! Congratulations!\\" \\"'The Island of the Missing' is- number one! Number one!!\\" \\"Hey, someone hit my butt! This isn't a dream, right? Huh??!\\" They were in an uproar. They jumped around and hugged each other, screaming. It was a scene that was quite understandable. A movie with 10 million viewers already has a significant impact, but surpassing 16 million and taking the top spot, and the overall results were not even finished yet. \\"Jackpot!! No, it's a mega jackpot! No!! It's a legend! Legendary!!\\" The atmosphere was reminiscent of a wild party. Meanwhile, director Kwon Gitaek, who sat down with a gentle demeanor, exhaled a low breath and murmured. \\"Yeah, this is the taste.\\" Many scenes flashed through his mind. The time when he first wrote the screenplay for 'The Island of the Missing,' the time when he searched for suitable actors after completion, the time when Kang Woojin suddenly fell from the sky, the time when he gave the lead role to a first-year rookie, and so on. \\"Indeed- this is why I can't quit directing.\\" Director Kwon Gitaek, who was usually gentle, clenched both fists. It was his way of showing a thrill. The lead actors of 'The Island of the Missing' felt the same. Although they were not at Eoullim Film Company, all the actors were happy in their respective places. Ryu Jungmin, Jeon Woochang, Ha Yura, Kim Iwon, and other supporting actors and extras who appeared in 'The Island of the Missing'. On the other hand, there was a film company walking the path of hell, completely opposite to Eoullim Film Company and the actors. \\"Alas, in the end.\\" \\"......Hmm.\\" \\"I was prepared, but still- it feels quite bitter.\\" \\"What can we do? It's reality.\\" Where else could it be? It was 'BOX Movies', the producer of 'Naval Battle'. If compared to the bustling Eoullim Film Company, this place was like a funeral home. It was utterly gloomy. Probably, 'BOX Movies' was the most sorrowful place in the entire country. In fact, the media was already frantically or excitedly churning out articles. \\"[Official] 'The Island of the Missing' dethrones 'Naval Battle' and seizes the throne!\\" \\"From today, the number one movie of all time is not 'Naval Battle' but 'The Island of the Missing', the film industry is buzzing with the changed rankings\\" \\"“Mega hit!” Korea's number one has changed after years, but 'The Island of the Missing' is not done yet\\" For today, almost all media outlets congratulated 'The Island of the Missing' without any negative or critical articles. \\"'Kang Woojin' effect pays off... 'The Island of the Missing' takes number one, can it reach 18 million viewers?\\" The atmosphere was heating up. The entertainment industry was bustling. Various media such as radio were eagerly reporting the news of 'The Island of the Missing'. \\"Wow- 'The Island of the Missing' really did it! Congratulations to director Kwon Gitaek and all the actors!\\" \\"It's amazing. Honestly, I thought no movie would break 'Naval Battle's record in the future. But- they've cleanly surpassed 16 million viewers.\\" \\"But what's even more surprising is that this isn't the final score.\\" \\"That's right.\\" Of course, YouTube, video platforms, and SNS were also fluctuating. What about the public opinion in communities? -Wow!!! Congratulations!! Clap clap clap!! -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅁㅊ for real, 'The Island of the Missing' stepped on 'Naval Battle'ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -.....But honestly, was 'The Island of the Missing' a movie close to 17 million? I thought it was super boring -↑The super boring thing is your face -But wow.....what's going to happen to Kang Woojin? He really made a big hit in his second year of debut -It's not the past, but 16 million viewers right now is seriously a mega hitㅋㅋㅋ -Bubble movieㅋㅋㅋㅋIt was lucky, Kang Woojin's firepower also played a partㅋㅋㅋ They were also at the peak of excitement. -Kwon director has become the undisputed number one director in Korea with just 'The Island of the Missing'ㅎㅎㅎ -The actors are going to have a money partyㅋㅋㅋㅋ so jealous -Kang Woojin ㅁㅊㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ his filmography is amazingㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -The day the number one movie in history changed!! -It's legendary? Kang Woojin is preparing for Cannes right nowㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -That's right...in any industry, the water shouldn't stagnate..there needs to be continuous change -'Naval Battle' actors must be pissedㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -'The Island of the Missing' is awesome!!! Meanwhile, Kang Woojin, who arrived at the 'Leech' set, also received countless congratulations. Actors such as Sim Hanho, Oh Heeryung, Jin Jaejoon, Han Sojin, as well as about a hundred staff members. It was clear that they were happy as if it were their own achievement. Of course, veteran director An Gabok also congratulated Woojin. \\"Woojin, you've achieved a great feat. Congratulations.\\" At the same time, he strengthened his resolve. \\"Let's make a big hit at Cannes with 'Leech', shall we?\\" Thus, two days, including the weekend, passed. The 12th and 13th were gone, and it was the 14th, and the changed number one movie in Korea was. [South Korea's All-Time Box Office] [All-Time Movie Rankings (Integrated)] -1. The Island of the Missing / Cumulative Audience: 17,681,238 It was establishing itself as an impregnable fortress. On the other hand, Monday, the 14th, in Japan. As the weekday dawned, Japan was also reporting the change in the throne of the Korean film industry. 『'Kang Woojin' starring 'The Island of the Missing', ascends to number one in Korea's all-time movie rankings』 『'Kang Woojin's' unique trajectory, Japanese fans ecstatic over 'The Island of the Missing' taking number one』 Naturally, the reaction was weaker than in Korea, but still, the news involving Kang Woojin was quite noisy. Interestingly, Woojin's name was also frequently mentioned in an editing room in Japan. It was 'A10 Studio', one of Japan's TOP3 animation studios. More specifically, a large editing room within 'A10 Studio'. The room was filled with various devices and numerous monitors, and familiar figures were seated in the editing room. They were the general director of the anime 'Male Friend: Remake' and several staff members. The reason was simple. Since the dubbing with Kang Woojin and other voice actors was finished, all that was left was the final editing. The director in the center of the room was leading the work. \\"Play the opening song again.\\" \\"Yes, director.\\" A song began to play in the spacious editing room. -♬♪ It was the OST song performed by Kang Woojin. It had a moderately fast beat mixed with piano melodies and drums. Additionally, many monitors in front of them began to display the opening cuts of the anime that would be combined with the OST. Various scenes from 'Male Friend: Remake' selected by the director. At this point. \\"......Wow.\\" A female staff member sitting next to the director exclaimed in Japanese, filled with admiration. \\"Kang Woojin is really good at singing. His voice is also nice. If you didn't tell me it was Woojin, I would think he's just a singer.\\" This comment sparked a wave of praise among most of the staff gathered in the editing room. \\"That's right, his Japanese doesn't feel awkward at all.\\" \\"I've heard Woojin on YouTube a few times, but- it's still surprising every time I hear it.\\" \\"Is there anything he can't do?\\" The director, with his arms crossed, listening to the piano melody, murmured softly. His tone was definitive. \\"......A born genius and bloody, no, blood-spitting effort must have been there. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense. Although I don't know for sure, Woojin must have not wasted even a single second of his life.\\" Everyone in the editing room agreed. \\"He's a monster, indeed.\\" Hours passed. When the sky, which had been morning, began to darken, a woman entered the editing room, which was busy with the editing of 'Male Friend: Remake'. She was the female team leader of the 'A10 Studio' planning team. As she entered, a few staff members greeted her, and the female team leader approached the director in the center of the equipment and said. \\"Director, how is it?\\" The director, who yawned widely, manipulated a few devices and then displayed the edited first episode of 'Male Friend: Remake' on the monitor. Soon, the female team leader's gaze was fixed on the monitor, and after watching for a while, she smiled slightly. \\"It's good, I'm already excited. Especially Kang Woojin, he's really the embodiment of the male lead 'Sengoku Tooru'.\\" The female team leader, with satisfaction all over her face, looked down at the director. \\"I came to tell you that the airing schedule for 'Male Friend: Remake' has been set.\\" She recited what had been confirmed. \\"It's going to be around the third quarter of this year, around July.\\" About a month was left. < History (2) > End"},{"instruction":"< 숨통 (1) > 밤, ‘거머리’ 세트장에 확성기를 통한 안가복 감독의 늙은 목소리가 퍼졌다. “컷, OK.” 동시에 세트를 둘러싸고 있던 백여 명 스탭들이 격렬한 박수를 쳐댔다. -짝짝짝짝짝짝! -짝짝짝짝짝짝짝! 그리곤 대부분이 홀가분하게 외쳐댔다. “크으으으!! 드디어!!” “으아!! 끝났다아!!” “진짜 고생들 많으셨습니다!” “수고하셨습니다! 수고하셨습니다!!” “고생 많으셨어요!!” 백여 명 스탭들의 함성 덕에 종합세트장이 떠나가라 울린다. 물론, 대기하고 있던 심한호나 오희령 등 배우들도 웃음을 지으며 함성에 참여했다. 세트 안에 있던 강우진과 진재준 역시 그랬다. 전부 꾸벅꾸벅 정신없이 인사했고 그 모습을 출입 기자들이 찍었다. 물론, 메이킹 팀도 바삐 움직인다. 방방 뛰거나 덩실덩실 어깨춤 추는 스탭들의 얼굴엔 환희, 전율, 기쁨, 감격 등의 감정이 서렸다. 충분히 이해될 순간이었다. 지금 방금 ‘거머리’의 모든 촬영이 종료됐으니까. 와중 반쯤 미친 스탭들을 물끄러미 보던, 모니터 앞에 앉은 안가복 감독은 등을 의자에 움푹 기대며 긴 한숨을 내쉬었다. “이제 한고비 넘겼구만.” 이때. “감독님.” 흥분에 젓은 스탭들 사이를 뚫고 등장한 강우진이 안가복 감독에게 인사했다. 당연히 포커페이스가 짙다. “고생 많으셨습니다, 먼저 빠져야 될 것 같아서 인사드리려고.” 우진은 ‘강우진 부캐’ 관련으로 스케줄이 하나 더 남아 있었다. 곧, 안가복 감독이 주름진 손을 강우진에게 내밀었고. “아직 끝난 건 아니지마는, 그래요. 우진군도 고생 많았어. 그리고.” 남은 손을 든 안가복 감독이 엄지를 보였다. “마지막 씬, 기가 막혔어.” “감사합니다.” “아쉽구만. 뒤풀이로 회식도 있고 좀 쉬어도 될 텐데 말이지.” 적당히 대화를 마친 안가복 감독이 우진의 어깨를 두드렸고, 백여 명 스탭들에게 인사를 마친 강우진은 배우진들에게도 마무리 인사를 던졌다. 뒤로 우진과 그의 팀만이 ‘거머리’의 현장에서 벗어나기 시작했다. 그런 강우진의 뒷모습을 가만- 히 보던 대배우 심한호. “······” 명확하게는 우진이 보였던 마지막 씬을 상기하는 거였다. ‘시나리오 분석을 넘어 연출까지 생각하는 여유가 있는 건가? 점점 더 무서워 지고 있어.’ 이때 심한호의 귓가에 여자 목소리가 끼었다. 우아한 미소가 돋보이는 오희령이었다. “뭘 그렇게 봐요? 넋이 나갔네, 선배?” “음? 아. 아니야.” 고개를 젓는 심한호의 시선을 따르던 오희령이 멀어진 강우진을 발견했다. 알만 하다는 듯한 얼굴로 변한 오희령이 팔짱을 꼈다. “마지막 컷은 진짜 소름이 돋던데요? 선배는 어땠어.” “······기발했지. 늙은 나는 생각조차 못 했고.” “뭘 또 그렇게까지. 선배는 선배의 것이 있고 카리스마가 있잖아요. 결이 다른 거지.” “격이 다르다고 말해도 이상하지 않아.” “뭐야? 선배 그런 캐릭터 아니잖아요.” “그저 저 친구한테는 한국이 좁다는 얘길 하는 거야.” 아하- 따위의 대답을 뱉은 오희령이 다시금 멀어진 강우진 쪽을 바라보며. “하여튼 우진씨 마지막 씬은 진짜- 뭐랄까, 연기가 아니라 작품 속 ‘박하성’이 현실에 나와서 뛰어노는 것 같았어요.” 픽 웃었다. “캐릭터가 현실에 나와 노는 건데 격이 다를 수밖에.” 몇십 분 뒤, 강우진의 밴. 한창 고속도로를 달리고 있는 강우진의 밴. 우진의 현장을 벗어난 지는 이미 30분 정도가 지난 상태였다. -부웅! 커다란 밴이 배기음을 내며 내달리는 와중 밴의 내부는 왁자지껄했다. 물론, 우진의 팀 인원들이 축포를 터트리고 있는 것. 반면, 주인공인 강우진은. “······” 강우진 딱히 입을 열진 않았다. 마음 같아서는 당장에 참여하고 싶지만, 그저 굳건한 컨셉질을 가미한 채 핸드폰을 볼 뿐. 물론, 강우진이 보는 인터넷엔 잠시간의 느긋함이 보이지 않았다. ‘와- 씨! 이쪽도 난리 났네, 난리 났어.’ 여러 기사 폭탄들이 투하되고 있었으니까. 물론, 지금 강우진이 감탄한 것처럼 그와 관련된 소식이 제일 많이 보였다. 『[이슈픽]공식 캐스팅 발표한 ‘이로운 악’, 그런데 무명·신인이 왜 이렇게 많지?』 먼저, 오늘 아침에 공식적인 배우 캐스팅이 발표된 ‘이로운 악’. 시간이 지남에 따라 이슈로 홍수처럼 불어났다. 물론, 첫 출처는 ‘이로운 악’의 넷플렉스와 DM 프로덕션이었지만, 지금은 쏘아진 떡밥을 주운 기자들이 정신없이 비슷한 기사를 복붙하고 있었다. 『영화계 역사 만든 ‘강우진’의 기대작 ‘이로운 악’, 캐스팅 까니 여론은 고개 갸웃』 ‘이로운 악’은 제작 정식 발표 때도 거물 송만우 PD나 강우진 등으로 눈길을 끌었고, 국내 방송사가 아닌 넷플렉스를 통해 전세계를 노린다는 이슈로 인지도가 급상승한 바가 있다. 그렇기에 언론의 가열됨은 이상하지 않았다. 그런 언론이 이번 ‘이로운 악’의 확정 캐스팅보드에서 가장 큰 의문을 가진 것은 역시나 무명, 신인 배우들이 많이 보인다는 것. 아직 주연부터 조·단역까지, 캐스팅 배우들이 무슨 역을 맡았는지는 밝히지 않았다만 그 수가 보통의 작품과 비교하면 퍽 다수였다. 따라서 많은 추측들이 범람했다. 세계를 노리는 것이니 국내는 버리는 것인가? 세트나 연출에 힘을 주느라 자금이 많이 부족했나? 또 다른 도전을 이루려는 것인가? 가뜩이나 ‘이로운 악’은 사전 제작 작품이었다. 정보가 부족하다. 보통 사전 제작은 떡밥은 무수하나 대외비가 많기 때문이었다. 곧, 강우진은 숱한 기사들을 훑으면서 속으로 읊조렸다. ‘별별 잡소리 개소리들 씨불이네. 어차피 해외 노리니까 무명들 잡아서 돈 아낀다는 말은 진심 개쌉소리 아니냐??’ 어이가 없긴 했다만 그리 짜증 나진 않았다. 나름 우진도 보는 눈이 적응됐으니까. 뭐, 그렇다고 하여 파급력 높은 탑들이 전혀 없는 것도 아니긴 했다. 강우진과 연이 깊은 화린이나 ‘우리네 식탁’을 같이 했던 하강수 등등, 진행될 에피소드마다 탑부터 A급 이상의 배우들이 포진됐다. 하지만 언론의 기대와는 상반되는 캐스팅보드임은 틀림없다. 그들이 보기에 숱한 히트작을 낳은 뒤, 직전에 ‘프로파일러 한량’으로 전설을 남긴 송만우 PD라면 탑들이 줄줄 일 거로 생각했을 테니까. 거기다 전세계를 노린다고 안 했던가? 배치된 조건이나 거물들을 놓고 보면 무명, 신인이 많은 현 상황은 살짝 미적지근하겠지. 이는 비단 언론만이 아니라 이슈의 냄새를 맡고 움직이는 각종 너튜버들도 비슷했다. 우진은 무심한 얼굴로 달린 대중들의 반응을 확인했다. -이로운 악 이거 생각보다 신인들 엄청 많이 캐스팅했넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ기사보니까 돈 없어서 그렇다는데 진짠가?? -누가 캐스팅됐든 강우진이 메인이면 믿고본다!!! -송피디가 작품에 무명, 신인 대거 기용한 게 아마 진심으로 해외를 노려서 그런거 일 듯~ 인기보다는 연기나 배우 마스크를 봤겠짘ㅋㅋㅋ -↑하긴ㅋㅋㅋ차피 우리나라 탑배우 해봐야 국내용이니깤ㅋㅋㅋ외국애들한텐 거기서 거기지 -그래도 배우진들 이정도면 화려한 거지 -....아 뭔가 기대되기 시작했어....작은 게 아니라 큰 게 올 것같은데.... -강우진ㅋㅋㅋㅋ얘는 이제 찐으로 티켓파워 졸라 쎈 배우로 자리매김한듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅅㅂ하는 거마다 잘됔ㅋㅋㅋ이번 실종섬도 그렇고 -믿보배!! 강우진!!! -뭔 내용일지 가늠이 안 되네? 강우진 이번에는 무슨 역할 할까? · · · 여론의 반응은 생각보다 나쁘지 않았다. 그렇게 한참을 ‘이로운 악’ 관련을 보던 우진의 손가락이 다시 움직였다. -스윽. 이번에는 검색의 주제를 바꾼 것. ‘실종의 섬’이었다. [대한민국 역대 박스오피스] [역대 영화 순위(통합)] -1. 실종의 섬/ 누적관객수: 18,872,537명 개봉의 후반기. 초반에 비해 극명하게 힘이 빠진 데다 예매율도 밑으로 하락했으나, 현재 ‘실종의 섬’은 이미 국내서 유례없던 기록을 세웠다. 1900만에 가까운 수치. 물론, 이 상태로 정체가 되거나 조금 더 높아지는 게 전부일 가능성이 높지만 그런 건 이미 상관없었다. 실제 ‘실종의 섬’ 측은 슬슬 2차 유통을 준비 중이기도 했다. 뭐가 됐든 ‘실종의 섬’은 한국영화계에 판도를 뒤집었고. 『[스타이슈]데뷔부터 지금까지, 2년 안에 훈장만 수두룩한 ‘강우진’···국내 배우판에 유일무이한 업적들 남겨』 강우진은 국내 배우판의 역사를 정립했다. 다음 날, 25일. 진주. 시간은 정오를 넘겼다. 이쯤 진주 버스터미널 근방에 위치한, 최근 옆의 빈 가게까지 흡수해 두 배는 넓어진 죽집엔 손님이 가득했다. 강우진의 부모인 서현미, 강우철의 가게였다. “헐- 여기야? 사람 개많아.” “미, 미친. 죽집인데 줄 선거 실환가? 웨이팅도 있는 거야?!” “맛집보단- 역시 강우진 버프겠지??” “당연하지, 근데 저 죽집 자체가 이벤트가 많던데? 막 점심엔 공짜로 퍼주고, 주변 유치원이나 결식아동? 애들한테도 그냥 주기도 하고.” “강우진 부모님 대박 멋있네?” 밖에까지 손님이 몰린 죽집을 꽤 멀리서 보며 대화하는 두 여자처럼, 강우진 부모의 죽집은 이미 이 근방. 아니, 진주 전체의 관광명소처럼 굳어졌다. 진주에 사는 사람들이나 멀리서 오는 사람들에겐 필수 코스기도 했다. 인스타 핫플은 덤. “저 사람 봐봐, 핸드폰으로 뭐 찍는다. 너튜번가?” 당연하겠지만, 조회수를 위한 너튜버나 인터넷 방송하는 스트리머도 자주 출몰했다. 그뿐인가? 기자들도 뻔질나게 나타났다. “죽은 못 먹겠는데??” “아! 저기저기! 강우진 등신대 있는 곳이 그그 인스타에서 본 곳이다! 사진 찍는 곳!” “그럼 우린 걍 사진만 찍고 갈까?” 사람이 100명쯤 오면 사진만 찍고 가는 게 반이지만, 남은 반은 줄을 서서라도 죽집에 입장한다. 뭐 대부분이 호기심이겠지만 팬심이 그득한 손님들도 많았다. 또는 이 근방의 각종 협회나 상인회 또는 공무원들도 자주 들렀다. 그야말로 명소였다. 덕분에 지금 죽집에 줄 선 손님들의 입에선 당연하게도 강우진의 이름이 뱉어졌다. “기사 봤지? 강우진 그거 뭐냐 ‘이로운 악’ 캐스팅 발표된 거.” “당연하지- 나 완전 기대 중.” “하······근데 오늘도 강우진 못 보겠지? 벌써 두 달째 오는데 한 번도 못 봤잖아.” “포기하라니까? 솔까 난 이제 여기 맛있어서 오는데. 죽 먹으면 속이 편하기도 하고.” “그래도 나름 가능성 있다고 생각했는데- 뭐, 근데 여기 도시락이 맛있긴 해.” 줄 선 손님을 지나 죽집 내부를 보니 강우진 천국이었다. 그리고 역시나 모든 테이블은 만석이었다. 전보다 규모가 두 배나 늘었음에도 숨 쉴 틈이 없다. 확장을 시켜준 건 물론 강우진이었다. 어쨌든 손님들 테이블을 보니 죽 말고도 도시락 메뉴가 추가된 듯 보였고, 홀 사이사이를 휘젓는 유니폼 입은 아르바이트도 4명이나 있었다. 서현미, 강우철은 각각 주방과 카운터에서 찾을 수 있었다. “현미야- 계산!” “어어, 잠깐만! 여보 저기 테이블들 좀 치워줘!” “그래그래!” 둘 역시 눈코 뜰 새 없이 바쁘다. 주방에 일하는 직원이 있는데도 그렇다. 아들이 잘 됐으니 조금 쉴 만도 하건만, 둘은 우진의 제의를 한사코 거절했다. 아직 짱짱하다는 것이 이유였다. 어쨌든. “여기 테이블 4명 불러줘!” “예, 사장님!” 바삐 테이블을 치우는 강우철이 아르바이트에게 대기하는 손님을 콜했고, 와중에 옆옆에 앉은 중년 여자들이 그에게 뜬금 말을 걸었다. “어유- 사장님. 진주에 있는 돈 다 쓸어 담네, 담아.” 근방 시장의 아줌마들이었다. “내 말이. 아주 자식 농사를 제대로 지으셔가지고 말이야. 아니, 아들이 이렇게나 유명해질지 누가 알았겠어?” “부럽다, 부러워. 우리 집 짐승은 밥이나 축내고 운동도 안 하고 그러는데.” “여튼 여기 손님들 반만 시장에 가도 시끌시끌할 텐데.” “근데 사장님, 아들은 여기 안 와요? 본 적이 없네.” 키가 꽤 큰 강우철이 애써 웃으며 답했다. “제가 오지 말라고 합니다. 바쁜데 여까지 와서 뭐합니까.” “에이, 오면 얼마나 좋아? 부모 기도 살려주고.” “하하, 한국에서 제일 바쁘잖습니까.” “그래도 자식이 잘 됐으면 한 번은 얼굴을 비추고 그래야지.” “맞아맞아, 저기- 상만이네 아들이 트로트 가수라잖아? 그 아들은 심심하면 보러오고 그런다드만.” 강우철에게 쉴 새 없이 말을 거는 아줌마들. 사실, 성격이 없지 않은 강우철이었지만 참았다. 자신들의 행동이 아들의 얼굴임을 모르지 않았으니까. 보는 눈도 많고. 이때 카운터에 있던 서현미가 강우철에게 붙어 속삭였다. “빠져빠져, 저 아줌마들 안 받을 수도 없고 귀찮아 죽겠네.” 하지만 아줌마들은 서현미에게도 말을 걸었고. “어휴 여튼 아들 잘돼서 좋겠어요- 부러워 죽겠네.” 강우철과 서현미는 억지웃음을 보였다. 이때였다, 밖이 뭔가 소란스럽다. 그리곤. -스윽. 죽집의 입구 유리문이 열리며 웬 남자가 들어왔다. 모자를 푹 눌러 썼고 마스크를 썼다. 이어 그를 확인한 아르바이트 한 명이 난감한 듯 또는 의심 섞인 눈으로 말했다. “어? 어- 죄송한데 밖에서 줄을 서주셔야 하는데요!” 남자는 홀을 잠시 훑다가 아르바이트에게 말했다. 톤이 낮다. “전 괜찮습니다, 뭐 안 먹을 거라.” “······네? 그게 무슨.” 이 순간. “아!!!” 주방으로 들어가던 서현미가 마스크 쓴 남자를 검지로 찍으며 놀랐다. “어- 어?!!” 뒤이어 강우철도 그녀의 시선을 따른다. 아니, 넓어진 죽집에 있는 손님 모두가 남자를 힐끔 하거나 쳐다봤다. 그러거나 말거나. -슥. 마스크를 벗은 남자는 강우철과 서현미에게 작게 고개를 숙였다. “다녀왔습니다.” 곧, 죽집에 있는 모든 이의 눈이 디립다 커졌다. 이후 약 1시간 뒤, 진주시청. 시장실. 태극기는 물론, 집무용 책상이나 회의용 테이블이 비치된 진주시청의 시장실. 그런 시장실 집무 책상에 머리가 살짝 벗겨진 시장이 서류를 검토하고 있다. 바로 그때. -똑똑, 덜컥! 시장실에 문이 열리며 직원 한 명이 들어왔다. 직원은 시장 앞에 도착하자마자 다급히 보고했다. “시, 시장님! 지금 강우진이 진주에 왔다고 합니다!” 금세 시장의 눈알이 튀어나올 듯 커졌다. “뭐, 뭣이?!” < 숨통 (1) > 끝","output":"< Breath (1) > At night, the aged voice of director An Gabok echoed through the 'Leech' set via the loudspeaker. \\"Cut, OK.\\" Simultaneously, about a hundred staff members surrounding the set burst into vigorous applause. -Clap clap clap clap clap! -Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap! And most of them shouted with a sense of relief. \\"Finally!!\\" \\"Ah!! It's over!!\\" \\"You all worked really hard!\\" \\"Thank you for your hard work! Thank you!!\\" \\"You've been through a lot!!\\" Thanks to the shouts of about a hundred staff members, the sound filled the entire set. Of course, actors like Sim Hanho and Oh Heeryung, who were waiting, also joined in the cheering with smiles. Kang Woojin and Jin Jaejoon, who were inside the set, did the same. They all bowed their heads frantically, and their images were captured by the press. Naturally, the making-of team was also busy. The faces of the staff members, who were jumping around or dancing with joy, were filled with ecstasy, thrills, happiness, and emotion. It was a moment that could be fully understood. All filming for 'Leech' had just ended. While watching the half-mad staff, director An Gabok, sitting in front of the monitor, leaned back in his chair and let out a long sigh. \\"We've overcome a big hurdle now.\\" At that moment. \\"Director.\\" Kang Woojin, who had made his way through the excited staff, greeted director An Gabok. Naturally, his poker face was thick. \\"I've worked hard, and I need to leave first, so I wanted to say goodbye.\\" Woojin had one more schedule related to 'Kang Woojin's alternate character'. Soon, director An Gabok extended his wrinkled hand to Kang Woojin. \\"It's not over yet, but yes. Woojin, you've worked hard too. And.\\" Director An Gabok raised his other hand and showed a thumbs up. \\"The last scene was breathtaking.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" \\"It's a shame. There's a dinner party later, and you could have rested a bit.\\" After a brief conversation with director An Gabok, Kang Woojin said his final goodbyes to the actors. Then, only Woojin and his team began to leave the 'Leech' set. Watching Kang Woojin's retreating figure was the great actor Sim Hanho. \\"......\\" He was clearly recalling the last scene that Woojin had been in. 'Is he so relaxed that he's thinking beyond script analysis to directing? He's becoming more and more frightening.' At that moment, a female voice reached Sim Hanho's ears. It was Oh Heeryung, with her elegant smile. \\"What are you looking at so intently? Are you lost in thought, senior?\\" \\"Hm? Ah. No.\\" Following Sim Hanho's gaze, Oh Heeryung spotted the departing Kang Woojin. Crossing her arms with a knowing look, she said. \\"The last cut was really chilling, wasn't it? What did you think, senior?\\" \\"......It was brilliant. Even I, an old man, didn't think of it.\\" \\"Don't say that. You have your own thing, your own charisma. It's just different.\\" \\"It wouldn't be strange to say it's on a different level.\\" \\"What? Senior, that's not like you.\\" \\"I'm just saying that Korea is too small for that guy.\\" After a response like \\"Aha-\\", Oh Heeryung once again looked towards the departing Kang Woojin. \\"Anyway, Woojin's last scene was really- how should I put it, it was like 'Park Hasung' from the work came to life and was running around in reality.\\" She chuckled. \\"When a character comes to life, it has to be on a different level.\\" Some tens of minutes later, Kang Woojin's van. Kang Woojin's van was speeding down the highway, having left the set about 30 minutes ago. -Vroom! As the large van roared and sped along, the inside was bustling. Of course, Woojin's team members were setting off firecrackers in celebration. Meanwhile, the main character, Kang Woojin. \\"......\\" Kang Woojin didn't open his mouth. He wanted to join in right away, but he just looked at his phone with a firm concept in mind. Of course, the internet that Kang Woojin was looking at showed no sign of leisure for even a moment. \\"Wow- it's crazy over here too, crazy.\\" Several articles were being bombarded. Naturally, the news related to Kang Woojin was the most visible. \\"[Issue Pick] Official casting announced for 'Beneficial Evil', but why so many unknowns and newcomers?\\" First, this morning's official actor casting for 'Beneficial Evil' had become a flood of issues over time. Of course, the first source was Netflix and DM Productions of 'Beneficial Evil', but now reporters who picked up the thrown bait were frantically copy-pasting similar articles. \\"Kang Woojin, who made history in the film industry, has high expectations for 'Beneficial Evil', but the casting raises eyebrows.\\" 'Beneficial Evil' had attracted attention with big names like producer Song Manwoo and Kang Woojin at the official production announcement, and its recognition soared with the issue of targeting the whole world through Netflix, not a domestic broadcaster. Therefore, the media's fervor was not surprising. The media's biggest question about this confirmed casting board for 'Beneficial Evil' was, as expected, the large number of unknown and newcomer actors. Although it had not yet been revealed which roles the cast actors, from leads to supporting and minor roles, would play, their number was significantly higher compared to ordinary projects. Thus, many speculations overflowed. Are they giving up on the domestic market to target the world? Did they lack funds because they invested more in sets and direction? Or are they trying to achieve another challenge? 'Beneficial Evil' was a pre-produced work, after all. Information was scarce. Pre-production usually has plenty of bait but is often classified. Soon, Kang Woojin skimmed through numerous articles and muttered to himself. 'All kinds of nonsense and bullshit. If we're aiming for overseas, isn't it utter nonsense to say we're saving money by hiring unknowns??' It was absurd, but he wasn't too annoyed. Woojin had become accustomed to such sights. Well, that didn't mean there were no high-impact tops at all. Hwarin, who had a deep connection with Kang Woojin, and Ha Gangsu, who had worked together on 'Our Dining Table', were among the actors positioned from tops to A-list and above for each upcoming episode. But the casting board was undoubtedly contrary to the media's expectations. After producing numerous hits, and most recently leaving a legend with 'Profiler Hanryang', they would have thought that producer Song Manwoo would have a line of tops. Plus, hadn't they said they were targeting the whole world? Given the conditions and big names, the current situation with many unknowns and newcomers might seem a bit lukewarm. This was not only the media but also various YouTubers who sniffed out the issue and moved similarly. Woojin checked the public's reaction with an indifferent face. -'Beneficial Evil' has cast a lot of newcomersㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ The articles say it's because they don't have money, is that true?? -No matter who's cast, if Kang Woojin is the main, I trust and watch!!! -Song PD probably cast a lot of unknowns and newcomers for 'Beneficial Evil' because he's seriously aiming for overseas~ He's looking at acting and actor's visuals rather than popularityㅋㅋㅋ -↑Trueㅋㅋㅋ Our country's top actors are just for domestic use anywayㅋㅋㅋ To foreigners, they're all the same -But with these actors, it's still a glamorous cast -....I'm starting to get excited.... It feels like something big is coming, not something small.... -Kang Woojinㅋㅋㅋㅋ This guy has really established himself as a powerful ticket-selling actorㅋㅋㅋ Everything he does goes wellㅋㅋㅋ Including this recent 'The Island of the Missing' -Trustworthy actor!! Kang Woojin!!! -What's the content going to be? What role will Kang Woojin play this time? · · · The public's reaction was not as bad as expected. After looking at 'Beneficial Evil' related content for a while, Woojin's fingers moved again. -Swish. This time, he changed the search topic. It was 'The Island of the Missing'. [South Korea's All-Time Box Office] [All-Time Movie Rankings (Integrated)] -1. The Island of the Missing / Cumulative Audience: 18,872,537 In the latter half of its release. Although it had lost much of its initial momentum and the reservation rate had dropped, 'The Island of the Missing' had already set an unprecedented record in Korea. A figure close to 19 million. Of course, it was likely that this would be the peak or it might rise a bit more, but that was already irrelevant. In fact, the team behind 'The Island of the Missing' was already preparing for secondary distribution. Whatever the case, 'The Island of the Missing' had overturned the landscape of the Korean film industry. \\"[Star Issue] From debut to now, in less than 2 years, 'Kang Woojin' has left unique achievements in the domestic acting scene...\\" Kang Woojin had established the history of the domestic acting scene. The next day, the 25th. Jinju. The time had passed noon. Around this time, near the Jinju Bus Terminal, a porridge shop that had recently expanded to double its size by absorbing the empty store next door was full of customers. It was the shop of Kang Woojin's parents, Seo Hyunmi and Kang Woocheol. \\"Wow- is this the place? It's packed with people.\\" \\"Mi, crazy. It's a porridge shop, but is this for real? Is there a waiting line?!\\" \\"It's more than just a famous spot- it must be the Kang Woojin buff, right??\\" \\"Of course, but this porridge shop itself has a lot of events, right? Like giving away free porridge at lunch, and also giving it to nearby kindergartens or children with meal insecurity.\\" \\"Kang Woojin's parents are so cool, aren't they?\\" As the two women conversed from a distance, looking at the porridge shop crowded with customers even outside, Kang Woojin's parents' porridge shop had already become a tourist attraction in the area. No, it had become a must-visit spot for the entire city of Jinju. It was a mandatory course for both locals and visitors from afar. Being an Instagram hotspot was a bonus. \\"Look at that person, filming something with their phone. A YouTuber?\\" Naturally, YouTubers seeking views and streamers broadcasting on the internet also frequently appeared. And so did reporters. \\"Can't we eat the porridge??\\" \\"Ah! There there! That's the place with Kang Woojin's life-size standee that I saw on Instagram! The photo spot!\\" \\"Should we just take photos and leave?\\" If 100 people come, about half just take photos and leave, but the other half waits in line to enter the porridge shop. Most are probably out of curiosity, but there were also many customers brimming with fan love. Various associations, merchant associations, and government officials from the area also frequented the place. It was truly a landmark. As a result, the name Kang Woojin naturally spilled from the mouths of the customers lined up outside the porridge shop. \\"Did you see the article? Kang Woojin, that 'Beneficial Evil' casting announcement.\\" \\"Of course- I'm really looking forward to it.\\" \\"Ha... But we won't see Kang Woojin today, right? It's been two months since I've been coming here and I haven't seen him once.\\" \\"Give up, will you? Honestly, I come here now because it's delicious. The porridge is comforting.\\" \\"Still, I thought there was a chance- Well, but the lunch boxes here are tasty.\\" Passing by the lined-up customers and looking inside the porridge shop, it was a Kang Woojin heaven. And, as expected, every table was full. Despite being twice the size as before, there was no room to breathe. The expansion was, of course, thanks to Kang Woojin. Looking at the customers' tables, it seemed that lunch box menus had been added in addition to porridge, and there were four uniformed part-timers bustling between the tables. Seo Hyunmi and Kang Woocheol could be found in the kitchen and at the counter, respectively. \\"Hyunmi-ya, the bill!\\" \\"Uh, wait a minute! Honey, please clear those tables!\\" \\"Okay, okay!\\" Both were too busy to even catch their breath, despite having staff working in the kitchen. Their son was doing well, so they could have taken a break, but they firmly refused Woojin's offer. They claimed they were still strong and healthy. Anyway. \\"Table for four, please!\\" \\"Yes, boss!\\" As Kang Woocheol busily cleared tables, he called over waiting customers, and in the meantime, middle-aged women sitting nearby started a conversation with him out of the blue. \\"Wow, boss. You're going to sweep all the money in Jinju.\\" They were market ladies from the neighborhood. \\"I'm telling you. You've really raised your child well. Who would have known your son would become so famous?\\" \\"I'm so jealous. My house's beast just eats and doesn't exercise.\\" \\"Anyway, if even half of these customers went to the market, it would be bustling.\\" \\"But boss, doesn't your son come here? I've never seen him.\\" The quite tall Kang Woocheol tried to smile and answered. \\"I told him not to come. He's busy, why would he come all the way here?\\" \\"Ah, it would be so nice if he came. It would revive the parents' spirits.\\" \\"Ha ha, he's the busiest in Korea, isn't he?\\" \\"Still, if your child is doing well, he should show his face at least once.\\" \\"That's right, that's right. Look- Sangmani's son is a trot singer, right? That son comes to watch whenever he's bored.\\" The ladies kept talking to Kang Woocheol non-stop. In fact, Kang Woocheol had a personality, but he endured it. He knew that their behavior reflected on his son. There were many watching eyes. At that moment, Seo Hyunmi, who was at the counter, leaned in and whispered to Kang Woocheol. \\"Get out of there, those ladies are unbearable and we can't refuse them.\\" However, the ladies also spoke to Seo Hyunmi. \\"Anyway, it's great that your son is doing well- I'm so jealous.\\" Kang Woocheol and Seo Hyunmi forced a smile. It was then that something seemed to cause a commotion outside. And then. -Swish. The entrance door of the porridge shop opened, and a man entered. He wore a hat pulled down low and a mask. Then, one of the part-timers, looking perplexed or suspicious, said. \\"Uh? Uh- sorry, but you need to wait in line outside!\\" The man glanced around the hall for a moment and then said to the part-timer. His tone was low. \\"I'm fine, I won't eat anything.\\" \\"......What? What do you mean?\\" At that moment. \\"Ah!!!\\" Seo Hyunmi, who was heading to the kitchen, pointed at the masked man and exclaimed in surprise. \\"Wh- What?!!\\" Following her gaze, Kang Woocheol and everyone else in the expanded porridge shop glanced or stared at the man. Regardless. -Swish. The man who took off his mask bowed slightly to Kang Woocheol and Seo Hyunmi. \\"I'm back.\\" Soon, everyone's eyes in the porridge shop widened in disbelief. About an hour later, at Jinju City Hall. The Mayor's Office. In the Mayor's Office of Jinju City Hall, furnished with the national flag, an executive desk, and a conference table, the slightly balding mayor was reviewing documents. Just then. -Knock knock, bang! The door to the Mayor's Office opened, and an employee entered. As soon as the employee reached the mayor, he urgently reported. \\"Ma-Mayor! Kang Woojin has come to Jinju!\\" The mayor's eyes nearly popped out of his head. \\"What, what?!\\" < Breath (1) > End"},{"instruction":"< 숨통 (5) > 강우진은 사실 아동 센터에 올 필요는 없었다. 애초 진주에는 휴식을 위해 왔었던 거였고, 예정에도 없던 스케줄을 행하면 여러모로 일이 커진다. 진주 시장이든 누구든 괜히 사람들의 눈에 띄면 잡소리가 나올 가능성도 있고. 하지만 우진은 아동 센터에 왔다. ‘오- 생각보다 크네.’ 좋은 일을 한다는 의미도 있겠지만, 여동생인 강현아와 팬클럽 ‘강심장’이 마음에 걸려서였다. 뭐 어차피 휴식의 마지막 날인데 살짝만 얼굴을 비추고 빠질 셈이었다. 처음 그의 기분은 그다지 나쁘지 않았었다. 아동 센터에 도착하자마자 보인 자신의 여동생 때문이었다. ‘저기 있네. 크크, 뭐여 겁나 어색해.’ 홀의 입구 복도 쪽에서 발견한 강현아. ‘강심장’ 운영진들과 모여 얘기를 나누는 모습이 웃겼기 때문이었다. 이미 컨셉질이 짙은 우진은 저도 모르게 웃음이 터질뻔했다. 대체 왜 저렇게 진지한 거냐. 이미 강현아 인생 전반적인 것을 아는 강우진. 즉, 오빠였기에 여동생의 지금 모습은 개그 그 자체였다. 이쯤 강우진은 강현아를 놀릴 생각으로 가득했었다. 허나 참았다. ‘그래도 강심장 회장님이시니까.’ 쟤도 사회적 위치가 있지. 나름 회장님이시지 않은가? 뭣보다 강현아에게 평소처럼 하면 우진의 현 포커페이스가 깨진다. 따라서 우진은 열 걸음 정도 떨어진 복도의 강현아를 보면서도 일단 걸음을 멈췄다. 여동생이 빠지면 홀에 들어갈 작정이었다. 다만, 이 마음은. “거- 참 너무하는구만.” 돌연 홀에서 나타난 웬 중년 남자 때문에 깨졌다. 술이라도 마셨나? 물론, 강우진의 시선에서나 그랬다. 술톤의 얼굴에 통통한 60대 남자. 그가 돌연 강현아에게 시비를 털기 시작했고, 약간 멀리서 이를 지켜보던 강우진의 미간이 구겨졌다. 컨셉질이 아니었다. 진심이었다. 그래도 일단은 잠시 지켜봤다. 그럴 필요가 없었다. 술톤의 남자는. 아니, 본인은 이 아동 센터의 후원사 대표라 말한 놈은 강현아와 대화할수록 선을 넘고 있었다. 뭐지 저 미친놈은? 이쯤 우진의 심정은 분노에 가까웠다. 빡침이 올라왔다. ‘걔는 나만 팰 수 있다고.’ 그런 말이 있다. 오빠란 존재는 집에선 여동생을 갈군다지만 타인이 혈육을 털면 못 참는다는. 지금의 강우진이 딱 그랬다. 우진의 ‘노빠꾸’ 기질이 점화됐다. 아공간을 가지기 전인 강우진은 원래도 성격이 호락호락하진 않았었다. 뭐, 건들지만 않는다면 별일 없겠지만 괜히 터치하면 참지는 않았다. 직진. 타이밍은 후원사 대표가 마무리 멘트를 던졌을 때였다. “꼭 그 강우진에게 전달하라고. 내년엔 고작 천만 말고 좀 더 하고.” “직접 말씀하시면 되겠네요.” 강우진은 거침없이 여동생과 후원사 대표가 선 자리로 성큼성큼 걸었고, 그들에게 당도하자마자 술톤의 남자를 내려봤다. 우진은 짜증이 가득했지만, 최대한 감정을 숨겼다. 그럼에도 그의 눈은 서늘했다. 급작스레 나타난 우진 때문에 후원사 대표는 명백히 당황했다. 내 알 바인가? “1억.” 강우진이 1억이란 어마어마한 돈을 쉽게 쾌척했다. 뿐만이 아니었다. 이 아동 센터의 후원사 역시 자리에서 교체해버린다. 일이 묘하게 흘러갔다. 기분이야 나빴겠지만 강현아는 오빠가 이렇게까지 할 줄은 몰랐는지, 우진과 후원사 대표를 번갈아 보며 당황했고 ‘강심장’ 운영진들도 같은 얼굴이었다. 술톤의 후원사 대표는 작게 입을 벌리긴 했지만 목소리가 나오지 않는 모양이었다. 그저 무심한 얼굴의 강우진을 올려볼 뿐. 반대로 강우진은. “예, 대표님. 감사합니다.” 핸드폰을 귀에 붙인 채 통화 상대인 최성건에게 감사를 표했다. 현 상태의 설명은 하지 않았다. 그럼에도 최성건은 별수롭지 않았다. “그쪽 아동 센터? 어, 거기랑 연결해줘라.” “알겠습니다.” “나머진 내가 알아서 할거고. 설명해줄 시간은 있냐?” “나중에 다시 전화하겠습니다.” “그래. 잘 정리하고.” 몇억이 오가는 통화가 단 몇 십 초 만에 끊겼다. 억이라는 금액이 불렸으나 최성건은 우진에게 이렇다 한 이유를 묻지 않았다. 평소의 강우진을 잘 알고 있기 때문이었다. 그가 움직였다면 필시 이유가 있겠지 싶은 거겠지. 뭐가 됐든. -스윽. 핸드폰을 내린 우진이 앞에서 사고가 멈춘 후원사 대표를 보며 낮게 말했다. “방금 이 아동 센터의 후원사도 바뀌었습니다.” “···이, 이봐.” “아직도 반말을 하시네요.” “그게 아니고.” “사과부터 하세요.” 우진이 차분하게 왼쪽에 선 강현아를 가리켰다. “저야 반말을 늘상 듣는 직업이니 상관없지만, 여기 계신 분은 제 팬클럽의 회장님이십니다.” “······” “당신에게 반말을 들은 사람이 아닙니다.” 차가운 음성. 강우진의 포스터 넘친다. 이에 강현아는 사이다를 들이켠 것 같으면서도 의아했다. 평소 자신 오빠의 캐릭터와는 전혀 달랐으니까. 예전에도 이런 생각을 가진 적이 있었던 거 같은데? 하지만 상황이 상황이니만큼 그녀는 일단 입을 다물었다. 다시금 강우진의 딱딱한 목소리가 퍼졌다. “사과하세요.” 곧, 원래도 술톤이나 더 붉어진 얼굴의 후원사 대표는 눈치를 살폈다. ‘망할.’ 적당히 저 팬클럽 애들에게 쿠사리나 주고 가려던 참이었다. 그런데 급작스레 강우진이 등장할 줄이야. 허나 대충 얼버무리기엔 판이 너무 커졌다. 뭣보다 사과하기엔 후원사 대표의 자존심이 허락지 않았다. 따라서 그는. “큼!” 강우진과는 결 다른 쎈척을 시전했다. “내, 내가 틀린 소릴 한 건 아니잖은가.” 이때였다. “무슨 일이지?” 홀 쪽에서 늙은 남자 음성이 끼었다. 돌아보니 머리가 벗겨진 진주 시장이 서 있었다. 그 주변으로는 지역 유지들이나 아동 센터 직원들도 보였다. 이에 후원사 대표가 티 나게 당황했다. “···아, 아닙니다! 그저 잠시 얘기를. 그렇지! 여기 강우진씨가 오셔서!” 후원사 대표의 자존심이 진주 시장 앞에서는 금방 수그러들었다. 그러거나 말거나 진주 시장은. “흠.” 근엄한 강우진을 힐끔 하면서도 사태를 파악했다. 그리곤 술톤의 후원사 대표로 시선을 돌렸다. ‘이 양반이 또 뭔 짓을 했구만.’ 평소에도 후원사 대표는 잡음이 좀 많은 인물인 듯 보였다. 어쨌든 진주 시장은 고개를 돌려 아동 센터 직원들에게 말했다. “문을 좀 닫지.” “예? 아- 예!” 진주 시장의 지시로 홀의 입구 문이 닫혔다. 즉, 구경꾼들의 시선이 차단됐고, 진주 시장은 강우진과 강현아가 선 쪽으로 직진했다. 와중 후원사 대표가 끼어들긴 했으나. “저기 시장님!” 한 손을 올린 진주 시장이 그의 말을 막았다. 대신에 그는 우진과 강현아에게 물었다. “반갑습니다, 강우진씨. 그 전에 무슨 일인지 들어볼 수 있습니까?” 우진은 침묵했다. 설명을 시작한 것은 강현아였다. 자신이 당한 것을 전부 말했다. 듣는 도중 진주 시장은 한숨을 몇 번이나 쉬었다. 이윽고. “후-” 설명을 다 들은 진주 시장은 벗겨진 머리를 쓸면서도 옆에 붙은 후원사 대표를 바라봤다. “박대표님.” “···예, 예. 시장님.” 진주 시장의 목소리는 나긋나긋했지만 결코 가볍지는 않았다. “내가 이전에도 몇 번이나 말씀드렸잖아요, 괜한 분란 일으키지 마시라고. 왜 자꾸 그러시는지 모르겠네.” “······” “이젠 나도 참기가 힘들겠어요. 일단, 여기 ‘강심장’ 분들한테 사과부터 하세요.” 눈치를 살피던 후원사 대표가 헛기침하면서도 작게 고개를 숙였다. “그- 내가 미안하네.” “또 반말.” “아! 아닙니다, 시장님. 제가 미안합니다.” “후우, 그리고 오늘부로 후원사 대표는 그만두는 거로 합시다.” “예, 시장님. 아! 예?!” “아동 센터 후원사의 대표쯤 되시는 분이 이렇게 잡음이 많으면 쓰겠습니까?” “···아, 아니 그게.” “일 더 키우지 마시고 그렇게 합시다.” “······” 어버버 대는 후원사 대표가. 아니, 대표였던 남자가 사색이 됐다. 허나 진주 시장은 아랑곳없이 무던한 우진을 보며 다시 말했고. “고향에 쉬러 오셨는데 불편을 드린 것 같습니다. 시장으로서 사과드립니다.” 톤이 일정한 강우진이 답했다. “괜찮습니다.” “그보다 굳이 이 아동 센터의 후원사를 맡아주실 건 없어요, 일의 정리는 내가 알아서 해도 되니까. 이미 ‘강심장’분들이 기부해주시기도 했고.” “아니요, 제가 기부한다는 거나 후원사를 맡는다는 것은 진심이었습니다.” 우진이 대수롭지 않게 답했다. “앞으론 제가 맡겠습니다.” 이후. 진주 시장의 정리로 아동 센터는 다시금 평화가 찾아왔다. 일단, 술톤의 대표는 진주 시장이나 강우진 등에게 몇 번의 사과를 한 뒤에 자리를 빠져나갔다. 초반의 기세는 사라진 모습이었다. 그야말로 터덜터덜 패잔병의 모습. 아마 진주 시장에게 밉보여선 좋을 게 없다는 거겠지. 뒤로 진주 시장은 다시금 홀로 돌아갔고, ‘강심장’의 운영진들과 강우진은 몇 마디 대화를 나눴다. “오늘 고생 많으셨습니다. 제가 좀 빨리 왔어야 했네요.” “···아, 아니요! 그보다 오빠! 아니, 우진님! 악수 한 번 해주실 수 있나요??!” “저도!” 팬클럽에서 왕성하게 활동하며 우진을 실물로도 봤던 그녀들이었지만, 이렇게나 가까이서 강우진을 본 건 처음이었다. 약간 진정한 우진은. ‘후- 일단 진정하고.’ 컨셉질을 장착하면서도 목소리를 조금 부드럽게 만들었다. “물론이죠.” 악수가 아닌 포옹을 해주는 그. 핸드폰 케이스나 종이에 사인까지 마쳤다. 그녀들은 방방 뛰며 아동 센터를 벗어났고, 강현아는 아까부터 오빠의 얼굴을 가만- 히 바라보고 있었다. “오빠.” 강우진은 주변을 살피며 목소리를 죽였다. “야, 너 일단 집에 가.” “아니 오빠.” “가라고. 여긴 알아서 정리할 테니까. 말 들어, 용돈 끊기 전에.” 급작스레 90도로 꾸벅 인사하는 강현아. “고생하십쇼, 오빠님!” 후다닥 뛰어가는 강현아의 뒷모습을 보던 우진이 작게 한숨을 뱉은 후, 자신을 기다리는 사람이 넘치는 홀의 안으로 진입했다. 예상대로. “어이구!! 강우진씨! 처음 뵙겠습니다.” “허허, 역시나 아주 훤칠하시구먼?? 오늘부터 아동 센터 후원사를 맡아주신다고요?” “심지어 기부도 더 하신답니다!” 지역 유지나 아동 센터 직원들 등등, 오늘 행사에 참여한 모든 인원이 강우진에게 달라붙었다. 물론, 약간 자랑스런 얼굴로 변한 머리 벗겨진 진주 시장도 마찬가지였다. 여기서부터 강우진은 정신이 없었다. “어떻게, 우리 우진씨 사진을 좀 찍어주실 수 있습니까? 아아- 불편하면 안 해도 돼요.” “찍어도 괜찮습니다.” 기부 1억과 공식적인 아동 센터 후원사 대표로서의 스케줄을 소화해야 했으니까. 진주 시장과 또는 지역 유지들 등과 단체 사진을 몇 번이나 찍었다. 자리에 있는 진주 시청 너튜브 팀과의 인터뷰 요청도 있었으나 그건 우진이 거절했다. 결과적으로 우진이 이곳에 머문 시간은 얼추 1시간. 마지막으로 강우진과 대화를 나눈 것은 진주 시장이었다. 그의 표정이 초반과 달리 매우 밝다. “허허허, 강우진씨. 오늘 정말 감사합니다. 생각지도 못한 일들이 많았네요.” “아닙니다.” “어- 그런데 역시 홍보 대사 건은.” “힘들 것 같습니다. 스케줄 상.” “그렇습니까? 알겠습니다. 그럼 오늘 오신 건은 혹시 기사로 나가도 괜찮나요?” “네.” 시장과 대화를 마친 우진은 아동 센터 직원들에게 간단히 말했다. “저희 회사랑 연결해드릴게요.” 후원사 교체를 위함이었다. 이어 적당히 마무리 인사를 마친 강우진이 홀을 빠져나갔다. 특이한 것은. “······” “······” 홀에 잠시간 침묵이 퍼진다는 것. 그러다 몇 초 뒤 괴성 비슷한 것이 동시에 폭발했다. “와!!! 강우진 진심 실물 미쳤어요!!” “아니, 사람이 처음엔 좀 냉해 보이더니 엄청 매너 있잖아??!” “포스가 진짜······완전 미쳤어.” “배우는 진짜 배우네. 확실히 일반적인 아우라는 아니었죠?!” 이쯤 강우진은 외부 주차장에 세워진 애마에 탄 상태였고. “하- 일이 좀 커졌네.” 대강 혀를 차며 시동을 걸었다. 행선지는 당연하겠지만 집이었다. 집에 도착하니 강현아가 득달같이 달려들었으나 강우진의 압승이었다. 이날 밤, 강우진과 강현아 그리고 우진의 부모가 모여 저녁 식사를 함께했다. 오늘은 강우진의 마지막 휴일이니까. “우진아, 이제 또 바빠지지?” “오빠! ‘이로운 악’ 정보 좀 줘! 팬카페에 올리게!” 시끌벅적한 저녁 식사였지만 강우진은 퍽 안정감을 느꼈다. ‘오랜만이네, 이런 거. 진짜 얼마 만이냐.’ 가족이 모두 모인 게 실로 간만이었으니까. 이런 시간도 나쁘진 않았다. 허나. ‘슬슬 좀 좀이 쑤시는 것도 있어.’ 편한 만큼 ‘배우 강우진’으로 돌아가고 싶은 마음도 컸다. 그새 워커홀릭이 된 건가? 명확한 답은 모르겠으나 식사를 마친 강우진은 강우철, 서현미에게 인사를 마친 뒤 누웠다. 그리곤. -푹! 챙겨온 대본에 붙은 검은 사각형을 찔렀다. 금방 우진의 시야는 온통 컴컴한 아공간이 펼쳐졌고. “보자-” 그는 배우 강우진을 끌어 올리기 시작했다. 28일 월요일, 정오쯤. 강우진이 진주에서 삼성동 오피스텔에 도착한 시각은 12시 10분쯤. 주차장에는 시간에 맞춰 익숙한 밴이 대기하고 있었다. 물론, 우진을 맞이할 밴이었고. “형님!!” 가장 먼저 덩치 좋은 장수환이 우진을 반겼다. 에너지가 평소보다 넘쳤다. 우진의 쉴 때 그의 팀들도 모두 휴가였으니까. 곧, 강우진은 밴을 타고 bw 엔터로 넘어갔다. bw 엔터는 그야말로 전쟁터였다. 이젠 스타트업이었던 모습을 찾기도 힘들다. 수십이던 직원들이 수백이 됐고 합류한 탑배우들도 많았으니까. 어쨌든 우진은 꽤 넓어진 대표실에 입성했다. 일에 파묻혔던 꽁지머리 최성건이 비죽 웃으며 다가왔다. “잘 쉬었냐?” 강우진은 간만에 제대로 된 컨셉질을 장착했다. “예, 대표님.” “진주 쪽 일이나 기사, 그리고 이것저것 전달할 게 많은데. 일단.” 이어 최성건이 자리서 투명파일 하나를 집어 우진에게 내밀었다. “‘이로운 악’ 1화, 2화 대본에 장면이 추가된다더라. 러닝타임이 늘어난다는 거지.” 즉, 대본에 변화가 생긴다는 뜻이었다. < 숨통 (5) > 끝","output":"< Breath (5) > Kang Woojin didn't actually need to visit the children's center. He had come to Jinju for a rest, and taking on an unplanned schedule could complicate matters in many ways. Whether it was the mayor of Jinju or anyone else, attracting people's attention could lead to unnecessary talk. But Woojin went to the children's center anyway. 'Oh- it's bigger than I thought.' It was partly because he wanted to do something meaningful, but also because he was concerned about his younger sister, Kang Hyunah, and his fan club 'Kang's Heart'. After all, it was the last day of his break, and he intended to make a brief appearance and leave. Initially, his mood wasn't too bad. It was because of his sister, whom he saw as soon as he arrived at the children's center. 'There she is. Keke, why does she look so awkward?' He spotted Kang Hyunah in the hallway at the entrance of the hall, talking with the 'Kang's Heart' management team, and he found it amusing. Woojin, already deep in his persona, almost burst out laughing without realizing it. Why is she so serious? Knowing everything about Kang Hyunah's life, Woojin, as her brother, found her current appearance to be a comedy in itself. At this point, Woojin was full of thoughts to tease his sister. However, he held back. 'After all, she's the president of Kang's Heart.' She has a social position, doesn't she? She's the president, after all. Besides, if he treated Kang Hyunah as usual, it would break Woojin's current poker face. Therefore, Woojin stopped walking about ten steps away from Kang Hyunah in the hallway, intending to enter the hall once his sister left. However, this intention was shattered. \\"Jeez- that's too much.\\" A middle-aged man suddenly appeared from the hall, seemingly drunk. Of course, that's how it seemed from Kang Woojin's perspective. The man, in his 60s with a flushed face, started to pick a fight with Kang Hyunah, and Woojin, watching from a distance, frowned. It wasn't an act. He was genuinely annoyed. Still, he watched for a moment. There was no need. The flushed man, who claimed to be a sponsor of the children's center, crossed the line more and more as he talked with Kang Hyunah. What's with this crazy guy? At this point, Woojin was close to anger. He was getting pissed off. 'She's only for me to scold.' There's a saying that brothers scold their sisters at home, but they can't stand it when someone else picks on their kin. That was exactly how Kang Woojin felt right now. Woojin's 'no-nonsense' temperament was ignited. Before acquiring the subspace, Woojin was not someone to be trifled with. Well, as long as no one bothered him, there wouldn't be any trouble, but he wouldn't hold back if provoked. Straightforward. The timing was when the sponsor representative threw his final remark. \\"Make sure to tell that Kang Woojin. Next year, aim for more than just ten million.\\" \\"You can tell him yourself.\\" Woojin strode confidently to where his sister and the sponsor representative were standing, and upon reaching them, he looked down at the flushed man. Woojin was annoyed but tried to hide his emotions as much as possible. Still, his eyes were cold. The sponsor representative was clearly flustered by Woojin's sudden appearance. What do I care? \\"I'll donate 100 million.\\" Kang Woojin easily pledged an enormous amount of money. Not only that, he also replaced the sponsor of the children's center on the spot. Things took an unexpected turn. Kang Hyunah was surprised that her brother went to such lengths, as she hadn't expected him to do so, and the 'Kang's Heart' management team had similar expressions. The flushed sponsor representative opened his mouth slightly but seemed unable to speak. He just looked up at the indifferent Kang Woojin. On the other hand, Kang Woojin. \\"Yes, President. Thank you.\\" He thanked Choi Seonggeon on the phone, who was on the other end of the call. Woojin didn't explain the current situation, but Choi Seonggeon wasn't bothered. \\"Connect me to that children's center.\\" \\"Understood.\\" \\"I'll take care of the rest. Do you have time to explain?\\" \\"I'll call you back later.\\" \\"Alright. Make sure everything is settled.\\" The conversation involving billions ended in just a few seconds. Choi Seonggeon didn't ask Woojin why he did it, knowing him well. If Woojin took action, there must be a reason. Whatever the case. -Swish. Woojin, who had put down his phone, spoke lowly to the sponsor representative who had stopped in front of him. \\"The sponsorship of this children's center has just changed.\\" \\"Look here.\\" \\"You're still speaking informally.\\" \\"That's not what I meant.\\" \\"Apologize first.\\" Woojin calmly pointed to Kang Hyunah standing to his left. \\"It doesn't matter to me since I'm used to being spoken to informally in my profession, but the person here is the president of my fan club.\\" \\"......\\" \\"She's not someone you should be speaking informally to.\\" His voice was cold. Kang Woojin's presence was overwhelming. Kang Hyunah felt like she had drunk a refreshing soda, yet she was puzzled. It was so different from her brother's usual character. Hadn't she had this thought before? But given the situation, she kept quiet for now. Kang Woojin's firm voice filled the air again. \\"Apologize.\\" Soon, the sponsor representative, already flushed from alcohol, now even redder, looked around hesitantly. 'Damn it.' He had intended to give those fan club kids a piece of his mind and leave. But Kang Woojin's sudden appearance was unexpected. However, the situation had grown too big to gloss over. Moreover, the sponsor representative's pride wouldn't allow him to apologize. So, he. \\"Cough!\\" He put on a tough act, different from Kang Woojin's. \\"I didn't say anything wrong.\\" That's when it happened. \\"What's going on here?\\" An elderly man's voice came from the hall. Turning around, the balding mayor of Jinju was standing there. Nearby were local dignitaries and children's center staff. The sponsor representative was visibly flustered. \\"···No, it's nothing! Just a little talk. That's right! Mr. Kang Woojin is here!\\" The sponsor representative's pride quickly deflated in front of the mayor of Jinju. Regardless, the mayor of Jinju. \\"Hmm.\\" He glanced at the stern Kang Woojin and assessed the situation. Then he turned his gaze to the flushed sponsor representative. 'This guy has caused trouble again.' The sponsor representative was known to be a bit troublesome. Anyway, the mayor of Jinju turned to the children's center staff and said. \\"Close the door.\\" \\"What? Ah- Yes!\\" At the mayor's command, the entrance door to the hall was closed, blocking the view of onlookers. The mayor then walked straight to where Kang Woojin and Kang Hyunah were standing, ignoring the sponsor representative who tried to intervene. \\"Mayor!\\" The mayor raised a hand to stop him and instead asked Woojin and Kang Hyunah. \\"Nice to meet you, Mr. Kang Woojin. Before that, may I hear what happened?\\" Woojin remained silent. Kang Hyunah began to explain, telling everything that had happened to her. During the explanation, the mayor of Jinju sighed several times. Afterward. \\"Phew.\\" Having heard the explanation, the mayor of Jinju, with his balding head, looked at the sponsor representative beside him. \\"Mr. Park.\\" \\"···Yes, yes. Mayor.\\" The mayor's voice was gentle but not light. \\"I've told you several times before not to cause unnecessary trouble. I don't understand why you keep doing this.\\" \\"······\\" \\"I can't put up with it anymore. First, apologize to the 'Kang's Heart' members here.\\" The sponsor representative coughed and bowed his head slightly. \\"Well- I'm sorry.\\" \\"Again with the informal speech.\\" \\"Ah! No, Mr. Mayor. I apologize.\\" \\"Phew, and from today, let's end your role as the sponsor representative.\\" \\"Yes, Mr. Mayor. Ah! What?!\\" \\"If a sponsor representative of a children's center causes so much trouble, how can we keep him?\\" \\"···No, that's not what I meant.\\" \\"Don't make things worse, let's leave it at that.\\" \\"······\\" The sponsor representative, now former, was at a loss for words. However, the mayor of Jinju, unfazed, spoke again to the composed Woojin. \\"I apologize for the inconvenience during your visit to your hometown. I apologize as the mayor.\\" Woojin, with a steady tone, replied. \\"It's alright.\\" \\"Besides, there's no need for you to take on the role of the children's center's sponsor. I can handle the situation. The 'Kang's Heart' members have already made donations.\\" \\"No, my offer to donate and take on the sponsorship was sincere.\\" Woojin replied nonchalantly. \\"I will take responsibility from now on.\\" Afterward. With the mayor's intervention, peace returned to the children's center. Initially, the flushed sponsor representative apologized several times to the mayor of Jinju and Kang Woojin before leaving the scene. His initial bravado had vanished, resembling a defeated soldier. He probably didn't want to get on the bad side of the mayor of Jinju. Later, the mayor returned to the hall, and the 'Kang's Heart' management team and Kang Woojin exchanged a few words. \\"You've had a tough day. I should have come earlier.\\" \\"···No, no! But brother! I mean, Mr. Woojin! Can I shake your hand??!\\" \\"Me too!\\" Although they were active in the fan club and had seen Woojin in person, it was their first time being so close to Kang Woojin. Woojin, somewhat calmed down, softened his voice while maintaining his persona. \\"Of course.\\" Instead of a handshake, he gave them hugs. He even signed their phone cases and papers. They left the children's center jumping with joy, and Kang Hyunah had been quietly observing her brother's face. \\"Brother.\\" Woojin looked around and lowered his voice. \\"Hey, go home first.\\" \\"No, brother.\\" \\"Go. I'll take care of things here. Listen to me, before I cut off your allowance.\\" Kang Hyunah bowed at a 90-degree angle. \\"Work hard, brother!\\" Watching Kang Hyunah run off, Woojin sighed softly and then entered the hall filled with people waiting for him. As expected. \\"Goodness! Mr. Kang Woojin! It's a pleasure to meet you.\\" \\"Hehe, indeed, you're very tall?? Are you really taking on the role of the children's center's sponsor from today?\\" \\"And he's even making additional donations!\\" Local dignitaries and children's center staff, as well as everyone involved in today's event, flocked to Kang Woojin. The balding mayor of Jinju also had a slightly proud look on his face. From here on, Kang Woojin was overwhelmed. \\"Could you, our Woojin, take a picture with us? Ah- if it's inconvenient, you don't have to.\\" \\"It's okay to take a picture.\\" He had to fulfill his schedule as a donor of 100 million and the official sponsor representative of the children's center. He took several group photos with the mayor of Jinju and local dignitaries. There were also interview requests from the Jinju City Hall YouTube team, but Woojin declined. In the end, Woojin spent about an hour at the center. The last person to talk to Kang Woojin was the mayor of Jinju. His expression was much brighter than at the beginning. \\"Hehehe, Mr. Kang Woojin. Thank you very much for today. There were many unexpected events.\\" \\"It's nothing.\\" \\"Well, about the honorary ambassador offer.\\" \\"It seems difficult. Due to my schedule.\\" \\"Is that so? I understand. Then, is it okay if today's events are reported in the news?\\" \\"Yes.\\" After talking with the mayor, Woojin briefly told the children's center staff. \\"I'll connect you with our company.\\" It was for the sponsorship change. After wrapping up his goodbyes, Kang Woojin left the hall. Interestingly. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" There was a brief silence in the hall. Then, a few seconds later, a scream-like sound exploded simultaneously. \\"Wow!!! Kang Woojin is seriously amazing in person!!\\" \\"No, he seemed a bit cold at first, but he's really mannered, right??!\\" \\"His presence is really... completely insane.\\" \\"An actor is truly an actor. Definitely not the usual aura, right?!\\" By this time, Kang Woojin was already in his car parked outside. \\"Ha- things got a bit big.\\" He started the car with a sigh. The destination was, of course, home. When he arrived home, Kang Hyunah rushed at him, but it was a resounding victory for Kang Woojin. That night, Kang Woojin, Kang Hyunah, and Woojin's parents had dinner together. It was Kang Woojin's last day off, after all. \\"Woojin, are you going to be busy again?\\" \\"Brother! Give me some info on 'Beneficial Evil'! I want to post it on the fan cafe!\\" The dinner was noisy, but Kang Woojin felt a sense of stability. 'It's been a while since I've had this. How long has it been?' It had been a long time since the whole family was together. This time wasn't too bad. However. 'I'm starting to feel a bit restless.' As comfortable as he was, he also wanted to return to being 'actor Kang Woojin'. Had he become a workaholic? He wasn't sure, but after dinner, Woojin said goodbye to Kang Woocheol and Seo Hyunmi and went to bed. And then. -Thump! He pressed the black square attached to the script he had brought. Soon, Woojin's vision was filled with the pitch-black subspace. \\"Let's see-\\" He began to elevate actor Kang Woojin. Monday, the 28th, around noon. Kang Woojin arrived at his officetel in Samseong-dong at about 12:10 PM. In the parking lot, a familiar van was waiting at the right time. Of course, it was the van to pick up Woojin. \\"Hyungnim!!\\" Jang Suwhan, with his large build, was the first to greet Woojin. His energy was overflowing more than usual. When Woojin was resting, his team also had a vacation. Soon, Kang Woojin got into the van and headed to bw Entertainment. bw Entertainment was like a battlefield. It was hard to find any trace of its startup days. The staff had grown from dozens to hundreds, and many top actors had joined. Anyway, Woojin entered the much-expanded CEO's office. Choi Seonggeon, with his ponytail and buried in work, approached with a smirk. \\"Did you rest well?\\" Kang Woojin equipped his proper persona for the first time in a while. \\"Yes, President.\\" \\"There's a lot to convey about the events in Jinju, the articles, and this and that. First.\\" Choi Seonggeon then picked up a transparent file from his seat and handed it to Woojin. \\"The script for episodes 1 and 2 of 'Beneficial Evil' has additional scenes. It means the running time will increase.\\" In other words, there were changes to the script. < Breath (5) > End"},{"instruction":"how to build redis cluster using docker on windows","output":"Setting up a Redis cluster using Docker on Windows involves using Docker Compose to define and run multiple Redis instances that are configured to work as a cluster. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Here is a step-by-step guide to get you started: 1. **Install Docker Desktop for Windows**: Make sure you have Docker Desktop for Windows installed on your system. Docker Desktop includes Docker Compose, so you do not need to install it separately. You can download it from the official Docker website. 2. **Enable WSL 2 (Optional but recommended for better performance)**: Windows Subsystem for Linux Version 2 (WSL 2) is advisable for running Docker on Windows with better performance and compatibility. To enable it, follow the steps provided by Microsoft in their official documentation. 3. **Create a directory**: Create a new directory for your Redis cluster project and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt. 4. **Create a Docker Compose file**: In the directory, create a file named \`docker-compose.yml\`. This file will contain the configuration for your Redis cluster. Here is a simple example of a \`docker-compose.yml\` file for creating a Redis cluster with three master nodes. You can add more master and slave nodes as needed: \`\`\`yaml version: '3' services: redis-1: image: redis:5.0.9 command: redis-server --appendonly yes --cluster-enabled yes --cluster-config-file nodes.conf --cluster-node-timeout 5000 --cluster-announce-ip localhost --cluster-announce-port 6379 --cluster-announce-bus-port 16379 ports: - \\"6379:6379\\" - \\"16379:16379\\" redis-2: image: redis:5.0.9 command: redis-server --appendonly yes --cluster-enabled yes --cluster-config-file nodes.conf --cluster-node-timeout 5000 --cluster-announce-ip localhost --cluster-announce-port 6380 --cluster-announce-bus-port 16380 ports: - \\"6380:6380\\" - \\"16380:16380\\" redis-3: image: redis:5.0.9 command: redis-server --appendonly yes --cluster-enabled yes --cluster-config-file nodes.conf --cluster-node-timeout 5000 --cluster-announce-ip localhost --cluster-announce-port 6381 --cluster-announce-bus-port 16381 ports: - \\"6381:6381\\" - \\"16381:16381\\" \`\`\` 5. **Start the cluster**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your \`docker-compose.yml\` file and run this command to start the cluster: \`\`\` docker-compose up -d \`\`\` 6. **Create the cluster**: After the instances are up and running, you need to connect them into a cluster. You can use the \`redis-cli\` utility to do this. If you don't have \`redis-cli\` installed locally, you can run it from within one of the Redis containers: \`\`\` docker exec -it [Container_Name] redis-cli --cluster create [ip1:port1] [ip2:port2] [ip3:port3] --cluster-replicas 0 \`\`\` For the example above, it would look something like this: \`\`\` docker exec -it [Container_Name] redis-cli --cluster create 127.0.0.1:6379 127.0.0.1:6380 127.0.0.1:6381 --cluster-replicas 0 \`\`\` Replace \`[Container_Name]\` with the actual name or ID of your Redis container. Replace \`ip1:port1\`, \`ip2:port2\`, and \`ip3:port3\` with the actual IP addresses and ports used by your Redis instances. Make sure that the \`--cluster-replicas\` flag is set to the desired number of replicas for each master node. The command above shows \`0\` because it's a simple cluster with no replicas. Remember that creating a cluster with Docker on your local machine using the \`localhost\` IP will successfully create a cluster, but it may not function correctly due to Docker's network isolation. It is recommended to use Docker's network features to properly set up a cluster that can communicate within Docker's network. This guide provides a basic local setup. For a production environment, you would need to consider data persistence, better networking options, security settings, and proper resource management."},{"instruction":"Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6380: Connection refused","output":"The error message \\"Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6380: Connection refused\\" typically means that Redis is not running on the specified port, or it is not accessible due to network issues, such as incorrect firewall or security group settings. Since you're working with Docker on Windows, there are a few common reasons that might be causing this issue when trying to set up a Redis cluster: 1. **Redis is not started**: Ensure that all Docker containers for Redis are running by using the command \`docker ps\` to list all running containers. 2. **Port mapping issues**: Check that the port mappings in your Docker Compose file are correctly set up for the communication between the host and the containers. Also, ensure that the container ports are exposed to the correct host ports. The order of the port mapping is \`host:container\`. 3. **Localhost binding**: When running Docker on Windows, the \`localhost\` inside a container doesn't refer to the Windows host machine, but rather to the container itself. Therefore, trying to connect to other containers using \`127.0.0.1\` or \`localhost\` from inside a container will not work. Instead, you should connect to the other containers using their service names defined in the Docker Compose file as hostnames, or the internal Docker network IP addresses. 4. **Firewall or Antivirus**: Sometimes, your system's firewall or antivirus software can block connections. You might need to allow connections to the desired ports through the firewall. 5. **Redis server not configured properly**: Ensure that the Redis configurations are properly set to allow connections. Based on these common issues, here are steps to troubleshoot and potentially solve the problem: **A. Check Running Containers** Make sure that all the Redis containers are up and running: \`\`\`sh docker ps \`\`\` **B. Verify Networking** If you're running the \`redis-cli --cluster create ...\` command from outside a Docker container, make sure that Redis is configured to listen on \`0.0.0.0\` instead of \`127.0.0.1\` (the latter will be accessible only inside the individual container). You would need to update the command line options in the Docker Compose file (you might need to set \`--bind 0.0.0.0\`). **C. Connect Using Container Names** When setting up the Redis cluster using \`redis-cli\`, use the service names from the Docker Compose file as the hostnames. \`\`\`sh # Use the container names instead of IP addresses docker exec -it redis-1 redis-cli --cluster create redis-1:6379 redis-2:6380 redis-3:6381 --cluster-replicas 0 \`\`\` **D. Disable Firewall/Antivirus Temporarily** Try temporarily disabling your firewall or antivirus software to see if the connection is getting blocked. If you have verified these steps and the issue still persists, you might need to share more information about your setup and take a deeper look at the logs to diagnose the problem further. Check the log files of the Redis containers to see if there are any error messages: \`\`\`sh docker logs [Container_Name] \`\`\` Replace \`[Container_Name]\` with the name or ID of one of your Redis containers."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Monika: \\"Alright, now that everyone's here, let's get to sharing some poems- uh...Natsuki, you're glitching.\\"","output":"Natsuki: \\"What? Glitching? What are you talking about, Monika?\\" Natsuki's voice trembled with confusion as she turned her attention towards Monika. Her piercing green eyes scanned the room cautiously, searching for any signs of abnormality. The other club members, Sayori, Yuri, and MC, exchanged concerned glances. Monika: \\"I'm sorry, Natsuki, but your sprite seems to be acting up. Your movements are... glitchy.\\" Monika's brow furrowed as she observed Natsuki's animated character sprite. It flickered intermittently, briefly displaying distorted images before returning to its normal appearance. Natsuki: \\"What? But I... I can't see anything wrong with myself. Are you sure it's not just your imagination, Monika? Maybe it's a trick of the light or something.\\" Natsuki's voice wavered, betraying her attempt to hide her unease. She crossed her arms in front of her chest and shifted uncomfortably in her seat, as if trying to shake off an invisible disturbance. Sayori: \\"Um, guys, I think Natsuki might be right. I can't see anything weird happening to her either.\\" Sayori's usually cheerful demeanor faltered for a moment, replaced with a flicker of concern. She leaned in closer to Natsuki, briefly examining her character sprite before sitting back with a puzzled expression. Yuri: \\"This is rather peculiar. Glitches have been known to occur within the game before, but this seems different somehow. Almost intentional.\\" Yuri's observant eyes darted between Natsuki and Monika as she brought a hand to her chin, lost in thought. Her curiosity piqued, she couldn't help but wonder what might be causing this anomaly. Monika: \\"I swear this isn't a joke, guys. Something strange is happening to Natsuki, and I can't pinpoint the cause. It's as if... as if someone is intentionally messing with her character sprite.\\" Monika's usually composed demeanor began to falter under the weight of uncertainty. Her words hung heavy in the air, leaving the club members to contemplate the gravity of the situation. MC: \\"Wait, you mean to say that someone is altering Natsuki's sprite on purpose? But who would do something like that?\\" MC's voice cut through the tension, echoing the collective confusion and concern of the club members. The room fell silent, the weight of their unanswered questions sinking heavily upon them. As the literature club sat in contemplative silence, the glitching continued to plague Natsuki's character sprite, casting an eerie atmosphere over their once serene clubroom. The members realized that there was something far more sinister at play, and they knew they had to uncover the truth before it was too late."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

I'm glitching? That's ridiculous! I'm perfectly fine.\\" Sayori: \\"No, Natsuki, you really are glitching. Your body's flickering, and your movements seem kind of...robotic.\\" Natsuki: *frustratedly grabs at her hair* \\"Ugh! Why is this happening now? I just wanted to share my poem!\\" Yuri: \\"Perhaps it's another manifestation of the game's code acting up, but it seems localized only to Natsuki. Monika, do you have any idea why this is happening?\\" Monika: *nervously fidgeting* \\"I wish I did, but honestly, I have no clue. This...this isn't something I have control over, I promise.\\" Sayori: \\"We believe you, Monika. We know you wouldn't intentionally cause this. But what can we do to help Natsuki?\\" Monika: \\"I'm not entirely sure. Maybe restarting the game or reloading a previous save file could fix it. It's worth a try.\\" Yuri: \\"I concur. Let's attempt that and hope for the best.\\" (Together, they exit the clubroom and make their way to the computer. Monika takes charge and navigates through the game's files, searching for a solution.) Monika: \\"Okay, let's try reloading the game from a previous save and see if that resolves Natsuki's glitching.\\" (She clicks a few buttons, and the screen goes black before reloading to an earlier point.)
